Question,Answer
Can I actually take this case underwater?,Yes I went and swam in the lake with it and had no problems
is this phone slip proof,"Slip proof?... If you mean phone sliding in case it was very secure when I used it, but I did only last 24 hours again due to the extremely horrible sound quality and low volume while the case was on my phone!"
Does this work with the samsung galaxy s relay?,I'm not sure I just know it doesn't fit the Active model. The Active is a little larger than the regular S4 and the bottom buttons are different.
does it make your phone look fat?,No
Can the protective plastic screen cover be removed?,"It dosn't matter it does not close correctly, you can plainly see it would not be protected from water, me and my husband could not get it to close securely it's just junk you get what you pay for"
Does it have a built in screen protector?,Yes there is a thing plastic screen that covers the front - the color is just printed on it. It does kind of muffle the ear piece since it goes completely over it with no holes.
it does fit galaxy s4 sgh-m919,Yes
is this case really waterproof?,Yes
have you done the drop test multiple times ?,"Yes, I have... Plus non test - tests... I dropped it off the table and nothing, but a tiny scratch on the plastic screen that goes over the phone... I also dropped it in the sink of water and it floated up and no water went inside the case! It's a great buy!!"
IS THIS OTTER BOX,No
Fit s4 active?,Fits regular s4 not mini
I really don't want to wait the 45 days it takes to get this. That is why I am hesitant to purchase this. What is the soonest you could send it to me?,"Thanks for your interest in this item. The delivery time will need 10-20 working days, can you accept it?"
Is case rubberized?,"No, it is slick"
do they sell a belt clip case for this with the extended battery?,Sorry i do not know. i just put in my pocket
Is case rubberized to keep from slipping,"No, slippery shiny plastic... the worst thing about it, battery otherwise is ok"
The picture shows that this case is black but the description says that it is white. So which is it black or white?,I don't have the extended battery with a different back. I have the standard 2600 mAh Anker battery and it is white..
Is there anyway I can get a s-view to fit with this? And also How much longer does the charge last?,"S-view doesn't work so you can use the camera. The battery back, for me lasted 10-12 hours with heavy usage."
"So, will my Otter Box case still work with my S$ after adding this extended battery case??",Sorry no because it doubles as a carrying case
Does this work for a Verizon S4?,"I have ATT but I dont see why it wouldn't work, the case is for any S4"
"Can the internal battery be used without the battery back? Say, if I wanted to use a case and use the back if I run low on juice later in the day?",Not really enough info to answer the question. I use this battery with my S4. It could be used without the Phone back but I do not see why anyone would need to do that since it is very easy to remove the back.
"how battery work, 24 hours",This replaces both the battery in your phone and the battery cover on the back of your phone. It gives you a much larger battery which results in a longer lasting charge. In subsequent testing I have actually had my phone last for a little over three days on one full charge.
does this work with the sprint model?,I just got this for my Sprint phone and it works fine.

"I have a Belkin, very slim case on my iPhone currently (covers the back and sides of phone). Will this fit if I leave that case on?",Ashley it will but it'll be a very tight fit. There's no need for another case once u get this one. There's a case inside of this one that protects the sides as well. I ordered 2 of these and I like them.
Is it easy to take the phone out of the actual case? I don't want an actual cover for my phone so I would like if I could take it out fast?,It seems to be real easy to take the phone out and yet it feels secure when in place. I've popped mine out on several occasions and no problem yet!
"Is it true that this case prevents the flash from working? Also, is there a soft lining that protects the glass screen? Any scratching?","I can't really answer your first and last question because I haven't gotten my phone yet. But for the second question, the diary covers the screen really well and I put this plastic thing in the case to test the scratching to see if my cards would scratch my phone and it was okay. Not much scratching according to my test. But you do get a screen protector which should help that."
Does this come with a strap that attaches to the hole at the top so you can carry it on your wrist?,I tried one...it can work but the case is vinyl so depending on the weight of the strap it may make a crease or bend but it's sturdy so it may not tear. The hole is pretty small as well so the connecter would work best attached to a sturdy jump ring.

"Is the wallet (cash) compartment big enough to hold a couple of keys (no key ring, just flat keys) without bulging too much?","Maybe one, but with four cards and two bills folded in half it bulges quite a bit. It depends on which color you get too, I bought the brown one for my husband and the mint one for myself. For some reason his closure flap is much bigger than mine is, so it handles the bulk better.

How protected is it from being dropped? Will the screen crack? Can the sides get chipped or scratced as well?,"I'd hate to have to actually ""test"" this product with my new phone, but it's a very secure hard plastic shell which is in cased in a faux leather-like billfold flip cover. Appears to me you'd have to have the cover open and slam it on a pretty hard surface to possibly do any damage so I'm pretty confident of its impact safety. Sides and back are completely secure.

"Most of the reviews say that the Magnet ""interferes"" with the S-Pen. How accurate are they? And does the interference lead to permanent damage?",No it does not interfere with the S Pen. I have had this case for about 6 months now and I never experienced any problems with my S Pen.

"Hi Guys, wondering how does this case feel like when the top cover is folded all the way back. Does it lay flat on the back ? is it bulky? Thank you",Yes we liked
"The product description indicates that the case is for the Galaxy Note 3, but the reviews all seem to reference the S 4. Which is correct?",S4
"Doesn't the magnets in the cover affect the magnetic strips of the credit cards, wiping them out?",I keep two credit cards in the cover all the time. It has not had any effect on my credit cards.
I have a Samsung Galaxy 10.1. What size cover do I need 3 or 4,"You need a 10"" cover for a 10"" Samsung galaxy"
Is it easy to get in and out of jean pockets?,"The case is slim, not bulky."
"Several reviewers have mentioned problem with their screens when using this case on the samsung galaxy note 3, due to the magnet. Have you noticed it?","No, the magnet has not been an issue with my screen."
dose this have a slot for the s pen?,Nope
note,For s4
"How many cards can the slots hold, without deforming the case, or making it too awkward? Can you put multiple cards in each slot?",I have about two cards in each slot. It makes the case a bit bulky but it still closes no problem. So the answer is yes you can put more than one in each slot.

Does it come with a strap so you can wear as a wristlet?,No
"I know it does not come with a lanyard, but the pictures look like there is a hole to put a lanyard in, has anyone tried that?",I haven't tried that but there is a hole that might be suitable for a lanyard.
Does this case allow access to the note 3 stylus?,Yes it does but after repetitive use the cutout starts to bend out making the case very unattractive. I don't use the S pen much but from other reviews apparently the magnet in the case may cause issues with using the S pen.
Do the magnet on this case interfere with the air command feature for the note 3 (The pop up command that appears using the S pen)?,"Yes, it is not working in the area near and around the magnets."

Does this come with a wrist strap?,No. It didn't
For those who've purchased white...how is the soil factor? Thinking about grime and skin oils tinting the color.,I use hand sanitize to clean my case
Does the magnet interfere with the S pen functionality?,"No it actually is wonderful, no interference."
Will it fit the new Moto x?,I don't see why it wouldn't. I've never seen the new moto x but if its similar to the old one it should. I would try it and see but be sure to check the return policy before just incase you get it and it doesn't fit.
do you think the case is protective if phone is dropped?,Yes! The phone has been dropped several times as I have a 18mth old who loves to play with my phone!
"the photo looks like there's a pink casing that surrounds the phone in addition to the wallet cover part, are there two parts to the case?",Yes- the pink casing is attached to the wallet cover. It is not removable. You slip the phone inside the casing (very nice snug fit) and then close the wallet cover over the phone.
The two cases that I ordered did not come with any instructions on the lifetime warranty. Where can I get more information on the lifetime warranty?,From the manufacture online.
"1. When calls are made, what do you do with the cover? Does it fold back perhaps? 2. Can you be on the phone with the cover closed?",You may fold the flip back and the front flip would be held by the magnetic closure. Also you can also use it when closed. There are ear cutouts to listen. But the flap closed can sound kind of muffled.
Magnetic closure or Snap closure?,Magnetic closure
Is there a raised lip to protect the screen when placed face down and does it interfere with touch screen functionality at the edges? THANKS!,The case will protect your phones screen.
I'd like to know if the case has a covering over the viewing area?,No. It wraps around edges and back
"Is this for the most current Moto X, 2014 version","No, the 2013 Moto X. I did have the case I ordered from Motorola, but the case became deformed near the volume button after 4 Mons. This case has held its shape so far and was a third if the cost."
"Does the cover actually cover the screen, or does the case slie off or open to expose the screen?","No, it does not cover the screen, it is simply a case that goes around the edges and the back."
"Does it prevent ""pocket"" dialing?","Hello there--the Great Shield Guardian fits the back of the Moto X and protects all back there very well, but the face or screen is protected only slightly from scratching if you set the phone down on it's face. The screen (in my opinion) is still exposed to the possibility of pocket dialing."
is the purple case see through?,The bottom half is see thru with a purple tint
Does it have cutouts for the buttons on the side? The pics don't show that.,The case is molded for the buttons. I haven't had a problem hitting power or the volume rocker. They are covered (which is kind of a bummer from a MotoMaker standpoint) but it's a nice case. Access to the dimple and the case's soft touch back made it worth the purchase to me.
is moto x 1ra generation?,Yes
Will this case fit the LG G2 from Verison?,Yes great case I loved it

how well does the belt holster work? Hold phone securely? Easy to remove and replace?,The holster holds the phone pretty snug. Even thought its a snug fit removing the phone from the holster is not a problem. Its a snug enough fit that the phone doesn't come off the holster without user intervention but loose enough that you can get the phone out with minimal effort.
will this work for the G2 from Verizon?,Yes
Does it fit the tmobile model ?,Im verizon and it not fit. The case did not close no matter how i tried. Hope this helps.

"Will this phone work with a Verizon sim card? If so, what kind should I purchase?",I'm not sure about a Verizon sim. I used an AT&T SIM card but honestly the phone was not worth the money I paid. I bought one and had to pay the return shipping myself to send back to exchange for another and it was no better. So to be honest I wouldn't recommend even buying this phone. Sorry I couldn't help.

my tablet has a 7' screen but the tablet is about 8 inches. would it fit? i bought two already and didn't,"The fit was tight, but did work. My two tablets were 8"". One corner slides into a stationary holder on case and then the other three corners snap in. I too had tried two other cases before finding these. A word of caution though, this fit my 8"" tablets."
my tablet says it is 8 inch capacitive touch panel do not know if this case will serve me,I would not trust that sizing for this seller....My tablet is an 8 inch Android Tablet and it does NOT fit in this case.

what color is available?,black
"is this good to protect the entire phone, or will it just break when it hits the groud on its front?",The two plastic parts on the side hold the phone well enough regardless of whether it's settled into the top or bottom. The edges and corners are also raised high enough to protect it from flat surfaces.
Does this have a front piece to it....does it cover the front of the phone or is it just two back pieces?,It is only the back piece but I have a lumia 52o and theres a little ridge that actually works pretty well against falls straight on the screen
Is this for the Nokia 520 or 521? I have a 520.,64mm x 9.9mm x 119.9mm Lumia520 64mm x 9.9mm x 124.0mm Lumia521 4.1mm diff
"Hi, I see that the picture says this is for the 521; do you guarantee this will fit the 520 properly?",I does fit the AT&T 520 with a small gap (like the size of 2-3mm) lengthwise. But when you put on the second part to this case it takes up some of the space giving it a comfortable fit. I think it's a good buy for the price because it covers those corners and the screen is recessed in the case. Good buy for under $10
Can I hang this on my belt?,No.
the pieces that come together behind is very fragile and broke his day at rest is ta very well protected cell can be improved or what the warranty,"there is no warranty,just return it within time aloud. I didn't bother."
previously I had a case for the lumia 520 but it was to tight and cause the power button not to work properly. have any one experienced this problem?,No I never had any problems with the case.
Does it fit the 520,I think my sons phone is the 520.
"I want to know whether this case is breakable if dropped on a hard concrete floor. Is it a ""Plastic"" or a ""Rubber?"". I need a rubber for my child.","It's rubber and plastic....the plastic part has a kickstand to prop phone up. I'm sure if would crack if that part was open but other than that, no. I've had it for a while with no problem and the screen protector is the first one I used and I still have the same one on.....I give it 5 stars!"
does it interfere with the buttons and ports on the phone?,Have not had an issue this far with charging port or headphones. Buttons work fine as well.
The color says navy blue but it looks a lot lighter of a blue than navy blue. Does anyone know is it the color blue shown in the picture or not?,It is the color in the picture not navy blue. I love mine
This will fit for a 520 correct?,"No. It won't. This amazon item page is intentionally deceiving customers. Check out the photo of the Reiko box in which the case comes: it clearly shows it is meant for the 521 only! It fits the 520 so loosely it tends to cover the speaker hole, and makes handling the buttons very difficult. Don't be deceived by the other answers: the 521 is bigger, and if the case doesn't have a snug fit, then it is just plain useless."
"The phone has a see through screen/cover for the camera and the main screen, right?",No I don't believe so...
Does this case have a lanyard loop?,"No it doesn't :( just a kick stand, but it protects my phone well."
"I have been told that this case is too big for the nokia lumia 520, If I shrink the silicone to make it fit snugly, will the plastic part still fit?",I got this info off google. The size for the 520 is 4.72 x 2.52 inches and my 521 is about 4.9 inches so in theory I don't the case would work unless you get a plastic or rubber piece that will fit perfectly on the top and bottom to give it a secure fit with the camera hole.
has anyone dropped their phone with this on it? how does it hold up?,"Hi, yes I dropped my phone and the screen protector shattered the phone remained completely intact. Awesome buy!"
Will this work the samsung bumper cover case,I guess it will. I have the spigen case and it fits perfect.
Will this work the samsung bumper cover case,It should. It worked for my phone.
has anyone dropped their phone with this on it? how does it hold up?,I have dropped my phone MULTIPLE TIMES! No problems - no cracks - no scratches. I do have a rubberized case as well
"If I already have a skin protector on the back of my S4, will the screen protector still fit?",Yes
Does it work with a supcase,Yes On mine s4 worked well and smooth
Would this screen protector work with an otterbox commuter case?,"I have never used an otterbox, but I believe that comes with it's own screen protector. I cannot really answer if it will work for another case. I use mine directly on a phone itself along with a slim armour case. And I love it. GGreat visibility."
"I am getting a replacement phone, will I be able to take the screen protector off and put it on my new phone?",Getting New one
does this work for the new galaxy s5 from t-mobile.....,"The item I purchased was specifically for the Galaxy S4. It may be that the company makes them for the S5, but I can't attest to that."
Does this screen protector cover the camera at all? or does it have a cut out over the camera?,The screen protector does not cover the camera at all.
Will this cover unlock phone like other magnetic covers?,"It will show the lock screen when you open it, along with the time, then u can swipe the screen to unlock it."
is this for the the moto x 1st generation,"Yea its for 1st gen moto x, and its a good case, I'm using it right now."
will this protect phone from screen cracks when it falls?,"It has a little suction cup to keep it close, should protect it."
Will this cover work on the MotoX from Republic Wireless?,"Yes, it works."
Is it real leather?,NO. This is synthetic Leather NOT real leather.
"Just received this item, absolutely no instructions and I am unable to pair it to my I phone 5. Any suggestions or is there a way to acquire instruct","Mine came with a little 1 page instruction sheet. I paired mine to an iPhone 5, so yes. The 'phone/power' button also triggers pairing. Press and hold the 'phone/power' button for 7 seconds. The light will flash red and blue. That signals pairing mode. On your iPhone, goto Bluetooth settings. You should see SP100340. Select that. If asked for a password, enter 1234. Paired. All buttons are multifunction. +/- short press= switch song; long press= volume Music: short press phone/power to pause start. Phone: short press to answer; long press to refuse"
How do I charge the device? I didn't receive any instrucitons?,"The end with the light pops off, the connection for USB is there to attach to cable to charge"
Is it water proof like the Pyle Pedal Sound 3-in-1 Waterproof Bluetooth Bicycle Speaker? They pretty much look like each other in all other respects.,"I have not held the Pyle in my hands, but they appear to be exactly the same judging by the pictures. I wouldn't call these waterproof, just water resistant. They are designed for those instances where you are on your bike and it begins to rain. They would not fair too well being immersed in water."
How long does battery last playing music?,The speaker is small and isn't really meant to play music unless it is a really soft song at a low volume or else the speaker will probably end up blowing. I use it for driving and taking calls and the battery life is kind of poor I have to charge it about once every week and I don't drive that much in a week. Hope this helps!
I have the case works well bot top plastic piece broke does anyone know how to get a new one?,"Nope, think you have to get a new case"
Can I use with iphone 5 s?,no you can not it does not work . not only that it is very flimsy.
Does anyone know of a headphone plug which will actually fit through the hole in this case to the headphone jack?,The iphone headphones that came with your iphone will work and the bowers & wilkins P3 headphones will easily fit. I have a pair of P3's and they are outstanding. I recommend them over beats any day
Will this case fit the Motorola droid maxx razr?,I use mine for the driod ultra I do not know if the RAZR is the same size if it is you will like it.
Will the red of my phone will show thru with this cover? tx!,Yes!
"Is the main body of the case hard/clear plastic so if I put a picture in there you would see it, or is the whole back of the phone clear gel?",The phone itself CV is hard plastic back. The gel cover has a diamond pattern on it. You can see color but not clear pictures.
can't seem to get itunes to recognize the iphone through the thunderbolt cable...,It is not the thunderbolt cable. The cable that comes with the case is only for charging. You will have to sync your phone wirelessly or remove it from the case to use the regular thunderbolt cable to access iTunes.
Finally got this thing to charge but even after being plugged in all night it doesn't charge completely. Anybody get it to charge fully?,"It takes awhile with the regular cord, I bought a stronger wall plug, I believe it was a 10W. Usb with the regular wall plugs don't give as much power."
I still can't get this to work. I charged it for several hours. It sat for a couple of days and now it won't turn on.,I requested for a refund because we were having the same issue.
"Not very happy with this - I have yet to get it to work. After it's charged, how long does it hold it's charge if it's sitting dormant?","Hi. It should double your phone's battery life. If your phone gets depleted after 8-12 hours of use then it is safe to assume that your total estimated battery life with the case is 16-24 hours. You can turn off the case when not in use. Just press and hold the power switch to turn the battery power on and off, and press it once to see the battery's status."
How long does it take to charge? I've had it plugged in for a few hours - nothing yet. Thanks.,"For this Belkin grip 2000 mAh battery case, you can charge it at 2 amps and it will take 1 hour. It will take a half hour at 4 amps."
I just got this - no instructions. It looks like it can't be turned on and off? Is it always charging? What's the short cable for?,"Hi, zyggistardust. This Belkin power battery case can be turned on and off. The short cable that comes with the case is the Micro-USB charging cable.

"I see case is cut out so camera is accessible, but how functional is it really when taking pics? Esp for fast moving toddler or dogs?","Hi dog29! Catharina here from The Friendly Swede! I do apologize for the tardy reply! It should be as accessible as it would be without the case.

Does the holder get in the way when using the phone to your ear? Carol,"Hi Carolyn! The wallet case, by nature, is a bit more to hold next to your ear than a ""normal"" case. The way most people have been using these comfortably is how a few customers here have mentioned, by folding the ""wallet side"" behind the phone side and then holding it up to your ear. I alternate between a few of our cases and the wallet case took some getting used to, but once you get the hang of it, it's very handy :) If there's anything else, just let me know.

will this fit a droid maxx ultra?,"There is no such phone as the Droid Maxx Ultra. It's just called the Droid Maxx. It was believed at one time that this device would be called the Droid Razr Maxx Ultra, but Motorola ended up naming in the Droid Maxx. The smaller version of this phone is called the Droid Ultra and this case will not fit that phone."
wireless charging,It does work with the TYLT wireless charger in both vertical and horizontal orientation
The measurement on my droid maxx(motxt1080m16) is 5.41 I would like to know if this is the correct fitting case?,"yes, it fits very good on my droid maxx"

Does this fit the latest Droid Maxx that one would purchase from Verizon?,Yes. Fits perfectly. I purchased my Droid Maxx from Verizon on 1/5/15. Peter
does this cover have a built in screen protector ?,"No, this case only protects everything else but the screen. I had to purchase a separate screen protector. I've been using the Skinomi screen protector, however it does not stay down when you use this case. I've gone through two but I'm afraid of asking customer service for yet another screen protector since the first two did not work so well when used with this case. The case is excellent. It serves its purpose."
Is this like an otterbox?,"No not all. Otter box covers the whole phone and is bulky , very safe but adds more thickness to your phone . This case covers all but the front screen , is thin yet durable and you should use a screen protector also. The sides wrap around front screen so if you LA your phone face down it is still protected and not on thrscreen itself . Very nice case . You will not regret getting his one ."
Is this case solid metal or plastic? ie. not flexible rubber or silicon.,No. Its not metal or plastic. I think it must be some rubber or silicone compound. It's flexible but provides excellent protection. The case is still on my phone right now. I love it!!

"Will a cigarette lighter still work in this? I've tired other splitters that provide 2 ""12v Power Outlets"" but cigarette lighters don't work in them.","Good question! My cigarette lighter does not fit, (hole too small). So standard US size cigarette lighter might not fit. All I can say is that mine doesn't fit so I guess yours will neither. I could be wrong but assume it won't fit. Chargers fit as they should."
Does it interfer with the FM transmission and playback quality of an IPod adaptor when plugged in as some other sockets do?,My adapter broke after only a few uses so I couldn't tell you
"The part that plugs into the cigarette lighter is on the side, not the middle? It won't fit unless it's on the side. Thanks","Yes, it's directly in line with the outlet (straight back). It's not centered between the USB and the charger. I hope this helps. It works very well too."
Will this charge a GPS Navigation device or just power it?,"I don't have a gps unit, but it charges an iPad via the USB port and simultaneously charges my iphone in a charging cradle that's connected to the lighter adapter port. I would think it would charge your gps just fine. Hope this helps..."

Has the cutout for the speaker been changed to the correct side?,All cut outs are in the correct location.
Would it protect it if i drop the phone screen facing down ?,To some degree yes. It has a rim of protection around it that woukd cushion a fall. It woukd not protect against something that hit only the screen like a rock or anything else like that.
Does the Belt clip swivel?,Yes it does. Case works well.
Will this fit a 1st Gen Moto X?,I bought it and doesn't fit my 1st gen Moto X
Does this case fit the Moto X Developer's edition? First gen means nothing to me... Thanks ~J~,First generation means nothing to me as well. I honestly do not know. The clip itself will work with the slim otter box case as well. The solid black one that is.
Will this case fit the AT&amp;T model?,Yes Jennifer that's what I have is the AT&T model moto x it fits it great
will this case fit an At&amp;T phone?,I don't believe they can fix the center piece in middle rotate round part
my camera is in the middle on my C not on the left side,You have a fake iPhone.
"I need a non-slick case as my hands are sometimes clammy and have dropped previous phones. Does this case have a matte or ""rougher"" texture?",The edges are matte but the back is slick. I've never dropped it.
does it come with screen protector,"Yes, it comes with 1 screen protector that fits perfectly. It's not in any fancy packaging, just in a little baggie. I have to say, I've applied a lot of different screen protectors to a lot of different gadgets, but this screen protector laid down so smoothly and with ZERO bubbles, that I was satisfied with my first try! I would have paid $10 for that alone! LOL"
"If dropped, will my phone break","I guess every drop is different. Mine fell out of my evening bag unbeknownst to me onto the concrete. A fellow theater-goer ran up to me from behind and handed my iphone back and it worked perfectly. I looked down at my evening bag and sure enough it was wide open and had come undone. My Spigen case is the clear one. Again, every drop is different, but it protected my phone in this circumstance."
Does it clip onto a belt?,"NO. Is a regular case in that sense. No clips. But awsome feeling in the hand and the way the buttons work really well and easely 100% os the time, is incredible!"
does this case have a dust cover at the charging port ?,No it does not have a dust cover at the charging port.
It says this product includes a screen protector + 2 design graphics. What is a design graphic?,Basically two random backgrounds I threw them out im sorry I really don't remember but its better to leave it clear it looks better
What kind of screen protector? Anti glare?,I don't think so. It was included with the caSe. There was one for front and back. It does have the precut areas to fit specifically to the iPhone 5c.
will this fit an iPhone 5?,I use it on the 5c and I think it would fit a 5s even better. This is a great case.
Does the case have a raised bumper/bezel above the screen?,Yes it does. I am the type of person who is constantly dropping my phone and it was always 100% okay.
Will this case accomodate the otterbox skin?,"No, it doesn't fit otter box case."

Does anyone use this with a Puregear Dualtek case? The case is 5.85 x 3.16 x .638,"I don't use a case with mine, but if your case is 5.85 long it would not fit, or be very tight at the least."

Will this holster fit an LG G2 with a Diztronic rubber case?,"Yes,it will fit"

Will it fit AT&amp;T LG G2 with Tudia Ultra Slim Melody Series TPU case?,"Yes, it will fit it"
Just be honest - will this fit an S4 naked (no case) SNUG?,"I have a clear thin protective case on mine, not a defender or otter box type and it fits snug, so really can't tell you if totally naked it fits just as snug."
will my phone fit this case with an otterbox protective case on it?,"sorry for the delay, i'm not sure those are pretty big. i have a body glove cover that fits around the back & sides & overlaps the front some (no screen cover) and it fits fine."

what are the contents that comes with this phone,"Phone, battery, battery door , usb cable, charger, user manual , box"
does this have factory warranty?,"From what was told me Yes, but when I called in with my complaint about the crack that was there when I got it the Amazon wireless circle said I had to send in 100.00 along with the phone. That was just to check it out. If it was proven to be a factory defect I would get my money back, and we all know how that goes. These companies always find fault on the user, not their company. So I guess it would not matter if it does have a factory warranty when they are going to find fault against you, you know what I mean?? I hope this has helped you out with your decision. The phone is a great phone and my 11 year old daughter is very, very Happy with it!!! And that makes me Happy for sure! Have a nice day."

How is this phone for grip? I have some nerve damage and Nexus 5 is too slippy without a silicone cover.,"It has a nice texture to it. It never sticks in my pocket but I also never feel like it is going to slip out of my hand. I would recommend it based upon fit, finish, and cost."
Does these case is a shock proof?,I dropped accidentally in a hard stairs and I do see little scratches where it landed on floor. Other than that no breakage and phone still working. Excellent product with the price and I still like it.

"Is there enough space in between case and phone to place a 0.1"" iMagnet metal plate inside?","I wouldn't think so, is a very tight fitting case."
In the bottom right corner there are two little holes and a slightly raised 'nub' shall i call it in the middle. What is that for exactly?,A placement for a lanyard would be my guess.
How does it feel on your fingers? Does it feel sticky or natural just like they claimed?,"The feel is good, my package came with a crease that ruined two of the 3 pieces though. I haven't heard a response from them on replacement......."

Does this work with the LG G2 VS980 model?,This is for the Verizon model only.

Does this case work for the T-Mobile version of the G2?,"From what I've read, the Verizon version of the G2 is thicker so it may not. This case may be a little loose on the non Verizon version. I also read there are slight differences in the placement of the sensors. Hopefully this helped, if it was me if buy the car that was actually made for the correct one."
does it protect screen,There is no screen protector with this case. You need to buy some. It does have raised edges along the screen so it can lay flat on surfaces without damaging it.
does the case have a hole on the backside for the mic right above the camera on the At&amp;t model?,This would be the wrong case for at&t. This is exclusively for Verizon wireless g2.
How does this case fit with one of the Tempered glass screen protectors?,I have one on my G2 and it doesn't interfere with the Gel layer and vice versa.
does the wireless charging work well with this case on?,Works fine with my cheap Chinese wireless charger

Is there a holster clip carrier that will fit with the shell cover on phone?,No i couldnt find 1
Does it fit the Sprint version?,Honestly im using T mobile so im not sure but as far as i know LG G2s are all same model except verizon. So YES it will be fit sprint version.
Will this case make me feel safe while I go about my day?,I love this case it works perfectly yes it'll feel safe
"So, is this case for the ATT G2? a lot of the cases I have seen also don't work well with a screen protector. Does this have any problems with it?","Well first of all, personally i like this case. Gribs are good and surface of the back side feel like sturdy metal strong BUT just like you said this case dont want you to put screen protector on it. Because if you put screen protector and use this case, case will make your screen protector bubbly and peel off."
measurements,"5-11/16"" 3-1/16"" by 5/8"" thick. Add just a 16th or less on the corners. I reccomend this case highly. Have a great day, Brett"
Is this for sprint version of the lg g2,"No actually this is for all other kind of carrier like tmobile,at&t,sprint. And one more tip: if youre plan to use this case, then you have to remove front protection films on the screen bcuz that case dosent want you to put screen protector. (It makes screen protector bubley)"
Is this for the T-Mobile version of the LG G2?,It is by far the best case protection for the LG G2 T-Mobile version on the market today. Although Otterbox is now coming out with their case
will it fit on the at&amp;t model,I have an LG g2 phone from at t and it fits perfect
Will my Beats L-shaped headphone jack fit into this case?,I'm not positive on the type of jack that has but just about any headphone jack will fit. It has a slot specifically for L shaped jacks. You should be good.
verizon compatible?,Yes it was.

1) Do the power and volume buttons work well with the cover? are they easy to press? 2) Does the back limit NFC connectivity in any way?,"1) The buttons work perfectly well, I even find that adjusting volume when the phone is in my pocket is easier to do with the case since the buttons are a bit bulkier than the rocker on the phone 2) I haven't used the NFC all that much, but I did try it with one of my cards in my wallet and it worked fine."

can the clip be removed from the holster without breaking the clip or case?,"It isn't made to be removed and reattached, but I was able to remove the clip from the holster piece which left me with a flat cover for my phone. I've been using the case and the makeshift cover since I got the phone and would recommend them.

"I've ""rolled-over"" my minutes so many times that I now have many more minutes than I'll ever use. How to just buy more time, not minutes? Help","The only way I know of to just add days (not any minutes) is to go and enroll in their ""Service Protection Plan"" what it does is when your days runs out it adds on 30 more days for $5.99. I believe you have to have a credit card on file for it to charge when the days run out.

Where to you pry it open? What area of the case. I don't wnt to break it,"I just did it, but it was not obvious. The people who say to remove the silicone cover first are right. The key is that you have to realize that the silicone cover is one big piece -- I kept trying to find a seam to separate it. Instead, hold the case as if you were looking at the phone, and bend back the silicone cover at the corners (away from you). Do that on all 4 corners of the screen -- you'll need to stretch it a bit, but it will come off. Then, you'll just have the hard inner case, which is opened by popping the 2 tabs on the side and the 1 at the top."
how do you get the case open to put it on the phone?,"Remove the rubber part from the top, then pull it out of the bottom. Then lightly lift the square clips on the side from the back.

Does the case back or sides discolor as so many clear cases do?,"My case did not discolor. As the last commentor noted, you do have to be very deliberate when you press the on/off button on the side because there is not a cutout for it. My husband carefully cut away the raised covering on his and likes it better now. I want to do that also. Good value for low cost."

Will this fit the MotoX 2nd generation phone? Thanks.,No it's designed to fit the original Moto X.

Will this fit the Moto G 1st gen?,This does fit the 1st gen Moto X.
Does the case get dirty/less clear with much usage?,"I have had the case for 4 months, it still looks new other than a scuff on the corner where i dropped it. I thought the rubber gasket part would turn yellow as clear plastics that are not polycarbonate can be unstable- but it has not oxidized at all to my surprise. Looks great still!"
Is there a trick to getting the phone into the case? Put the bumper on the phone first? Or try to cram the phone into the bumper-lined case?,"I put the bumper on first and then muscled the plastic on second. It wasn't easy, but the flip side is that stays on well."
do i need a screen protector in addition to the case?,Yes. The case doesn't offer an protection and the Moto X is prone to scratching.
Does the case leave access to the headphone jack? Also can it easily and accidentally slip out of my pocket while im sitting down?,"All ports are easily accessible.

is there some sort of guarantee with this cover?,well that depends on what you're looking for. OtterBox has always stood by their products for me and replaced anything and everything is so fat that it's over broken. it is well worth the money to me
How does the warranty work? Will Otterbox replace the case if broken/worn out later on? (Even if bought through Amazon?),No Clue Albert. The box is pretty much indestructible. I would not worry about it breaking unless you run it over with a car.
"just received the screen, what tool kit do I need to purchase?",I would YouTube it because there's a lot more to changing out the screen then just taking out a couple of screws. Be very careful because each and every tiny screw has a purpose
Do I need the frame?,No. The screen sits inside the silver back of the iPhone. You will need to get the adhesive to secure the screen to the frame.

is this good for At&amp;T phones?,"Yes, for all iPhone 4s models."
does it come with the tool kit?,NO-- there was no toolkit included. I'm not sure why there was in the past and not anymore. I'm sending mine back because there was no toolkit and there was no wire mesh over the earspeaker like it advertises about 5 times on the main page.

what's the manufacturer warranty on this unit? That info would be very helpful to be listed in the spec/description,1 year
"They said the new upgrade would include dim lights for the buttons, what happened to that?","They ARE there. The unit I ordered and received November 2014 DOES have lighted buttons when the unit is turned on. There is a hidden photosensor behind the rear facing grill which acts to progressively brighten the top buttons as ambient light decreases. It's quite nice. They are not overly bright, so they aren't distracting. The top buttons also have white symbology (which is different from the product pictures on the black unit I ordered) which makes them easier to identify."
"Is this device ok to be used outdoors? Beach, etc.? Can the sound be heard well and clearly?",Is pretty loud and clear sound. But for the beach I would recommended to cover it with a large zip lock bag to protect it from the sand.
I use the AT&amp;T go phone sim card. I can make calls and text but not multimedia text and cannot access the web. Is there a way to get this phone to get this phone to access all the features such as the web and multimedia texting and so forth??,I am using a Costa Rica Kolbi SIM card and cannot browse.

I have been given a leitz charging station but I don't have the power cable to connect it to the mains...what type of adaptor do I need to buy?,the station itself doesnt need one to my knowledge. you only need cables for whatever youre going to charge.
Can the ipad sit in the back dock with a case on? What are the measurements of that space?,"It all depends on the case you have for your iPad. The new Targus case I have does not fit in the docking station unless I only use the back flap of the case in the slot provided to prop the iPad up. So to answer the question the iPad itself is not in the docking slot, rather cover for my iPad sits in the slot and works perfectly well in my situation. My wife has a Oberon case and does not fit in the slot at all. I think the docking station was designed for the iPad to be used without any protective case, with seems like an oversite.

I'd advise buying a different speaker, the circuitry sucks, it's hard to fix, and the sound is not as loud as it sounds like it should. Keep looking."

What is the wattage output in this speaker?,3watts rms
i cant get mine to charge what should i do?,"That's not a problem I've had with mine, but contacting the seller would be a good start"
How do you turn on discovery mode?,"It's automatic when you turn it on. I've found that some devices link up easier than others. Sometimes I have to look for CC-B SPEAKER on my list of available devices and select it. I'm very happy with my Brick, I use it all the time."
can i use it wired to my tablet,Yes. It has an aux input on back of speaker. Wire was also included.
Can I use it as a microphone with just a wired connection? I want to use it with my desktop which does not have bluetooth.,U can use it as a speaker - it has a aux connection

Will this holder accomodate by Galaxy S5?,"yes, no problem whatsoever. See my Amazon review."

I don's see any reviews on how well this works with the Droid Ultra - can anyone provide feedback on how well it works?,"Hi Jessica, I recently bought this for my Droid Ultra and I wrote a nice review for it, so I am not sure why it's not showing. This cover fits perfectly and is the best cell phone cover I've had for a phone. It's not a hard plastic style, but also not one of those jelly like covers. It's very protective and adds hardly any size to the phone. just be sure to select the tab for the droid ultra where the available models are listed prior to adding to the shopping cart - Larry"
Can one still use the side keys with this cover?,"Yes, buttons are covered but you can still use them."
How thick is it compared to the phone?,"It rises about 2mm above the front edges, and adds about 2mm to the back. It takes my Droid Maxx from about 1/4"" to about 3/8"" thick. It doesn't add much, but it does protect the phone. I've had mine for several months and love it. And it's priced right."
Will it slide around the dashboard or armrest of my truck?,For the most part no. It keeps the phone from sliding on your seat or dashboard.
Has anyone dropped their phone with this case on? Does it protect the screen from cracking?,"I've dropped my phone with this case on and my screen hasn't cracked. However, I may have just been lucky. This case doesn't have a protector over the screen, so it depends on what type of surface you drop your phone on."
Is a motorola Droid Ultra the same as the XT1080?,"Yes, they are the same model (Droid Ultra XT1080)."

How many come in the pack?,10
Does this fit the new Nextbook 8 NX008HD8G tablet sold by walmart,"Yeah it does; that is the same kind of tablet I have, also bought from Wal*Mart. :)"
I'm confused. If it is a lifetime warranty-then why would you put 3 in a pack if I would only need one?,If one does not work or fit properly try another and so on. I tried all 3 and none of the 3 fit properly.
does this fit the sprint model ok??,"Yes, I got my G2 from sprint and it has the appropriate cut outs. The screen is too short to fit the phone edge to edge, but it covers about 98% of the phone, and 100% of the light up part of the screen."
Does this protector account for the curved edges of the Model LG-D801 from T-Mobile? I have tried 3 other protectors and they all peel up.,They have so far. I use the Ballistic case for mine. Maybe the rubber corners help hold it down. Hope this helps you.

We just bought two LG G2 phones from Sprint. Will these fit the screen and work with the Cruzerlite Bugdroid Circuit Case? Sprint's didn't.,"It should fit.

Will this work with ios 7 on an iphone 5 ? I have a case now that says its not compatible and will not charge wish i could downgrade from ios 7,"It works great with any iOS device and any version, you just have to know how. Once you plug in the charging cable to the phone (battery pack) push the on button on the battery pack, you will see the phone charging and the first light (light) on the battery pack on without blinking. Once the phone is fully charged, the first light (led) will sart to flash and then the other 3 until all 4 are on without blinking. You will notice that in the morning the phone is at about 97 to 95% of charge, this is normal due the time that has elapsed from when the phone stoped charging the battery and switched over to the battery pack. When you see that the battery of the phone is almost drained, just push the on button on the battery pack and the battery pack will start charging your phone. The blue lights (leds) will start flashing 4,3,2,1 off. Your phone should be fully charged and the battery pack empty"

"I've owned this speaker for 2 months, and it worked great until last night when it began to emit a low static-y sound. Anyone else have this problem?",I have not experienced this problem in owning mine for a year ... Might be due to it being low on power and needing a recharge

Anyone use this for phone calls? How well does it work?,It works very well for phone calls. I even used it for a call in my car
Can this speaker be continually plugged in or does that ruin the battery life?,"It is OK to keep it continuously plugged in. When the Cyren is off and fully charged and USB connected to 5.14V, it draws 0.00 Amps (I have a USB volt-amp meter). The battery is being charged only when it needs to be charged, and that is good for the battery."
"My ph-BT1000 can't pair with my Ipad Air nor my laptop. It paired with my Iphone OK, is there any updates or patches that can improve discoverability?","It is likely still paired with your IPhone. Once the speaker is paired with a device it remains paired to that device. Turn Bluetooth off on your IPhone and put the speaker back into pairing mode (power down, wait 10secs and power back on). You will know it is in pairing mode when it flashes Red and Blue. Keep in mind the speaker will automatically pair with any previously paired device thereby blocking any other new device pairings."
12 volt re-charge?,It's a 5-v USB-powered device...So any 5-v USB power adapter or USB hub or computer port will power and charge the speaker.
"Since this does not come with a charger, is there a recommended max Amperage to charge this with?","I have a USB volt-amp meter. When the Cyren is off and USB connected and charging, the USB is at 5.11V and the Cyren is drawing 580 mA. A computer USB port must source at least 500 mA. So, if you have a dedicated USB power source that supplies more than 500 mA, like 1 Amp or 2 Amp, it would charge the Cyren a little faster, but not much faster."
Which is better this Cyren speaker or The OontZ Angle Ultra-Portable Wireless Bluetooth Speaker?,"I had the same question. Thanks for bringing this up. I studied internet to find this answer for two days. And this is what I find: 1. Cyren is slightly richer in bass than Oontz Angle 2. Cyren is better looking, though some people like the way angle points upwards towards listeners when you place it on a table (waist height). But I like the simple look of Cyren better ... goes well with my book-rack 3. In one of the you tube review I can see Cyren has two speakers 40mm diameter and probably a central woofer (I am not sure). I definitely see an impression of speaker diaphram in center ... I am not sure if Oontz has that. 4. A number of websit, including http://www.bestwirelessspeakersreview.com/reviews/ constantly top-rated Cyren ... compared to Oontz 5. By looking at the picture I felt Oontz ... toy like with a flashy LED... and many complain low-bass. I felt Cyren was more serious shaped and people say it has slightly more bass and power than Oontz. 6. Number of reviews 1800 for Cyren and 1200+ for Oontz .......both average 4.5 in Amazon ...... onbiously more people trust Cyren. That may be due to earlier release date of Cyren. But I believe in peoples' trust ... the more the number of rating the more its time tested. 7. If price speaks of quality ... then note you are getting around 70% discount on 120 USD speaker (Cyren), where as around 43% discount on 70% speaker (Oontz Angle) ...... Waiting for it to arrive. Will know for sure once I ear it."
"Wondering how this works with a Samsung Galaxy S3? Phone has bluetooth but I have never purchased wireless speakers. Using mainly for music, pandora..",Works great....pairs easily. ....that is the phone I have
"I bought the cyren speaker to use with my Samsung S4 phone. The sound is very choppy, not really useable, fine with earbuds. Any help?","When choppy with my HTC phone, this works: Turn the Cyren off, wait two seconds, and turn it back on. After a few seconds the Cyren and the HTC pair automatically and the choppy goes away. BTW, since this happens with my other Bluetooth speakers, I think it is a phone problem, not a Cyren problem."
"Will it work well over a small group of people's voices, say in a basement?","Yes, it will definitely be able to handle that type of environment. It is not going to be as loud as a larger speaker, but is great for having as background music with a group of people (even a large group)."
Will this work with an mp3 player that isn't bluetooth?,"Yes, there is an auxiliary input that uses a standard 3.5mm headphone jack."
To anybody that has had both the Cyren and the Oontz... Wich is better in sound???,"Cyren, even inside the bag that it comes with its crisp and clear...sound gets very loud also"

Does this case fit the Cosmos 2?,Yes it does. Very well.
why does this need a stylus if the phones not touch screen?,A stylus can be used since the buttons are small but a stylus is not required.

does it fit the lg cosmos 3 perfectly?,Yes it does. My daughter has not had any issues with this case.

It Does fit with cd player of toyota corolla 2009? Is compatible with Samsung S3 Mini?,"Hi Victoriano - Yes to both. The Toyota Corolla center media dash has a slightly wide angle somewhere between 90 and 120 degrees which is compatible with this mount. In terms of views, the mount can be adjusted to accommodate 360 movement, side to side placement for full driver and passenger views as well as vertical tilt positioning. The stock CD drive itself is also compatible with the mount wedge inserts. The Samsung S3 Mini is 63mm or 2.48 inches wide and approx .4 inches deep which will fit comfortably in the mount. Thanks! Cost Brothers"
Will it work with a garmin nuvi 5 inch,"I have a Garmin Nuvi 200 and it fits fine. When the holder closes to fit a device it closes ""evenly"" which makes it a little difficult if using the charger BUT ONLY BECAUSE you need to remove the Garmin from the holder and plug charger up & then place it back in the holder. It was easier for me to remove the holder from the CD slot and reinsert it after the charger/Garmin were in place. All done in less than 1 minute. I would recommend this definitely...."
"Can this be mounted upside down? As in, the phone extends downwards from the CD slot, rather than up as seen in the picture.",Yes it can. It swivels 360
After using this for a while my CD player has broken. Did anyone else have this problem and if so is there a solution?,"This has not happened with either mount that we have purchased. It may be due to over tightening of the CD inset itself. Make sure it is snug, but do not exert additional force for set-up."
Can you play cd,"I'm guessing you're referring to the cd player still working with this on. I don't know for sure as my cd player is busted which lead me to purchasing this. With that being said, it takes less than a minute to remove this if need be."
Will this work with a multi disk CD player?,Yes it should work just fine. I use it in a multi-disk player myself. I would just make sure to eject/insert any CDs prior to installing the mount. If you eject while the mount is installed you could damage your player.
"Will this securely hold a Garmin nuvi 2555 LMT 5"" gps at 6.9 oz?",Yes it will. There are 2 different adjustment screws to tighten and adjust the position.
Will it work with a garmin nuvi 5 inch,"Depending on the dimensions of the Garmin, it should fit. The unit will expand to about 4.5"" (11.4cm) and reduce to 2"" (5cm). What you would have to do is place the Garmin in lengthwise (at its skinniest) and rotate the mount to view horizontally."
does it fit a nokia lumia 1520,Yes

Does 16000 or 20800 have AC adapter??","for my 16000's, it didnt come with an adapter to charge it. it just says to use a mirco usb input to charge it. also be aware of charging. i notice the one i gave to my friend he kept charging it every day and his batteries capacity is decreasing. so make sure you drain it all the way to one bar (not completely dead before charging) mine is fine cause i only charge it when it gets to one bar..... otherwise great product. also dont interrupt it when its charging. my friend did that. wait till it fully charges!"
"I would be traveling to India,where output voltage is 220v .would this product work.",Considering that it only charges by usb. I'm assuming it will charge anything that takes usb. Just make sure you charge the backup in the states before you leave.
Is this capable of charging at USB 3.0 speed?,"The speed of charging depends on your cable. It doesn't come with 3.0 cable, but if you have one then you'd be able to."
How long does it take for it to recharge. I find it absurd that I got one solid blue light after 5 hours of charge. Why is it slow that slow.,Depends what you're charging from and what kind of power output it has. Remember this is 13000mAh. It's a large battery. If you're charging from the wall try a different wall connector. If you're charging USB you have to consider the amp output of that port. And if you're using solar power you gotta consider output of that as well.
"I got X4 13000mAh version, I charges my iPhone 5 and iPad mini, many times it stoped charging at 95-97% level. Is it considered normal or defective?",This works better than anything I have tired before. You won't regret buying it. Go for it......
How long does it take to recharge using the ACpower adapter and USB cord that comes with? I've completely discharged it and this is my first recharge.,"No more than 5 hours, I recharged overnight"
Can I charge this from a USB connector or only AC? I want to connect it to my solar panel USB out.,yeah. i charge mine from my car or my laptop sometimes.

Where do I get the DC 1volt wall charger for this battery pack?,"It works with almost all standard wall chargers for mobile phones, tablets, etc"

Several questions but have to ask separately due to character limits! Can you charge a device or devices from the USB ports while the battery pack is charging?,"I use it to charge my iphone from the 1.0A port all the time and it works fine, but it probably wouldn't work as well with the 2.1A port since charging input is only 1.0A"
I purchased this product from you in July and now it won't take a charge. What should I do?,Return the device for a full refund or replacement
Can this device be left plugged in to a charger all the time? I would only expect to use it in emergencies. How long will it keep a full charge?,"I use it for my cell and tablet and it stays charged for about 3 days to a week depending on use. As for keeping it plugged in, i would for safety just charge it and turn it off. If its not in use, it turns off to not burn the battery out. It is well worth the money. Mine has paid for itself more then once"

How many hours does it take to charge the POWERADD device after it is completely drained?,"That really depends on the output of your charger.

Is this phone prepaid or postpaid? Thanks!,"Hey Shelly! This is a prepaid Verizon Phone. The seller SweetUSdeals posted this item last week and the pictures and lower description are correct. for some reason amazon just added a description for the LG Extravert, not sure why. just keep that in mind if you are going to buy. Another thing is that this phone is good for ""Only New Prepaid contract will work for this phone. Cannot be used as a replacement for active contract or line."" hope this info helped Tyler"
can i use this phone on my verizon family plan to replace my broken lg phone,"Yes, but there are two versions of this phone-one that works on regular verizon accounts the other that says it is a prepaid phone. Be very sure not to get the one that is prepaid as I did first. (and it was listed in the very last line of the detailed description lower on the page!) The right one works great."
Is this a regular phone ? or id it a smart phone? I'm looking for a regular phone.,"The LG Cosmos 3 is a regular phone, meaning it is not a smart phone. It has the full keypad, which is handy to send text. There is a calendar option as a reminder of appointments. It fits the bill as a basic phone."
Is this phone for the pay as you go prepaid accounts. And will Verizon stores help transfer your info and remaining money over to this phone.,I opened a new prepaid account with Verizon and cancelled my old provider. I went to a Verizon store and they took care of transferring all my contacts and other info.
"I have a prepaid phone now from Verizon, It's a very old plan, I pay $16.70 each month for my phone, Can I use this phone under the same plan?",Be careful dealing with Verizon all phone company's will do every thing possible to kill your plan so you pay more . But I think this phone is great and if you by your own phone your plan being prepaid should stay the same . This phone i was unable to use it for the fact is it a prepaid and I have a family plan and they would not let me us it so I bought the same phone for my plan and then my contract stays the same . Do your self a favor and stop by a Verizon store and ask if your phone being changed would affect your monthly payment ? Better safe than sorry

what is a good sturdy case for this phone.there are so many to choose from,I got one of the MPERO SNAPZ series rubberized cases. I've dropped and kicked my phone with it on and it protects very nicely.
If I buy this phone can I use it with my already plan?,I bought this phone and when i took it to verizon they said it couldnt be added to our plan because its a pre-paid phone. I was pissed. Nowhere in the ad did it say it was a pre-paid phone. Wasted my time and money.
Can we use this phone with the current number we already have on a lost phone with our Verizon plan?,"No, this is a prepaid phone, and it has to be activated for 6 months before it can be used on a contract line."
"I am looking for the LG Cosmos 3 which you show as ""NEW"" on your page but the pic is of a used one. Can you tell me if it is new and in original pk,",Yes

Is the camera really 13 megapixel?,"The new HTC One will be the first to feature the HTC UltraPixel Camera - an advanced imaging technology that offers a great leap in the quality of point-and-shoot photos and video. Smartphones have rapidly become the primary camera for millions of people, and taking pictures has become an indispensable part of daily life. HTC is committed to offering the highest quality camera available, so even everyday pictures are gratifying and memorable. With our new camera, you'll be able to quickly shoot vivid, true-to-life images with a wide range of colors, even in low light conditions. We accomplish this not by increasing the number of megapixels in the camera, but by engineering a more advanced CMOS Sensor, ISP, and optical lens system that captures significantly more light than most 8 or 13 megapixel cameras. ""We shouldn't scrap pixel count entirely when weighing smartphone cameras, but in terms of the hardware and software details that actually go into making a great photo, megapixels are highly overrated. It's high time we focus on other areas that count more, like that undersung sensor. Jessica Dolcourt, CNET May 12, 2012 In this section we will describe for you how we've created the most sensitive smartphone camera, which include these key components of ImageSense technology: UltraPixel Sensor - Engineered with larger pixels, it enables each pixel to capture more than 300% more light than most leading 13 megapixel cameras. HTC ImageChip - Offers continuous autofocus, color shading, and noise reduction, as well as more realistic High Dynamic Range. F/2.0 Aperture - The largest available smartphone camera aperture, it lets in 44% more light than the iPhone 5. Optical Image Stabilization - Drastically reduces blur in still photos and shaky video footage."

I stay in an apartment. Can I just don't use the Outdoor monitor and still use the weather station ?,Yes you can no problem

Can I use outside this inside unit???,The outside unit has special sealing to protect against damage from moisture plus has also a wall fitting. The indoor unit cannot be easily exchanged with an outdoor one.
If I add an additional indoor module....can I monitor co2 in the room ? does this just work like the base indoor module and provide all those details?,The add-on indoor modules have their own individual CO2 sensors
Do i have to buy the whole weather system or can i just buy the indoor ones ?,"You have to buy the indoor ""base station"" which comes with a single outdoor station. Only then can you add additional modules."
Will the indoor unit operate on its own without purchasing the Weather Station kit that includes the outdoor unit? I only need indoor units.,"No. The indoor units are additional, secondary transmitters that talk to the primary indoor unit provided in the Weather Station kit. The primary unit is needed to report the information over the Internet. The secondary units cannot do this."

Does it fit i 9515 L ?,Doesn't work
Is this the digitizer with the screen attached,Yes it is
DOes it come with everything you need to replace the LCD digitizer yourself?,"You will probably need precision size Torx and phillips screwdrivers. These can be picked up at harbor freight or amazon for a few dollars. You shouldn't need adhesive, but there are some components held in place by adhesive that would need to be removed with a small plastic pry tool."
works on i9500 devices?,"I have a i9505 and It work perfectly, I don't see any ware in the notes / description section that this will work for your model."
does it come with the middle plate?,"Yes. Once you pop the old assembly off there is very little to move to the new assembly. Then you just snap it back together, replace screws and it's as good as new."

"I know this isn't OEM, but what's the difference between OEM and this one? Like what are the differences between OEM and this generic one?",I have used this replacement part for over 6 months with no difference from the part that originally came with the phone. Whether it is OEM or generic does not matter because it has function flawlessly since it was installed.
"First, is this OEM Samsung? And second, does this LCD Assembly include the Digitizer?",It includes the digitizer and the amoled screen both. Personally I don't think the build quality was Samsung OEM but its definitely a fair product.
Does it matter what provider you have? Im in Canada on Fido and the phone is i337,I dont think provider would matter. As long as the phone is GSM. This is for Samsung Galaxy S4 for me it worked flawlessly and looks like oem. Good luck!

"Is there a way to get it to reconnect to the bluetooth device after it dies without turning it off and on again? (the switch on mine seems to have broken, and I don't want to throw it away because the sound is too good!)",You'd have to reconnect it through the phone but mine usually reconnects after being dead.
Can I leave it on all the time so I don't have to manually turn it on to pair it? Will it go to sleep?,"The battery lasts around 4-8 hours on full charge so you can leave it on till it dies, I don't believe it goes to sleep if inactive."
"how good does this work with a cell phone, ( samsung galaxy stellar i200?) i need a loud ringer and speaker to hear the phone ring and the caller.","The speaker volume matches my phone's ringer volume. If I have the speaker on in my home office and my phone is on the other side of the house I will hear one or the other where ever I am. If my phone is in the same room as the speaker I hear the ringer in stereo, but not any louder than either device on its own. I have an iPhone 4S."
Do you have to turn the unit on to charge via USB? That's what's happening with mine. TIA,"Not in my experience. The device seems to charge just fine while off or on, even while actively playing music. I have never been able to run the battery long enough to go completely dead so I don't know if that is the case with a totally dead battery."
"I see that one of the features lists ""new"" bluetooth v3.0, is the correct? Newest bluetooth standard is V4 so a little confusing.","In the manual that it came with it says it is ""Bluetooth compliant: V3.0"""

"Will this case accommodate a Galaxy Note 3 with a slim case, my Note 3 with case measures 6.12 x 3.25 inches which is almost at the limit... i'm wondering if anyone has actually tried it and if the case would close with the phone in it","My old Motorola in an Otter Box case measures 5 1/2"" by 3"" by 1/2"" thick and it is a tight fit. The RideMate gives full functionality to my phone even with a very snug fit. There may be a little length available because of the generous closure flap. I hope this helps. Tim"
"How does the bag attach to the handlebar clamp? Also, you put the phone in the bag and then the end folds over and closes with velcro?",There is a clip on the back side of the protective sleeve that slides into the handle bar mount.

Are the waterproof version and non-waterproof version the same size and do they both allow headphones?,"I only have the waterproof version so I can't respond to your question about sizing. In regards to your question about headphones you could use headphones and still be weatherproof but not water tight. In order to be water tight you need to seal the closure (like a zip lock bag) before you fold over and velcro the top flap over the closure. In order to use headphones with a cord you wouldn't be able to fully seal the zip lock closure and therefore would not be water tight. Having said this, however, I still believe that your equipment would be protected from the elements because the velcro flap folds over that closure. Since the closure and velcro flap are located on the top your equipment would almost certainly be protected if you used the mount in its vertical position. If you used it horizontally you might increase the chances of moisture getting in but you would really need a driving rain in order to do so. Also, you should be able to route your cord so it exits on a corner and you would then be able to mostly seal the zip lock, too, thereby increasing it's weather resistance."
what is the dimensions of the bag?,"4"" wide by 6"" tall. Those are exterior dimensions."
Can you fit an iPhone 6 (standard) with headphones plugged in? Is it convenient to have the headphone cable trailing out of the opening?,I use a galaxy 5 which I think is about the size of the iPhone 6 I have a rubber case on it and it fits fine having the cord out is not an issue at all the biggest issue was where to mount it I have comfort bars on my road bike and it was a little difficult to find a spot but when I did it worked great.
Will it fit the iPhone 6 Plus with an Apple leather case?,No. I don't believe it will fit the iPhone 6 plus! Sorry
"The clamp's jaws are shut, how do you get it open? I tried opening the clamp but it doesn't move apart... just more pressure? don't want to break it","Yes, sometimes it feels like it will break. Just put more force.. the material is really strong."
Is it necessary to use the clamp strip?,Yes if you want to hold the item in place as that is what grips the handlebar. It is a nice item. Velcro is heavy duty so phone doesn fall

not really understand . is factory unlocked ? or coming for a particular operator ?,No clue. If you're getting one keep and eye on the battery and temp of the phone. It gets awfully hot very fast
Is this phone unlocked can I use it on Page plus ?,"Since page plus is through verizon, you should be able to without much difficulty, but to be safe, I would call and ask them first. This phone comes basically factory unlocked, you can Google people using it on stright talk, and I know it works on cricket (although I don't know about the 4g capabilities being able to be used on other networks). They may try to charge you anyways, most companies will try, even though this specific phone shouldn't be a problem, corporations love their money.

Will this stop charging once the phone is fully charged,"I'm really not sure. From what I understand from previous information on charges, is they will continue to trickle / slow charge after the rapid charge cycle is complete. After the battery is completely full to capacity, it will no longer take a charge. This may vary from types of battery cells. The best I can do is to direct you to your cell phone service manual or contact your cell phone tech support. Sorry I could not give you a definitive answer."

Do you have to remove it from the vent every time you want to mount your phone?,"No... I dont. But you might be aware that it does not fit to EVERY kind of vent. Mine, for instance, is a Nissan Livina... it fits but does not fit hard... it still a kind of dropping..."
Is this safe to use even if I have the A/C or heat on in my car?,"I thought about that before I got it, but A/C won't hurt your phone. When the heat is on in my car it usually vents out of the bottom by my feet. The only time I wouldn't use it is if I had the defroster on, when heat comes out of the vents at the top where the phone would be mounted. I think the product is worth it, and that was a good question!"
"I use my phone as a GPS and to take pictures for my job, so it will have to come in and out of the clip 50+ times a day. Will it stand up to abuse?",Well that sounds like heaven use and while it is sturdy it will eventually wear our. But Andrew here are 2 positives for you: 1. It's not too expensive. 2.

If fact nothing holds it closed. It is just basically a wallet with a plastic holder for the phone. I can carry my cash and cards.
"judging by the pictures above, the camera cut outs do not match the layout of the Galaxy Note2. I need to be sure this will fit before purchasing. Will the actual case match all of the cutouts of the note 2?",It fits just perfect! I love this case. Plenty of room and protection for my Note II signed very happy consumer!

"are the volume buttons and power switch covered? also, what is the difference between this case and the slim armor s?","The volume and power button are covered by very smooth and responsive buttons. The buttons push as if they are a part of the device with, completely natural. The slim armor is a thin rigid skin type case. It is open on the top and bottom but still provides a lot of protection. This case was dropped and provided better protection then I ever imagined. The back plate is made from a very beautiful brushed aluminum piece. The slim armor is the closest thing to a raw no case feel you can get with a lot of protection. You would be happy with either case. I use the neo hybrid for work and out about trips and the slim armor at home and running errands."
Does the case block the flash? Do pictures come out obscured by the flash due to the case in dark situations?,"Case does not block the flash, dont worry man! I've taken many photos/videos with no issues. I love mine and recommend it."
will a tempered glass screen protector fit inside this case?,I have an uppercase tempered glass screen protector and it fits perfect. I got the glass perfectly centered so it had the best chance of fitting and it fits with no issues
I remove my case several times per week to put it in my armband when I work out. Is this case going to hold up?,"I remove my phone from my case once a month. and it's held up for me. but removing it several times a week would probably increase the probability of it loosening and not holding up but it all depends how careful you are when removing. but the case is great while it's on the phone, very durable. hope this helps!"
What are the exact dimensions of this case?,"I can't find the exact dimensions on the site but I took a ruler and measured it myself...5.75in x 2.75in x 1cm (figured this as a cm would be better than the decimal in inches). It really only adds an extra millimeter it seems on each side, it's very slim/little."
"Since the ""bumper"" that goes over the TPU portion is very delicate, does spigen sell replacement bumpers and if so how much and whats the web site","I found the frame piece available on Amazon (I personally am getting a second color, just so I can change up every now and then). Here is the link: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FLFSXLC/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_S_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid=PYRONJH6B5C2&coliid=I2RET1SRWTAU7Z"
Can it be used without the bumper? Will the buttons be accessible?,"Yes, the buttons are accessible without the bumper, but you will want to use it. The bumper makes little to no difference in the dimensions of the case itself and looks good on it."
"I have dropped my phone a couple of times, will this case protect against this.","This case has sort of a cushion inside and around the edges inside of it so it will be well protected as long as you don't drop it from an extreme height or a strong force. The screen sits slightly below the edges of the case so if you were to drop it face down it is not going to break easily. I've had it for a month+ and i absolutely love it. It is not bulky or heavy. In fact, i get completed by people all the time because of the sleek seamless look/feel of the case. I will definitely buy another one again!"
I bought a different case and the edge around the screen was so tight that it would rip the screen protector film. Does this case do that?,"Looking at it, the case does not cover the front of my glass screen at all. Only the metal edge. If the screen cover does not go past the beveled edge of the glass, it should not interfere at all I would guess."
Will the Bose In-Ear headphone jack fit with this case?,Im not sure of the size of the bose headphone jack but to give you an idea i bought a 3.5 mm rocket fish aux and it fits well:)
is a tempered screen protector gonna fit?,I use an Anker tempered glass screen protector which fits without any issue....
I want to know if you think this is as protective a case as an Otterbox Defender or Lifeproof Fre',"No, not quite. It doesn't feature a front protector for the glass."
is there a bumper around the screen,The bumper is really flimsy part! Its a two part case. First goes the rubber part that wraps around like a normal case then u put on the bumper. There is a place where the bumper fits in and the only part close to screen will be the lip from the rubber case. Once the bumper is on the case it looks awesome and helps pressing the buttons. I think there is also reviews on youtube.
"How well can this case protect the screen? If it's not well, can we use a screen protector along with this case?","The case does have a small lip (1 or 2mm) that has effectively protected the screen when I have dropped my phone in the past. This case would work well with most screen protectors, however I do not feel the need to use one."
I understand the bumper is plastic. Does it scratch easily? Wondering how it looks after a few months? Thanks!,"No, it doesn't"
Will this fit iPhone 5c?,No. I dont think it would fit perfectly on the 5c but I do think that this same company has a case just for the 5c's.

How easy is this case to get on and off? (I use an armband case for running),"It's not extremely difficult, but the case fits on pretty tight. I would think that the bumper portion will hold up since it is now made of aluminum."
1. Does the 'AmazonBasics Apple Certified Lightning to USB Cable' fit when the case is on? 2. What about an AUX cable?,For your first question you should have no issues the case provides more than enough room for the lightning cable and as well as AUX they both have enough room with more than enough protection.
Do you guys provide free home buttons sticker?,I'm not the seller so I don't have an answer for your question
Can you purchase multiple color metal bumpers without having to buy it fully with the TPU?,"I would add that the bumper isn't metal, it's plastic, or ""thermoplastic polyeurethane"" to be exact. It doesn't detract and it actually makes it easier to install. Just want you to know what you're getting."
Will the case interfere with a screen protector?,"Absolutely doesn't, it's right around the corners of the phone so no problem there."
does it have a belt clip?,No
how is it for drop protection,"Poor, the case looks nice but won't offer much protection."
does it have a lip that goes over the front of the phone a little bit to protect from front side drops,Yes
Will the finger print unlock feature on the iPhone5s still work with this case?,Yes it doesn't interfere with the fingerprint feature
Does this case give the same drop protection as the Spigen tough armor?,"This case fit perfect, and give drop protection; I don't know if is similar to spigrn tough armor! I recomend it"
I lost the power button on this case. Does anyone know where I can get replacement parts?,Talk to the company. Mine popped out during installation because I didn't follow the directions like they said. But now it's in there and been fine for months.
Does the case get scratches easily like the slim armor?,I've never had the slim armor.. but so far so good.
"Did anyone have any troubles connecting their headphones to the audio output jack through the case? If so, what kind of headphones were you using?",No

Can I monitor video with my D7000 with this cable?,"I can with my Canon 60D. Full control of photos and video. I even bought the mount so it sits above my camera like those $500 monitors! I would hate to tell you it works with the D7000 if it doesn't, but it SHOULD. Find a program in the app store and make sure it's compatible (the phone software) with the D7000. Sorry I'm not too much help. Good luck!"
Will this work with an iPad mini or a iPhone 5?,No
Would this work with an iphone 5s?,No this has a USB and a micro USB end. You need a USB to lightning end.
Can you tell me will this cable allow me to transfer from my canon rebel to kindle hd?,"yes,it works with phone (s3) and nikon"

is it chargeable?,Yes it is.
Does this phone come with like 10 FREE MINUTES upon activation?,Not at all
"How do you change the menu color? On the brightness menu, you can see the colors down below, but I can't click any of them.","i think what you want to do is go to settings, display, graphic, preloaded, that will give you backgrounds, or you can take a picture and use as your background"
I looked at the Virgin Mobile web site at the Paylo plans. The cheapest one is $20/month - NOT pay as you go??

Does the case come with a screen protector?,No it doesn't.
"does it have a lip to that the screen has a barrier when dropped , if so how big is the lip?",Yes it does. The case is a two part case. It has a rubberized inner shell that just comes up over the phone and then you put the outer case over top of that. The outer case also has a bit of a lip. I don't see you you could damage the screen when dropping the phone with this cover on it unless it falls against corner of an object.
"When they say lifetime warranty, does that just cover the case or the phone too? Is there a cover that guarantees protection for an iphone 5c?",Just the case. Check with your cell phone provider for insurance you can add to your monthly bill that covers the phone.
does this really have a lifetime warranty? Or is there fine print?,I did not care much for the guarantee because I live outside the US. If I can say that we must be very sensitive because it gets dirty easily and is not easy to clean (if not impossible).
Will this case protect the screen? Thanks.,The case doesn't provide protection for the screen but it does tuck the phone in a little bit for face down falls...if that makes sense.
Can you give us an idea of how long it would take to deliver this item once we place an order?,"Hello. The shipments are made by Amazon, not by Luvvitt.

"I know that the Boost Mobile Galaxy S2 has mobile hotspot capabilities, but does the Galaxy S3 have Built-in mobile hotspot functionality?","S2 only has hotspot capabilities IF you already own it AND the phone is in service. My fiance has an S2, lost it and sent for new one from insurance. In mean time he bought the S3 because he needs a phone for his business. He planned on giving me the new phone when his came insurance. Because he switched his service from the S2 to the S3 for less than a week, he lost his hotspot capabilities and only can get that back if he pays $10 a month. So beware, if you happen to buy an S2 phone, you will not get hotspot unless you pay for it."

"if i purchase this phone, can i chose my carrier or do i have to go with Boost!","Hi, if it specifically states ""Boost Mobile"", it can only be used with Boost Mobile!!!

"I know that the Boost Mobile Galaxy S2 has mobile hotspot capabilities, but does the Galaxy S3 have Built-in mobile hotspot functionality?","S2 only has hotspot capabilities IF you already own it AND the phone is in service. My fiance has an S2, lost it and sent for new one from insurance. In mean time he bought the S3 because he needs a phone for his business. He planned on giving me the new phone when his came insurance. Because he switched his service from the S2 to the S3 for less than a week, he lost his hotspot capabilities and only can get that back if he pays $10 a month. So beware, if you happen to buy an S2 phone, you will not get hotspot unless you pay for it."

"Is the backside of this item neoprene, and does it look the seams will stay sewn/ hold up? Also want to know if you can press side buttons easily.","The side button press is ""okay"" at best, sometimes I have to push in a few times to find where the buttons are. As for the neoprene, it goes the entire way around on the back of the main section as well as the straps. The strap is actually where I have the biggest problem for this item. I have had it for about 2 months, and use it roughly 3-4 times per week at Planet Fitness using their machines and free-weights. I am 6'1"" and 180 lbs, looking to add muscle, but am not overly muscular currently. After this moderate use over the last 2 months I have recently had to stop using this product as the velcro no longer stays attached. The ""loop"" side of the hook-and-loop has become significantly frayed and won't stay attached. The only way it would work would be for me to sew on new loop material or to move it to a thicker part of my arm to change where the velcro attaches to itself. Although I am disappointed in this products life-span I guess at the price point I got what I paid for."
Will the phone fit if it has a case on it?,"Yes. It required a small cut to extend the opening, but yes, it fits!"
It looks like a very tight fit. Will the phone keep getting turned off and on?,It was perfect for for me. The phone never turns off.
"Can you plug in headphones, or does the case block the jack?","Yes, there is a long slit at the top where the phone slides in. It is open so nothing blocks the headphone jack."
What are the dimensions of the battery - it looks smaller than mine.,"The battery measures 2 2/8""by 2 1/2"" and was the exact size and as the original in my Galaxy S4. It is as advertised Samsung Original OEM and I have been using it since arrival and it is holding charge well. Hope this helps with your assessment of this replacement."
Can anybody who had this shipped and sold by Amazon attest to the products authenticity?,"Worst. Battery. EVER! Mine lasted two months before they overheated and would not hold a charge. Two batteries in two separate phones, so I know was the battery and not a phone issue."
will it work with the veizon i545 s4 ?,Yes sir. That is the model I have it installed in.
Does this battery actually indiate that the cell is made in Japan as actual OEM batteries do? Pictures provided are conflicting?,They have more than manufacturing plant Korea Japan China Vietnam etc they are license by Samsung yes the are OEM

I copied my contacts from my old phone to my 520 using a Micro SD card. I did need to do some minor editing to some names that copied over given the different format in the address books."

Is this a lifeproof brand?,"No I'm pretty sure it's a generic brand, but I have had a few friends use them and they work great."
does water get into the case? will it mess my phone up?,I never even tried to deep my phone in the water because the material of the case was so cheap that I was almost sure that it wouldn't be sealed enough to keep the water out of the case. The main problem with this case (TRUST ME) is that the screen protector plastic is not flat enough so you won't be able to make good contact with your phone's screen when you touch it. It was annoying!

does it wear out fast,I only had it on for two days because I didn't like it
Does the cover extend onto the front of the case to protect the front screen?,Nope
Is the case snap-on case?,"Yes, covers back and both sides"
Does the cover extend onto the front of the case to protect the front screen?I,No nothing on the screen. It just protects the bottom and the sides.
is there a rubber that surrounds the phone or is it plastic?,NO rubber! Just plastic. :( That is why it isn't protective!
Does the cover extend onto the front of the case to protect the front screen?I,No I regret buying this very very cheap
How can you tell when the battery is charged? Are there any lights that let you know?,"Yes, there is a light that changes from purple to light blue when the battery is charged."

is this adhesive the clear adhesive that covers the touch part of screen or is it black for the border?,"It is only the adhesive for the back of the border between the phone and the glass. I just used it to fix my broken screen today. I peeled the bottom side off, aligned and placed it on the phone. Peeled the top off. Then placed the glass on. Pretty easy!"
I have replaced the front glass once already. I need a new replacement glass for the Galaxy s4 and I purchased a pro kit before what would I need now?,"I am no expert, but you would need the tools required to pull the glass, clean the LCD surface, then the special UV Loca glue (really messy stuff), then apply the prokit for a nice fit, rub out air bubbles, then place in direct sunlight for 30-60 min to harden the Loca glue, wipe things down and you are good to go. Many youtube videos out there showing how the process is completed. Good luck."

Make sure that the old glue or adhesive is completely gone before applying the new screen. As far as the plastic film I dont remember exactly but I would say after it is applied so you dont scratch it.
Is this the adhesive to adhere a new glass to the digitizer? Is it better to just use the strips?,"It's a perfect fit, easy to use. However I've used the 3M 2mm Roll and cut to fit.more challenging but it works too."
I assume the sticky side goes on the LCD then I pull the film off and place the screen on and heat to no more than 200 degrees F. Is that correct?,I found that this was really not needed to fix the phone. The old adhesive was still there at worked fine.
Is this project standard model or extended model?,Its the standard model. You can tell from the photos the difference between the extended and regular by the proportion of the RED to the SILVER (regular is 1:1; extended is 1:2). Hope that helps
Does this fit with most cases? I also heard there may be a separate version that is designed for iPhones in cases.,"I bough the standard one and, whilst it fits in off position with my proporta slim case, it will not allow it to turn clockwise to the on position because of the small lug sticking out. It will turn anti clockwise but, as my iPin doesn't work, I can't verify if this 'alternative-on-position' will work the device. Hope that helps."
does it work with android devices?,Yes it will work with Android but not with windows phones
Will the laser stay on while using other apps?,Not with the default software. But the ipin-supplied software does have some features for remote control of Powerpoint or Keynote.
Will this work for the Iphone6/6+?,"No Tried on a 6+, wouldn't be recognized by the app"
"hi, does this model work for android phone both the beam and the app to flip powerpoint presentations? btw, i m using nexus 5. thanks!",No
Will this work with my Samsung Galaxy S4? Or is it strictly iPhones?,"Hello, I can confirm that it defiantly works on iPhones. And, based on the way that it looks it functions, I would say that it is possible for it to work on the s4, HOWEVER, the device will not work without the iPin app, if you can find that on your phone there shouldn't be a problem."
Does the laser stay on until you tap it again to turn it off or do you have to hold it continuously?,You have to hold it continuously
does it work with iPhone 6 normally?,"I'm pleased with it. You must have the app, and the iPin must be set properly, but it works well with my iPhone. The iPin is very small, though. I keep mine in a plastic bag with my book sales materials."
How to contact iPin customer service?,iPin official website has a Contact Us form.
Does it come with USB cable?,no
does this charhing dock fit the xperia z model number c6606?,I believe it is allowed to fit this model as well
works with sony z1 tablet?,No - it only works with one phone in particular: The Sony Xperia Z.
does it work with c6602,Yes
"Does this dock charge the phone, or does it just hold the phone?",It chargers your Sony and hold it as well.
Will my Sony Xperia Z Ultra Smartphone model C6806 fit? The other cradle is very loose and will not hold the very slim Xperia Ultra Z,I hv the same phone. It doesn't hold it to charge. It's piece of crap
My provider is T Mobile on the back of the phone Xperia C E 0682 model will this charger work also does it come with adaptors to plug in to car,"I don't think the charging cradle has any dependency on the provider you're using, so i think you should be good. as for the adaptors to plug in to cars, i haven't really used it in that way. i've primarily been using it on my desk connected to a wall plug charger, so i wouldn't really know if it works on the cars. but i figure if the voltage is enough, it should be ok."
Does it charge at the same speed as the regular charger?,Not quite.. But works great for me.
Does this dock support Xperia Z (c6603) with the case? Is the space between the groves sufficient to put the phone with a slim case?,No it doesn't.
"My phone has a Slim Spigen Glass.t screen protector, will it fit?",My phone has a clear skin as well. Fits fine.

I just bought an LG Optimus L70. Will this case fit this phone?,It did not fit my cell phone.
"I just purchased the LG Optimus G Pro. How do I tell if it's a 980, 840 or something else?",I do not know
Will this case fit the LG 840G?,No
will this fit the optimus g,"Okay it fits great, but if u have a protective plastic sheild on the face of your phone, the plastic from the wallet side will stick, easy fix, put clear nail polish over the wallet plastkc side, and the plastic wont stick.

I need it to fit a Lg optimus -(LS970) LG,It did not fit mine--I had to return it.
I have the LG OPtimus G 970. The phone in the pic looks a little different then mine...will this work for what I have?,"No, i dont think it will. With this folio case the inside back of the folio is hard plastic and your phone snaps inside very snuggly. So any other phone other than the Optimus G Pro E980 won't fit."
So it deff fits a LG T Moblie phone.?,It fits the lg optimus phone yes. And i love it.
Does it fit a LG t Mobile phone,"It fits my LG Optimus Pro. When you put the phone in case, it is hard to take out."

Does this hold Garmin n&uuml;vi 50LM 5-Inch Portable GPS Navigator?,To be honest...it does not work at all for anything. It even doesn't stick on dashboard. So far I am first time disappointed with Amazon with this product. My suggestion. ..do not buy
would it hold Samsung Galaxy S3 phone?,"I am not sure, but I would not waste my time with this product, unless, you have see and felt them yourself. Mine would not hold my GPS, nor my other two Samsung phones. The notch between was not cut wide enough to hold our thin phone up properly. My husband phone is thinner than mine and it fit but leaned so badly that the phone popped out within an hour. He tried several different times, with no luck. I hope this helps. May be good for holding change or something like that but for us it was a total waste of money and time. Good luck"
Will a phone with a cover still fit in the slot?,"I have an LG G2. It has a cover and it fits just fine in it. However, it is not an Otterbox or other thick cover, it's fairly slim."
what are the measurement.,"6x8 inches. I use it on my off-road dune buggy for my speedometer app, just velcrowed it to the dash, works great, really simple but serves the purpose perfectly"
does it make the phone stand up so you can see it while driving?,The mount tilts the phone backward slightly so as long as the dash is fairly level you should have no problem seeing it.
"If one's android (ZTE Savvy) isn't on the list of compatible phones, should one conclude that it isn't compatible?","I use it with my android, (maxx) works fine"
Does the button that answers and ends calls also mute the music?,I'm sorry.. I do not use the headphones for music.. just for the phone.
does it work with iPhone 5,"It should, however the headset stopped working a week after we received it so I can't check"
am I able to control the volume as you can in the earpods for the Iphone?,No. The button only answers and end calls.
can this stand hold the i phone with case on?,"Yes it can. However, it depends on the thickness of the case. I currently use a thin case, and it works fine. On the other hand, if you use an OtterBox Defender case for instance it won't work."
How wide is the area where the phone sits?,Product Dimensions: 4.1 x 3.2 x 0.9 inches ; 2.4 ounces The area where the phone sits is the 3.2 inches.
Will it hold the Galaxy S5?,It holds the ipad 2 and iPad air. Should be ok for the s5
What is the width of the lip of the stand? My iPad Mini with the case on is .75 of an inch and I'm wondering if it will fit in your stand.,The stand is not wide enough to accommodate the case
Will this work on iPad 1?,"I think that the ipad one will be too thick for the slot. It's a nice stand, though."
"How much does it way precisely, in ounces or grams?","It weighs 2 ounces, but really is stable and compact - it really is only 2 ounces I weighed it on my kitchen scale"
Does it fit the iPad Air?,"Yes. :) I put mine horizontally, so the recharging cable is to the side. I don't think it's as stable if you put the iPad vertically portrait style though. I have an exact same one for my iPhone, they sit next to each other on my desk. Works great for me."
"Is the stand adjustable once its in an upright position, meaning can i tilt it forward or back?",I don't think so.
can i use this for my Samsung 10.1 Tablet?,My grandson uses it with his tablet and it works for Nook.
Does this stand have a hole to run my iPhone charger cord through?,Nope - no hole.
can connect with laptops?,Yes if you laptop has Bluetooth 3.0 or higher. Or able to play AD2P. You would have to verify with the Laptop manufacturer.
Does the ear pads pivot a little or are they completely stationary?,"They don't pivot, but do conform to your head. Very comfortable. I love mine!"
Using a Audio Patch cord and bluetooth transmitter can you use head phones for TV?,"yes you can, however, i would pass on these because the quality is lacking"
can you use them wired?,No
I was about to buy these but the only shipping option was 28 days?? Is this an error?,"Most likely it's due to the manufacturer bein in a far away country (i think china) but unless you want them by tomorrow, i personally think the price is worth the wait."
Is it Compatible with a PS3?,Hello. If the PS3 has a Bluetooth function then there should be no issue using them with it. Thank you
"Need to replace the USB. Says Micro USB, but it seems to be a different size than a regular mini USB. Where can I find a replacement USB cord?",Mini and micro USB are different. Micro is the more common but this device uses a mini USB. I would suggest amazon for a new mini USB cord. http://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-USB-2-0-Cable--Male/dp/B00NH11N5A/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1431465887&sr=8-1&keywords=mini+usb
does this headset work with samsung galaxy 3?,It works on my Samsung 4. I don't know for sure if it works on3
My headphones keep turning themselves off...help?,"What do you mean exactly? They just started to do it? From day one, when you used the first time? Either way most likely you need to return if you still have warranty, other wise you need toget a new set any repairs is gonna be expensive if their not on the hundreds of dollars just count yor losses and get a new set"
"can i use with a wired, does it come with a wired","No, only wireless. thanks"
Are they compatable with an iPhone5?,Yes they are. I have the iPhone 5 and it works well with the iPhones. All of them.
I have three children will they be able to use these simultaneously?,"They are headphones, not speakers. Only one person at a time can wear them, and so can hear them."
Can I use it for Skype conversation???,They work fine with Skype and FaceTime.
how is the sound quality when making phone calls?,Quality is great for making and receiving calls.
can i use this for gaming head set like titan fall or COD ghost ?,Not sure im leaning more towards no
Does this case have any protection for the screen? I recently dropped my phone and shattered the screen. I need something tough.,"There is no cover for the screen. However, what prompted me to purchase this is that, like you, I dropped my phone and the screen broke. It broke because it hit in the side of the screen, not directly on the screen. This case has a rubber padding around the edges and insets the screen about 1/16th of an inch from the exterior of the case. So all in all, I think it offers a good amount of protection by keeping things from directly contacting the screen. Hope that helps."
will this fit a P935?,I don't think it will fit & the openings will be different for the lens for the P935 because yours runs up & down.
Will this case fit LG Optimus GPro 4GLTE?,"The case fits my LG Optimus G Pro E980 perfectly, however the clip doesn't fit properly, its to tight."
"The listing pictures show a different case &amp; stand than the 2 customer images, and it looks like the home button is blocked by the case. Which is it?","Mine is exactly how the retail pictures look like, nothing is blocked everything is easily accessible. I uploaded a photo of my case and phone to show you what the case looks like."
IS THIS CASE GOOD FOR ATT CARRIER?,Yes it works with my wife's phone and it is on AT&T
will this fit a LG 530G phone?,No this will not fit the LG 530g
Does this come with a clear screen protector or just the case?,Just the case..has a handy kickstand that works both horizontally and vertically..
Would this case fit a Samsung S4 or S5?,"this is made for lg optimus g pro .the samsung 4 ,5 are smaller"
Does this case have inner workings like the case it came in to be wirelessly charged? I want a case with that feature,"No, it does not have a battery or any wiring"
will it fit with a screen cover on,Yes it sure will! I have one on as well. :-)
Has anyone dropped theirs yet (on a hard surface) and did the phone survive / screen crack?,"I dropped mine a couple times (hard) with the case and the phone survived. Got a couple little nicks on the metal, no biggie. The Note 3 screen breaks easy, seen two friends screens break. My case has taken a beating, just ordered another one today. Overall the fit and finish and taking the beating is why I am ordering another one."
"Slim armor vs. neo hybrid questions, which case is thinner? The slim armor lists a thickness of 10.1mm... but what is the thickness of the neo hybrid","Hybrid is thicker and makes my Note 3 look and feel bigger. I honestly like the feel of the Slim, but the protection of the Hybrid. It's a toss-up."
Is the backside of the case raised to protect the camera lens?,Yes your camera is well protected it is raised
will it fit over the wireless charging back cover,"I don't think it will. I know one reviewer said it would, but the wireless charging cover is actually thicker than the standard back. It may stretch to fit, but I'm not sure it will fit properly."
will the case fit note2??,"This specific case is for the note 3, only. I'm positive the manufacturer sells an equivalent case for the note 2."
Call me Stupid..but there is only 1 piece right??that mainly covers the back..no piece for the front that snaps on&gt;&gt; Thanks for reading,"yes, there is only one piece which covers the back and some part of sides.. nothing is on the front."
Does the original back have to be on the phone to use this case? My phone does not have a back on it because of the see through Flip case I have on it now.,No it can stay in or you can take it off
Do I need a protective plastic or glass cover with this case?,"Hi, I strongly recommend you get a screen protector. While the case assists with a drop to the screen. My phone has remained like new with this combination."
"The black case says ""rubbery feel"" Is it rubber? Or plastic like the white one?",Rubber feel
Is this for also keeping original battery cover on?,"With this case , you can keep keep the battery case on."
Does this case get dirty easy,A little. And it's expected with the color white. But I will say it is just as easy to clean as well. I've had mine for only 2 months but it still looks brand new.
Is it hard plastic or silicone or rubber. Will glue or paint adhere well to it?,It's a soft plastic that is not very much protection if you drop your phone (especially the white cover). The black cover is very slippery and can slide out of your hands easily
Does the SPIGEN GLAS.tR SLIM Glass Screen Protector work well with this case or should I avoid tempered glass with it? I may pick up both....,Will work fine. Won't get in the way.
Will my N900A fit in this case?,"Yes, your AT&T variant will fit perfectly on this one. Only the Note 3 Neo is different. Regards"
Warranty by seller?,I am not sure. I never looked into it. I will say I love this case.
"If it gives very little protection, what is it's purpose?","The black cover has a nice design but the protection is minimal and the way the cover fits, it is easy to accidentally press the off button. I bought this for my wife and she has stopped using it."
How do you remove the case? Seems like some effort is needed,"It is not too difficult to remove the case. I typically removed the phone by separating it from the case where the stylus is. Once you have done it a few times, it becomes second nature. I typically popped the case on and off once a day to swap batteries and had no issues. After about 6 months the case cracked - not a big deal given how inexpensive it is."
Does it protect against bumps and drops?,"Well (thankfully) it hasn't had a drop but the little things it certainly had protected it from. It must of did it's job on one corner, there's a few little dents but nothing on the side/back of the phone. I deliver airplane parts and hit a lot of things against my pocket also and there's no damage yet. I'd definitely recommend this case way"
How well is it against bumps and drops?,It is pretty good. I have dropped it a few times and it was fine.
"In white, is it slippery, or does it give some traction?",Some traction. But it's very nice.
Will this cover fit the galaxy note 3 with the verizon wireless charging back cover on? Thanks for the help!,"No, I don't think it would fit with the slightly thicker charging cover. The Spigen cover fits snugly as is. You may have better luck with a thinner, more flexible tpu cover - but check around a bit first. It's possible that a cover would interfere with the wireless charging feature and even cause the device to overheat."
Will this case fit a note 3 n900 series?,"Yes, that's the phone I bought it for and used. Fits nicely."
Does this case have holes where the noise canceling mics are located? Should be two at the bottom and one at the top.,"Sorry for late replying, there's 4holes on the bottom(s pen, speaker, charging port & might be noise canceling cut out holes), 1holes on the right(this also might be a noise canceling cut out holes), 3holes on the top side(ir blaster, earjack holes, and might be noise canceling cut out again) I hope my answer help you decide which case you should buy :)"
"Both the Note 3 and the Note 4 are the same size (5.7 inch screen). So, it should fit either phone...right?","Yes and no. The exterior dimensions of the phones are different, so are the cutoutsame for mics, camera, USB port etc. For best fitment stick to buying one made for your specific device."
Does this case fit the new Galaxy Note 4?,"I'd probably advise against it. I'm sure it could ""fit"" but this thing is really snug on my phone so I would suggest note making the purchase and wait for the SGN4 case or go with another manufacturer."
This question is for Spigen Inc... Will this grey case fit galaxy note 4?,No i don't think so. Why not try searching spigen cases designed for galaxy 4s. The note 3 is bigger than the 4. Hope that helps
Is there anything similar in white or even pink? The white one pictured doesn't seem to have the back detail I really like . Thanks!,"Thank you for your question. Our Bounce case for the Galaxy Note 3, only come in the colors black and gray."
Do I have to remove the original back cover of the samsung galaxy note 3 for this case to fit?,"No removal necessary, it fits over the entire note 3"
"The ad claims the dimensions are 4.2 x 1 x 7.5 inches, but the Note3 is 3.0"" x 0.3"" x 5.9"". Am I missing something or mistaken?","The case is 3 1/4"" x 6 1/8"". I just measured it. No idea where the hell your measurements are coming from. It's a great case, I love it."
How thick is the phone after install? How does it compare to the caseology case?,"7/16"" thick which includes a 1/16"" protruding from screen for screen protection. Don't know the caseology equivalent equivalent."
fit,Yes
"Anyone use a credit card reader while using this case (square, quickbooks, PayPal, etc.)? Wondering if the top is too thick for the reader.",I had the case on my Note 3 when I used ISIS Wallet (now called Softcard) and my transaction went through just fine.
Is there a cut out for the speaker? The images in the product page don't show one. Would love to purchase need an answer 1st though.,"The speaker has a cut out, all the cut out are very nicely done and line up perfectly. Its a great case, I say go for it!"
"Does anyone know how this compares to the otter box commuter series case? As far as protection and the difference in size, thickness, etc.","Size and thickness wise, the otter box is thicker and more bulky imho. Protection wise I think they are the same, but ymmv."
I am in love with this case but I am also installing an ILoome 9H tempered glass screen protector... will this case fit with that protector installed?,Yes the the iLoome Tempered Glass screen protector will fit perfectly on this case. I know because I have the same screen protector on my phone and I have the Spigen Neo Hydrid installed. Hope this helped.
Does anyone know the specific differences between this product and their other Note 3 product for only 9.99 (SGP10441)?,"This case has two separate pieces, that one seems to be a slimmer, one piece, that covers the phone differently. I can tell just from looking at it that the actual buttons on the sides(volume rocker/power button) are accessible without being covered while this case the buttons are covered. Also, that one says it's rubbery while this one is not(TPU/ polycarbonate)"
Is there a film screen integrated into the case?,No. I recommend getting a spigen glas.tr screen protector to go with this case
Which glass screen protector works well with this case other than the one made by Spigen? Thanks.,"I couldn't tell you what other screen protectors work, but I use a ZAGG protector... I know it's more pricey than necessary...The Spigen case edge seems to allow a screen protector that goes very close to the whole face of the screen (if that makes sense). Hope that helps..."
Is the S-pan still easy to remove and put away?,Yes it is.. There is enough space for easy removal...
will this protect my screen,"No it will not, u still need a screen protector. But if you drop the phone it will protect the phone."
"hich one has thicker back, this or the UAG case ? Thanks",One thing for sure you don't need to take off the battery cover to use this case. So to me that's added protection. I have never used UAG case so I can't really compare for you. Although I love this case and feel that it serves its purpose in protection from a drop or fall. My 2-yo daughter tends to throw my phone a lot and my phone has not been damaged.
The outer white layer appears shinny and slick like the Note 3 itself. How secure does it feel holding onto the phone in this case?,Very nice and easy to manage. Nice case that always looks new n doesn't scratch. Nicest case for note 3.
I am comparing this case to the UAG which is 15mm thick. What is the thickness of the Slim Armor?,Very close to 0.50 inches.
Is this case compatible with the Spigen Steinheil Screen Protector or the GLAS.tR SLIM?,It should work no problem with GLAS.tR slim! Not sure about the Steinheil
"Do you need to remove the original ""leather-feel"" back cover to use this or not?",I have heard some people do but I didn't. It was tight fit.
Anyone using the Neo Hybrid case with a glass screen protector? How's the fit? I'm thinking about the BodyGuardz True for the Note 3.,I'm using the Spigen crystal clear screen protector with this case - fit is almost perfect to a point you can't see the edges of the protector.
"Without compromise to the case's integrity, does this case allow access to the S-Pen in the Note 3 N900V?",the plastic around the casing gets in the way a little bit
"Is the band cheap and glossy, and smudge easily? Or is it made of harder plastic that is not glossy and doesn't smudge?",No not at all it almost feels like metal its a hard plastic does not show finger prints very sturdy now take in mind I have the silver one I can't comment on the other colors
Ordered 2 Neo Hybrid cases. My infinity white came with a plastic packaging. My reventon yellow came with paper packaging? Anyone else?,Nope. My Reventon Yellow came in the nice hard plastic case.
with the case on does it fit in a holster,No
Does this case allow access to the S-Pen?,Yes
Does this comes with an authentic code?,"Yes, it is located inside the packaging."
"How grippy is the case, does it make the phone harder to hold on to? Or does it have a little ""tack"" to it? Would love a 'lil grip.",It has just enough of a matter finish to provide grip but not too much. It still slides into a pocket easily.
Can I buy just the protective ring? I don't want to have to buy 2 cases just for 2 different colors,"No you cannot. It comes in 2 , you can't buy it separately.."
"Does anyone know if this case can be used with a card reader (Square, Intuit, Paypal etc) or would it have to be removed?",I use Square and no obstructions. all Samsung wires and connections that came with the phone fit the case. If you're using a genetic/aftermarket wires and power connections make sure that they are narrow and thin at the base.
"Dimensions Size given in the detail link were (LWH): 4.25 inches, 1 inches, 7.5 inches. Are these measurements correct? Seem too big for phone. Has anyone taken outside measurements of this case? If so, can you share them with me / us? Thank you in...","this case is slightly longer than 6"". It is 3.33"" wide. It is .5"" thick"
"Will this fit the Original Samsung Wireless OEM back, the samsung back is a bit thicker than the original back.",Yes its thicker but not by much!
Would this case fit if i were to put a ballistic glass screen protector on the phone?,Yes
Will this case work with the wireless charging kit case that is made by samsung.,I just got this case. It does not fit correctly if you have the official Samsung wireless charging kit installed on your device.
"I had ordered a Spigen Neo Hybrid Case for Samsung Galaxy Note 3, when I received it in the mail it was a fake one, how can I be sure this one is genuine?","My husband said it came with a paper of authenticity and some code where he could register his case. The side of the case also said neo hybrid, which he said makes it a real spigen. Hope that helps"
What is the trim made of on the outer rim? And how does that help protect the phone?,The trim is made out of plastic. Its main purpose seems to be to secure the tpu protective layer in place
"There are 3 model numbers of what seem to be the same case on Amazon: SGP10452, SGP10453 and SGP10456. What is the difference between these model #s?","It's the stock# assigned to 3 of the various colors - Satin Silver, Dante Red & Infinity White. If you click on the color options you'll see that those SGP#s differ."
how do these compare against the otterbox defender ?,I never owned a otter box but this case with a protective screen protector is just as safe and it slims it down. It's light sturdy and feels awesome plus it doesn't get caught in your pockets lining
Will this fit a galaxy note 3 neo n7505 snug ???? I don't want to order it then have to send it back,No
Does this case work on Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Neo LTE SM-N7505?,as long as it is the note 3 and the same size button placement etc. it should work im not sure what model number mine is but it is the note 3 from at&t and it works fine but if it is a note 3 it should work perfect
Is it possible to order just the outer bumper? i already have the TPU and the bumper snapped.,I have seen other case brands that just sale the bumpers. But not for spigen
I need to find a holster that will fit this case. Any recommendations?,"it will be hard to find a holster that size. I don't use a holster, I only use a mount in my vehicle"
Is there any way to purchase the outside plastic individually?,It comes with the rubber insert. I guess you could remove the rubber insert if you don't want to use it.
how wide is this case,"This case is just barely bigger then the width of the Note 3. The exact dimensions are 4.2 x 1 x 7.5 inches ; 6.1 ounces. This case is really slim, it fits very nice and snug on the phone and easy to take on and off since the case is two layers. The width on the phone case is only added by the harder outer cover but it is still small enough I can hold and use 1-handed."
"Does this case leave the charging port at the bottom open, and will the phone still charge in a Samsung desk charging cradle with the case in place?","It does leave you access to the charging port at the bottom of the phone, but as far as placing the phone on a charging cradle it may not function because of the added protection around the case."
Does this slide in and out of the pocket easily?,"It's actually perfect for the pocket. Real easy to get in and out, but it doesn't fall out. I've bought 4 different colors because I love this case so much. I hope that helps"
Is it really protective in case of a fall? Any problems using the earphone jack?,I love this case. It's slim but still offers protection. I have not ran into any problems using the earphone jack. I would make sure I have a screen protector. It has a bit of a lip but I always opt for double protection for screen. Screen protector does not interfere with case install.
"The picture shows a BLUE case, and the description also says so; but the title says METAL SLATE. What exactly color are you selling in this listing?",Mine is blue through the view screen...qhen it works. The case is black
"Is this a 2 pc case, the inner rubber and the outer a plastic shell?",Yes it is 2 pieces. The inner is a rubber that goes around the whole phone and the outer is a hard plastic that covers mainly the back and the sides.
"For the metal slate, is the back smooth and glossy, or matte (similar to the Neo Hybrids)?","It is matte, not glossy. But still very smooth."
Will Paypal Here or Square card readers work with this case on the Note 3?,To be honest I have not been able to use my card reader on my Note 3 it says it is not compatible with my phone. I have to get a new reader to tell anymore on function. I will tell you that with the case on it does recognize the reader as plugged in.
Anyone compare this to Spigen Ultra Fit that's thinner? Does this offer significantly more drop protection than the slimmer Ultra Fit? Thanks.,no.front door fell off after a month cheaply made!!
"Says ""Sold by Spigen Inc and Fulfilled by Amazon"". Added to cart and checked again and now says ""Sold by and ships from Sipgen"". Which is it?","Both :) It always varies with Amazon. Sometime it's Sold and Shipped by Amazon. Sometimes it's only Fulfilled by Amazon. I am a Prime member, so I buy stuff that is sold by, or fulfilled by, Amazon."
"Hi, Is the feel a smooth slippery plastic or rubberized like the Incipio cases",The black part is a TPU rubber and it tends to be a little slippery but that's in rare cases (at least for me). It is really smooth and nice to the touch. The plastic band around the phone that keeps the rubber in place is glossy and really durable (but I don't suggest putting it to a lot of stress).
"Hi, does it come with the warranty certificate? Are you selling a genuine spigen that comes with the original box?","Since the seller is Spigen themselves, of course it's genuine. And yes, the warranty certificate is included."
What is the dimensions of this case?,The outside dimensions of the case after installation are: 11mm X 85mm X 151mm.
Is the opening of the charging port big enough for most micro USB 2.0 and micro usb 3.0 plugs?,"Actually glad you asked since I neglected to post about tthis. If your cable has bulky shielding near the connector it will in fact, prevent you from connecting to the note 3. I Only encountered this issue witha very old cable I had laying around. My car charger I got a while back, and several others I've encountered work perfectly fine though so it's not common to finda Cable that won't work, even then, this case isn't tough to get off like Otterbox cases can be."
anyone having a hard time with plugging the samsung charger cable with this case on?,Nice
will this fit the note 3 neo?,No
will the Amazon basic charging cord be easily connected to the phone or the opening doesn't fit ?,I had to trim the cable plug at a 45deg angle on the top to get it to fit
"The buttons on my outer surround piece came off, i purchased the case in Feburary. Is there a warranty procedure? Need a new frame asap...",You should contact Spigen to see about a warranty replacement.
Selling only the frame?,"your question is a little too short to give a good answer... but thecase cones in two parts.. rubber backing, and plastic frame that fits over."

Are there cutouts for the earpiece and home button?,Yep but really sticky to cut out once peeled

"Is this phone unlocked already?!!!...And can you add a flip cover and a screen protector with the order for free?...if no can, then include w/pricing?","Yes, we will help you to unlock the cellphone, and yes, will will also give you the flip cover and the screen protector to you, all of them, it is free. and before the shipping, we also help you to check the cellphone that if everything is ok, so, I ensure you will get a perfect cellphone."

Can you use the WiFi on a regular laptop or does it need to be an Iphone/ipad?,The item works with a free app available from Apple. If it can work with you laptop media programs I'm unsure but it's vey likely doable. Other than that this item is very well made and extremely durable. I recommend buying it as it will pay dividends for a multitude of home based projects.
can the camera focus on items at a distance of 5 feet with extra illumination or say in light bright enough to read by.,"Yes , no problem ."
Do you need to be connected to Wi-Fi to view images on I phone 5 while you are using it?,That I don't know we have androids so no we don't have to connect but not sure with apple products

What is the name of the ap you need to download?,StickNFind
is this water proof,"No, it is not."
Has anyone used this for its leash feature? I'm trying to find something that will alarm when leave my wallet sitting somewhere and walk away.,This will work great but only if your phone stays with your wallet at home and work otherwise be prepared for a bunch of false alarms when you go into another room with your phone but not your wallet.
Can anyone reccommend a good product? I am looking for something for my kids,The sticknfind works great inside your house to locate all objects. Your kids will learn to use it easily with the help of a cell phone.
Wich android devices does it support?,"A very small number. According to the sticknfind website, phones need to run Android 4.1 or higher, and support the new Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy standard. Check your phone's hardware spec (Bluetooth) and Android version before buying. Fortunately it appears the RazrMAXX HD meets both requirements."
Does it have a good range?,"It picks up the device for a pretty good distance, but finding it is almost impossible. It does not provide any direction toward the device and the distance is only a very rough estimate."
Has anyone dropped their phone yet? Was there any damage to phone or screen?,"As I stated in an earlier review it's not a high level protector case. But, my brand Samsung Galaxy S4 Active was in this case when it fell 4 feet off a shelf onto a hardwood floor. Maybe, not the toughest test, but no damage. Cover, it's not really a case, has a raised edge around screen to protect it if it falls flat on screen. My phone had a Bodyguardz Pure high temp glass screen protector on it at time of impact. It's really double protection since phone has gorilla glass screen."
Will this fit a sprint s4 ?,Yes
Will this fit the Galaxy S4 I545?,I don't think so since my understanding is that the galaxy s4 is bigger than the s2
I have an iPhone 5c. Can I buy this case? Will it fit properly? Thanks!,"On this brand you will have special cases for IPhone 5c, if it doesn't says so it doesn't macht it. I do have the 5 not the 5c so I do recommend to verifiy if it literally says it does fit your model"
Do all headphones fit this cases opening? or just the apple buds fit?,"The opening is narrow, but my aux-in cable (generic) and my Ultimate Ears buds (600vi) fit just fine, however my full sized Sennheiser won't fit. The Spigen Saturn has a more open bottom section that's more accommodating."
Can this be used with a tempered glass screen protector or only with a thin film style?,"I currently just use a film screen protector, but I believe I've read that tempered glass protectors work just fine as well."
Does this work on the IPOD 5?,I don't know about whether it would work on the IPOD.
how is it for drop protection?,"I have dropped it many times since getting my case about 6 months ago and it has held up very well so far! A few scratches, but it hasn't broken at all."
"by that when i select black color, appears in blue?",It depends on the angle and the amount of lights
what is the difference between this model and the SGP10089?,I honestly have no idea. I don't think there is any difference. The cheaper one has a bunch more reviews so I'd say go for that one. Just remember the plastic part scratches pretty easily
I'm looking for a case that will fit the Apple Lightning to 30-pin adapter. Does this one? Any recommendations? Thanks.,"No, I had to cut the space to fit the adapter myself. I would still recommend this case and cut it yourself. I love the case."
Does the fingerprint scanner continue to work with this case on the 5s?,Absolutely does. No interference at all. Good luck!
does the back of this case scuff/scratch easy?,"It depends how you treat your phone. I tend to stuff my phone in pockets, in bags and on tables; so I have a few scratches that are only noticeable if you're looking for them. On the other hand, my parents keep better care of their phones and they no scratches after 3 months with the case. Hopefully this helps!"
Could you take a razor blade to this and cut out the bottom to work with the 30-pin lightening adapter?,"I wouldn't recommend it. It has holes for the speakers and microphone, with another gaping hole the fit and hold may get compromised."
Does it include a lip in the front to protect the phone from falling face down?,No it's open on the front
"I have a iphone5, if I buy the iPhone5S Case, Spigen SlimArmorS looks good on my iphone5 because it is not the iphone5s, is loose, narrow or inaccura?","I'm not sure I understand your question, but you're supposed to be able to use this case for both iphone5 and 5s. It says it's ""Compatible with All versions of iPhone 5 (2012) / iPhone 5S (2013)"""
Does this case come with a screen protector?,"No, it does not. The company offers a supplementary product to provide screen coverage. However, I have found it is isn't needed for me as the lip on the case is sufficient to keep the screen off surfaces."
Does the back feel slippery?,"It's smooth, but not slippery."
Do you guys think skullcandy headphones will fit in the headphone jack opening?,I have the Skullcandy Titan earbuds and they fit.
Does this case support the 30 pin to lightning adapter?,"No, it does not. Other than that, it's a great case."
Will the 30 pin adapter fit properly?,No that is a down fall. I just tried to plug it into one yesterday and had to remove the case.
whats the difference between the S and the regular slim armor?,"The Slim Armour S is a newer version, a better-fitting case than the Slim Armour. I have had both and the older version had a couple of small gaps that the newer S does not have. The S fits great and looks even better!"
Does this case work fine with the new flash on the 5S?,"I have the iPhone 5s and it fits perfectly with the new flash. It doesn't obstruct it at all, and I don't notice any ""hazes"" from it."
drop,I've dropped it a few times and there was no damage to the phone or the case.
Is the bottom cut out large enough so I can plug in a third-party lightning cable? Specifically the Amazon branded lightning cable?,Yes. I use the Amazon branded lightning cable too.
Is it a hard material that can more easily slip out of my hand? Or does it have a grip to it?,"The shiny part is metal, and somewhat slippery. The end caps are exposed rubber and have a good grip. Overall? If your hands are small or slick this case isn't the most grippy."
Does the actual metal part of the case scratch easily?,"I have the white one and have owned it for about a two weeks or so and i am noticing a couple scratches and a few rubbed out spaces, but that is only on real close inspection."
Does the white on the back get dirty?,It does not get dirty but scratches incredible easy. Do not buy this case.
Does this come with a front screen protector included? ie: Steinheil screen protector?,This didn't but u can get a good discount on the from Spigen if u order together as they almost always seem to running a special on them.
What are the dimensions of the case?,"2 7/16"" x 5"" x 5/16"""
does this case fit with the zagg tempered glass,Should be fine with any of the tempered glass protectors
"Did anyone have any troubles connecting their headphones to the audio output jack through the case? If so, what kind of headphones were you using?",No problems connecting standard Apple headphones with this case.
will a tempered glass screen protector fit inside this case?,Yes
Is this compatible with Galaxy Note 4?,"I'm actually looking into it now. My husband is looking to upgrade to the Note 4 and we did a comparison. They look just about the same. Once he gets the new Note tomorrow, I'll report back."
Is this compatible with Galaxy Note 4,Yes
i just bought one and tried to place it on my phone i lifted it up by the bottom button it cracked never had that happen before is this under warranty,"Don't know about warranty but I have never had that occur. If your surface is cleaned and dry once you put it on careful to remove any minor bubbles after applying, it should not have to ever be removed. You also should have been given three button covers to apply over the button at the bottom. These are self adhesive. Remove the backing and stick directly onto the factory Note 3 button and you should be good to go."
Will bubbles develop months after installation? I've seen some people have had problems with this so should I be concerned? I'm debating between this one and the iLoome screenmate.,I received bubbles 2 weeks after installation. I purchased 2 and it happened both times. It went on perfectly but begin to bubble up and the edges lost adhesion. Great concept if it stayed on.
its compatible with the case neo hibryd,Yes. I have both on my phone now. You might want to put the Neo Hybrid on first to get an idea of where to put the screen protector but once you have it figured out it fits perfectly. Both are well worth the purchase and have saved my phone numerous times. 10/10 would recommend.
How does this product compare to the Zagg invisible shield?,No one on any of the android forums has had anything but problems with the zagg shield when trying to use their s pen so it's been advised that people stay away from it with their note 3s
does it leave water marks?,definetely not.
Does the S pen still work with this screen?,Yes. The S-pen works great with this screen protector
Will this screen protector fit with the otterbox Commuter case? I know others have mentioned defender.,I don't think the screen protector would interfere with any case
Is the screen protector come with a home button sticker?,"Yes, 3 colors white black and orange. I don't use them. I like it without them"
Is the case bulky? I don't want bulky!,No it's not bulky at all. I Love my case.

What color is it?,The phone and cover are black.
does this phone have a camera?,"Yes, it does have a camera."
I can just put my sim card in from another tmobile phone and it'll work?,"It worked fine for me! I burned my former Tmobile phone on the stove (don't ask!); one cover was melted and the battery destroyed. The other side of the cover was fine, as well as the SIM card. I bought a SparqII, and moved the SIM card just fine. No need for Tmobile store visit or customer care call. I'm delighted with the SparqII, but I did have to re-enter all of my contacts. Those are stored in the phone, not in the SIM card. Go for it."
Can you buy this phone from Amazon and just buy minutes from T-Mobile? Why is the phone twice the price on the T-Mobile site? T-Mobile adds for Sim starter kit and refill card -- do I need to buy that too to use it for prepaid? thanks for your help....,We bought the phone from Amazon and it came with Sim starter kit (although no refill card). We just added minutes on the T-mobile web site and were on our way! I would definitely buy it here over from T-mobile.
is there a manual?,"Hi, yes this phone comes with a manual in the package."
"The Phone Breaks down so fast ,WHY???",My guess would be the price and the relevance of the technology.
I already have a T-Mobile prepaid phone. Can I just switch the SIM card and my minutes over to this phone ?,Yes

Just bought my phone &amp; cannot find where on the phone is other ring-tones to choose. Am I stuck with only the one that came on the phone?,"Go to Settings, Profiles, (select Options under one of those choices such as General, then select Customize, and there are all of your choices. I have NewGarden volume 5, for my ringtone, and for Messages I have Marimba, but it's entirely your choice."
Do they inlcude a ready-to-use-sim card and a phone number?,"There was a sim card but we put in the old one from our old phone to keep the same package from tmobile. Therefore, not sure it it has it's own number."
can you use your sim card in this phone,Yes
can it be used on metro pcs,"Metro PCS is gsm now, so yes, it should work."

I have T-Mobile service now will this phone work and can I use my sim card in it,Yes u can
Do it have warranty? Is it new?,No I do not have warranty yes it is a new phone
Do you need two sims for the phone to work?,You don't need two sima just put one sim and you are good to go just select sim one or two depends on which sim slot you put your card .
Can you tell me what the case is made of? Is it plastic? Does it bend or is it hard solid?,it is solid clear plastic.(hard) overall it gives a good protection.
"How well does this case hold against drops? (case damage, separating, etc)","I purchased this as advertised for the 520. It doesn't fit the 520, it is 1/8"" too long. I have dropped it and it split apart and the two pieces flew."
Is the clear case completely clear or opaque? Would I be able to place pictures/designs underneath the case and still see them clearly?,"I purchased the black rubberized case. This case is outstanding. It offers a nice contrast to the white Lumia 521 that I have. I imagine that the clear case would accommodate pictures. However, I would highly recommend the black rubberized case."
I wear glasses... will that be a problem wearing this headset?,There will be some interference between the temples of the glasses and the headset. I have tried to wear both shades and the headset set while jogging and ultimately decided to remove the glasses due to uncomfortable fit however wearing both glasses and the headset is not impossible but I would not recommend it. Hope this helps.
"Could you post a real picture of the device, so that I see how it looks like without the flexband?","what you see pictured is the device without the flexband, the flex band is a shorter band that connects in the inner part of the band you see pictured"
Are these refurbished or what do u mean by bulk packaged,This may not answer your question directly. However packaged you get the full set. My experience with these was poor. They sound and function well when they work. I had two fail inside 60 days. I no longer consider this product commercially viable.

iphone 5,It has worked with both the Samsung Galaxy S3 and S5. A great bt headphones
how long does the battery last.,I use it two hours a day to work out and I charge it once per week.
Does this work well on dashboard plastic as opposed to windshield?,"I've got mine mounted on the shiny dashboard plastic on the top of my center console in my Honda Element. It has been holding perfectly since I bought it, even in 90 degree plus weather. I'm not that gentle with it either, frequently yanking the phone out from the jaws rather than unloading the clamp to remove it."
Does it work with the lumia 1520. It's a 6 in phone,"Hello it does work with LG G2 and with Samsung Galaxy Note 3 which i think is around 6 inches also. Can`t tell you that it will work with your Nokia, but just in terms of phone size i will say: YES"

People have recommended the 'more expensive one with a better mount'..is that the white one which is $10...or are there other models w/ better mount?,"I have two black ones and they work fine. I have one on brushed aluminum, and it works pretty good, and one on lexan, and it works great. I recently found that an associate has a Tesla, and he has a white on on his dash. Maybe the white one is better, as I only have a Nissan."
Does the phone vibrate while driving?,Yes it does
I see it fits a Note but does that mean a Note 3? How about a Note 3 with a TPU case (not the crazy thick ones but just a standard TPU type case). Thx,"I think its easy to get it, but if you want to use the mount on dashboard, u need to buy the newest model which is Galaxy Matrix:B00K2L6P6U, will be better for you! http://www.amazon.com/Galaxy-Matrix-Windshield-Dashboard-Suction/dp/B00K2L6P6U But anyway, gmatrix always pay free return for you, if you feel not good! thanks for your question! Gmatrix"
Can anyone tell me the size of the mount's ball?,what you mean the size of the ball?

My battery was drained the day after I put it in there.,"You should never leave electronic devices (charging or otherwise) plugged into receptacles that power them when engine isn't running..

Can this be used for HTC cell phone?,Yes. Works with any device that has a standard earphone input.
does it fit iphone 6,Yes it does fit iPhone 6
do these earbuds work with the Samsung Galaxy S4???,There is not a microphone with these headphones so you can not utilize the cool voice control functions of the S4. The sound is great and the volume control works great with my S4.
Will the armband fit an iPhone 5S in LifeProof case?,yes it does.
Is the microphone hands free talking on the phone?,"Hi Barry - I have tried it with my android phone and works really well. In fact, I was working out and got a phone call. The person on the receiving side said it was really clear."

Are replacement parts available for purchase (extra eartips)?,Yes extra parts are available. They have many ear tops you can actually pick from. It just depends on how you like them.
Will they work with a Eclipse MP3 player?,"They probably will, but save your money and look elsewhere for headphones. These things are completely worthless. Hard to get into place, do a horrible job at cancelling surrounding noise and are just all around junk. I've bought $10 headphones that work 10X better than these things. Just my 2 cents. Which is about all these things are worth."
Does the volume buttons work for android samsung S4 ?,Yes. Its a simple slide up/down. No Mic.
What is the sound quality with these earbuds? I want something that will deliver a good amount of bass while cancelling out background noise.,"From a scale from 1-10, about a 6."
I am a runner and I was wondering how well these cancelled out sound.,"they are pretty goid, but dont expect them to last very long. mine broke after 6 months"
Can I use this with a 2nd gen iPod?,Works with anything that has a headphone jack.
Does this work with droid turbo by motorola,I wouldn't recommend it. It doesn't work well with my iPhone or my samsung galaxy S5. Its really kind of junky.
Would this be compatible to use as a PS3 headset?,Yes I think it would be compatible works great
Does this read incoming text messages when in driving mode,It works for sometimes but the battery never last...and the distance you talk is shorter.
Does this work with Samsung Galaxy Grand?,Yes it works
Does Bluedio DF630+ Bluetooth Stereo Headset/Wireless headset work with LG 4G LTE telephone,I would think so. My phone is lg and it worksreal good hope this answer helps
"My bluetooth connected only when charging, when taken off the charger it does not work. I let it charge over 2 hours. What should I do?","Did you pair it right? Scan for device on your phone. Hold big white button to pair it. Then when you turn blue tooth on your phone, connect it. If that doesnt work, u may need to send it in to get another one."
should a like stay on when fully charged? Should you only charged using USB charging cable?,"The light should change color from red to blue when fully charged, I believe. Does your headset talk to you in Chinese?"
Is the black earpiece that hooks to the ear plastic or rubber? The plastic ones I have from the Bludio 66i all broke and I cannot get get replacement,It's hard plastic and it comes with a couple extra
Does this work with iPhone 4/4s,yes.
Is operator on this device speaking in english ?????,No its in Korean
Does this streams music and audio from iphone ?,"Yes, and it sounds nice."
can u make a cal with jest the headsat,By pressing the Answer button twice you can make a call to the last dialed number in your mobile phone.
"Bought a df630, love it, but changed my phone and can't remember the pairing sequence, can anyone help please ?",try 0000
is it compatible with iphone 3gs ?,I have a glaxay S4
Would this work with Samsung Galaxy note edge,"All I can tell you is that my sister does have a Galaxy note (not the edge), and my brother has a different phone, and the bluedio works on both phones."
"Is there a way to turn off the voice notices of battery getting low? When I'm talking to someone, I can't hear them when this message starts.",No
So maybe this is a dumb question but can you listen with both ears...I wasn't sure what the Bluedio DF630 is?? Thanks!,Absolutely. This headset has a plug-in piece which makes it stereo. It will also stream music just through the main headset.
Will this Headset work with an iphone 3gs?,Yes
It is a true stereo? Or only psevdostereo?,"I don't know the difference from a regular head set like this one and a stereo head set. I'm happy with this device for a number of reason one being that it's easy to turn on and off unlike others that require a button being pressed for a few seconds and maybe it turns on. This one has a slide switch and when it activates, your phone tells you it's activated and connected. When a call comes in, you just say yes or no to accept or deny the call. Hanging up requires you press a button unless, of course, your phone is smart enough to hang up automatically at the end of a call. All together, I don't think this has any stereo effects worth mentioning but, it is impressive in other ways. Mind you, you are getting this information from a cheap guy. I don't spend too much on electrical devices. No fancy bells and whistles for me. Just give something that works and is dependable and this device has been that."
Which model earhooks is it compatible with?,I know it's pairs with samsung and apple iphone
Is this a complete set or do I need to purchase an additional item to be able to charge my s5 wirelessly?,"It is complete as far as what's needed for the S5. You will still need your AC wall charger that came with the S5 to power the wireless pad. They do include a USB to mini-USB cable with it, though."
does it work with otterbox defender case?,"Yes. I am currently using my Samsung Galaxy S5 with an Otterbox Defender case and I am able to charge my device using the wireless pad no issues. In fact, it works better than charging with the Samsung charging pad I have."
is the receiver waterproof too ?,I tested this out and water gets through.
Does the charger stop when the phone is fully charged or will it still send an electric current to the phone?,"The Samsung Galaxy S5 includes logic to enable the Qi wireless charging process. According to the Qi specification, communication is one way from the receiver (S5 + receiver coil in this case) to the transmitter (charger pad). The receiver modulates the wireless charging field to send requests back to the charger pad for more or less power. In the case of the S5, it never tells the charger pad to turn off when it's at 100% charge. It tells the charger pad to reduce the charge to a minimum. Other devices, such as the Nexus 4, may tell the charger pad to turn off when it hits 100%."
If i attach the coil to my phone can i remove it or is premaritally on my phone?,The charging card mounts inside your case and can be removed when you like. You hsve to remove the charging card like the battery. It does not interfere with charging with the cord if left in. I use wireless charging and the wall charger. The best of both worlds.
Can this pad charge 2 Galaxy s5's at the same time? Or will it only fit 1 device at a time?,"I don't know for 100%, but I'm pretty sure it will only do one at a time. If you stacked one on the other, the top device may be too far from the pad to charge."
Will this work with the Samsung wireless charging cover or do you need to use your cover?,"Yes, it will work with any and all wireless covers or connectors"
Can I purchase a second receiver coil to use in a second Samsung S5?,You can buy the receiver coil here: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JN1ZNT0/
Does this interfere with the water resistance?,No effect on the water resistance as the wireless charging tag sits inside the waterproof battery compartment.
is this a fit for the galaxy s5? the picture for the receiver doesnt seem to allign or match the connections on the phone itself,"I have a Verizon Wireless Galaxy S5, and I purchased this kit for use with it. I can confirm that the receiver fits fine, no cutting necessary."
Does this also fit Tracfone Galaxy Centura phone?,I have the Galaxy Centura and it fits just fine.
How do I take it off to put in a new battery?,Where your power button is there should be a little space below where you can stick your thumb nails into separate the harder part of the case.
Will this fit a samsung galaxy discover sch-r740c?,I think the Discover and Centura are the same phone.
Does this seller combine shipping on products?,"Yes, we offer combine shipping discount on our phone cases. Please see our shipping rates here :"
How do you get the phone out of this case? Any suggestions?,Pull the case apart at the seams. I have done it a couple of times.
Is it possible to buy just the hard outside pieces that snap on this case?,I am sure what you are asking? It is the case itself that I bought. If the question is about parts? The answer I assume would be no.
does this case work well with samsung s738c for Tracfone rather than net10?,No idea. You'd have to contact the manufacturer.
will it fit samsung galaxy discover,Not sure about the other models check out if the holes match
I just want to check and make sure this is the right amount of power for my 1st gen iPad Air and will not effect it's battery life,"I bought it for my 5s and ipad 2, and It works fine at the same time."
Will it give all 3.1A through one port?,"I'm not sure what you mean by that, honestly, but I can tell you that I have a dual port I use for my iPhone 4 and basic Kindle, and they both charge quickly and fully. My son-in-law uses one for his iPad Air and iPhone 5s, and they also both charge fully and the charge lasts a full day. Hope that helps."
"Will this work for Samsung Galaxy Note 3? Has anyone tried? If so, which port and will the iPad Mini 2 work with it at the same time?","As long as it fits, it work. Yes, ipad mini will work with it at the same time. But remember it will charge slower if you're using both ports."
I'm traveling to Malaysia soon! Is this adapter able for me to charge my ipad mini and my NOKIA Lumia 520?,Should be fine. I use mine for my iPad 3 and iPhone 5 all the time.
Will this charger automatically adjust the current or will it fry it? I have a phone that requires 1.0A and dont want extra current flowing..,"The device being charged regulates the rate at which the battery is charged. So if you have a charger that charges at a low rate, the device being charged is limited to the lower rate of the charger. But if you have 3.1 amps available, some devices can charge very quickly. With modern charging circuits, having more than enough current available is a good thing!"

Why do you show some in stock but tell me that I will not receive my order until NOVEMBER 18th??,"we still have the screen in stock, and takes 7--10 working days to delivery in USA, maybe the estimated delivery time on amazon not correctly"
Why is that I can't change the brightness level after I installed it? This is the 2nd time I bought this product and this has happened.,"The only thing I can guess is that one of the internal parts or connectors may have been damaged or not been connected properly during the process the first time, or both replacements were defective. When I replaced my screen I damaged the the foil on the sticky part of the volume strip and my volume up and buttons do not work."
Is this screen compatible with Lg Optimus G F180L (Korean Version)?,"Honestly i dont know the phone i have is the ls970 so i dont kbow the differences between the two but mine almost did not fit and it is ""advertised to fit"" so i wouldnt chance it"
"Hello, how many days for shipping to zip 63301. do you offer expidited shipping. thanks","usually it takes 7--10 working days to zip 63301, USA, expedited shipping is possible but the shipping fee is $32. we have some items is one the way to amazon warehouse and will arrived in the later 2 days, if you could wait, we could inform you once our item arrived at amazon warehouse in USA and you purchase and ship to you by FBA, what do you think?"
Does this include the digitizer?,"The digitizer and screen are mated together, that's what the ZeroGap thing is. This product comes with the screen/digitizer assembly plus front bezel and internal components mount points."
"Hi, will it work with E976?.",I have an lg optimus g sprint model. It works for my phone. Not sure if it will for yours but i would say no. Contact lg to make sure. They have live chat also.
These are made in Vietnam rather than China correct? Should say on the connection point where the ear phone cords join to the auxiliary cord,They're marked made in China.

"i827 is a Samsing Galaxy Appeal, not Galaxy Express. So what model (I8730 or I437) is this?","I received this phone yesterday, bought from Amazon. It is the Samsung Galaxy Express (SGH-i437ZSPATT) Go-Phone. Apparently the wrong model number is on Amazon's web site. I will be writing a review in the future but so far so good. Beware, even though you are directed to use your old SIM if you have an existing Go-Phone account, I could not. My previous phone, only two years old, had a larger size SIM than this phone uses. I had to call AT&T and have them change over the info from my old SIM to the new smaller SIM. They were very helpful and patient but it took over a half hour to accomplish this. Make sure you do this or you will lose all the money in your account!"
Does it come with a charger?,"I bought it used and they sent me a generic charger. I highly recommend getting the original charger or similar, but original. Muhco more battery life and does not overheat, loading it with the original."
Can this be used as a wifi hot spot?,Yes. Go in to the playstore and download the app called foxfi. Works amazing
Thinking about getting this phone. I currently have an LG P506 android version...,I assume you want to know if you should replace the LG P506 with the Samsung Galaxy Express. I replaced my wife's and my LG P506 with the Galaxy Express several months ago and we both couldn't be happier. I still can't find any negatives with this phone. Do it! There is no comparison between these phones.
Does this phone require you to pay something EVERY month or do you get 90 days before the minutes stop rolling over?,"it's not about this phone, it depends on which ATT prepaid plan you purchase, you can pay monthly prepaid plans versus 10 cents per minute and if you prepay $100, those lasts up to 365 days and you need to add more money before the money expires"
Do you have to have a data plan to have this phone?,"no, no data plan nor any plan , if you just use as a phone and texting."
gps,"I didn't use it that often, but it was able to pinpoint my location."
what charger fits this phone?,"I think it is a small USB plug. I bought a charger from amazon for less than $5.00 which included a car charger and USB ""download"" plug. Fred S."

Are you able to download apps because someone else said it is not from Samsung and has useless apps?,"I purchased it initially after extensive research about the FEATURES of the phone. I was satisfied and bought it from here. However, I did NO research on whether it had ever been produced factory sealed without connection to a service, which apparently it does not. Mine came from Vodacom, a company I've had a service with before, so I was somewhat familiar with the apps they add to the phone, which, like the Samsung Apps, can NEVER be removed without rooting the phone (which is a little like jailbreaking an iPhone, but slightly riskier). I have not rooted it, but have hidden the samsung and Vodacom apps from all menus, but they still pop up from time to time when it reboots. As for the android system, it can receive new apps from the Google Play store completely as normal. Also, Vodacom finally pushed a global KitKat update on these, FINALLY. Before then you had to go to a shop to update it, and Vodacom doesn't have shops in my current country!"
Are you able to download apps because someone else said it is not from Samsung and has useless apps?,You can download apps. Make sure it is compatible with your service. The one I bought wasn't. Wasted my money.

Does it work with an iPhone 4?,"I'm using an LG phone and it works great...if the IPhone 4 takes the mini usb cable it should be fine...most phones take the mini usb, but I'm not sure about the Apple phones."
how does it turn on?,"It doesn't have a power button. As long as it's fully charged it will work. When the device itself is charging, there is a red light that comes on and when it is done that goes away and when it's charging your phone there is a blue light that turns on!"

When under the pairing mode(blue light keeps bright), you can press the MF button and the volume - simultaneously, and you can hear a beep, then the language is changed."
What is the difference between the models 14s and 14?,"Actually Its (i4) I4s and I4. I4 is bluetooth 2.0 and has raised option buttons on the device for play, stop, etc,. I4s is bluetooth 3.0 ( better range, better battery life, faster data transfer if your using it for such a task) and is backwards compatible with 2.0 devices. Also the option buttons are flat and flush with the device which makes for a seamless and smooth look and feel."
Can it use with Android phone?,Yes if it's Android/Bluetooth capable.
How well and seamless does the multipoint work ? Can i connect to tablet to watch movies and simulatenously connect to phone to receive call ?,It works pretty well you can watch a movie and be connected to your phone. When the phone rings your movie will stop to allow you to talk.
anyone know how to change the language it speaks at first it was in English now its in Chinese I would think is a combination of button presses,"Hello dear customer, it can be switched. In the pairing mode(blue light remains bright, not blinking), press the MF button and volume - at the same time, and then the language is changed. Hope it helps a little."
I got i4s but couldn't get it paired with Samsung phones. Hold the button to see the blue light flash quickly but the phone couldn't find it.,"Hold the button on i4s until the light stays on, not flashing, then release. The light should stay on without flashing, this is the pairing mode. Turn off and then turn on your samsung bluetooth and it should start searching for the i4s, if not, push the samsung bluetooth search for new device to find it. You should see the i4s show up on Samsung bluetooth list. Check the instruction sheet that came with i4s for a more detailed instruction."
Does it support Auto Connect? (if you switch the headset off and on will it connect automatically to the device?),"Yes, it supports. As long you have paired it with your device successfully at the very first time."
Can anyone tell me how to prevent it from coming on at top volume? hard on the ears if you forget and turn it on with earbuds in.,"I don't recall it happening to me, but keep i4 volume on medium and control higher volume with phone. ..I usually turn volume down on the phone before disconnecting or powering off!"
Will this work with iPad?,If the ipad has bluetooth.
"Please be clearer on how to change the language back to English. Explain ""pause the Bluetooth first""","switch on unit. once connected. tap the on/off button AND The volume down button at the same time. every time these two buttons are pushed at the same time, you can hear it scroll through all the different languages. just keep tapping until you hear your chosen language"
"hello sir, can we use this device to send songs from my smartphone or my mac computer to a powered speakers (10 ft away) with RCA input jack on this speaker ? thanks in advance.","Yes, I use rca jack to connect it to my Onkyo receiver and stream through my iphone"
Is this small enough to make my headphones wireless but not look too conspicuous?,It is small. About the size of my pinky long and and a thumb wide. My husband mounted it inside of his motorcycle helmet. He loves it. The thing he likes the most is not only does it connect to his phone it also has a blue light that let's you know when it's charging. There is a clip on the back that allows you to place it anywhere. We removed that and added velcro so he could mount it. It has volume buttons and buttons to answer and hang up calls. Plus a mic and skip forward and back buttons. We love it. I hope this helps.
I lost my charger. Could someone tell me what is the charger's output specifications. I wanna know if i can use my phone's charger.,"It plugs into the usb port, so anything that is powered or charged by usb can be used. I purchased a spare cable for a Nokia phone and used it! http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004PBFG0Y/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1"
Is there a mic on the device or does it rely on an in-line mic on the headphones?,It's on the device.
"I lost my charger cable, can I get it replaced without buying a whole new headset?","From the picture, it looks like a Nokia charger plug. If there's a Radio shack in your area they probably have a large assortment of charger tip adapters (typically there's a number of dummy charger tips on a ring so you can just try likely looking ones). Downside is that this isn't going to be a lot cheaper than just buying a new unit. If you go to rat shack and find the one that fits, could you answer your own question so other folks'll know?"
Am I missing a charger or is the only way of charging this unit via usb port? Does not look like the picture in the manual.,"Hello dear customer, i am sorry the package doesn't have a charger included. You can use a charger for your phone to charge the headset, 5V, under 1A would be okay."
Any users using multipoint actually in day to day life with this Bluetooth ? Experiences ?,"The one I have doesn't work well, unhooks after about 30 seconds then you most reconnect."
"Is the charging Pin same as Nokia Thin Pin ? If i lose the charger, can i buy nokia thin pin charger and will it work with this BT device ?","it's like the Nokia charging cable. There isn't a wall plug charger. If lost the cable, a Nokia thin pin would be okay."
it says support multipoint on description but on technical detail is markes as NO ... does this support multipoint to connect 2 devices at same time ?,"Dear, it supports multipoint to connect 2 devices at same time .I Will correct the detail soon. Hope this help Bluedio team"
"Does this kit allow for plan unlimited data (5GB), unlimited text, 100 min talk that was launched for walmart customers?",Yes I just started that plan with this product. But you have to activate on the t-mobile website.
Does this come with $30 credit or is it only the sim card?,It come with $30 credit and a sim card.
"100 minutes, talk, so, it mean when you received a call, you are wasting from your 100? or only when you call?",Both ways
"I'm buying a new moto g unlocked, I want to purchase this sim card, I already have a tmobil acct and want to keep my same phone # can i switch numbers","Yes, just dont cancel your current account until after you port your number over. It is very easy!"
Does it require an IMEI number,Yes it does!
Can I keep my current phone number if I switch to this plan? (Right now I have verizon),"Yes, but it takes up to three days to transfer your number. Instructions for this will appear in the setup process."
So this is a micro sim with the $30 credit already on the card right?,Yes.
Does it work with the LTE Nexus 7?,I'm using it with nexus 4 and nexus 5. Both work perfectly so I don't see a problem with the N7
"If i don't put prepaid card after 90 days, will my number become useless or still activated?","I'm not 100% sure, but I believe if you register the number on their website, the number stays allocated for a while. I have a prepaid SIM that had not seen activity for 8-9 months (between GS4 launch and Nokia 521 sales) and it still worked. I put $10 on it to test a phone and it was fine, same number and all. T-Mobile will probably not guarantee your number to stay available indefinitely, but you won't lose it immediately."
Does this kit work with an unlocked Iphone 4s,"I don't see why it wouldn't. To use your data though you have to change the APN settings for t mobile. All you gotta do for that is open safari, go to unlockit.co.nz, I believe, then download the APN settings thing, then choose the T-Mobile prepaid one I think. I had to do that when I had go phone on my 4. But I have this T-Mobile on the nexus 5. But yeah if your 4s is unlocked it should work."
"This item can't be found by my phone or PC. I'm following directions from all devices and getting no where. Suggestions, before I send it back","press the power on/off until you see the blue light steady (blue light on, not blinking) then let go... Now, go to your device bluetooth settings, put it in search mode and wait. is it take about 5 seconds to find the bluedio t9+. if is asking for a code just input 0000, or may give you a automatic access number just select yes...."
can you listen to music,No can not listen to music
Does this support Android voice dialing? The last Bluedio headset I bought didn't work with voice dial.,I'd let you know tomorrow... cause I ain't used it in like a 3months..it keeps cutting out on me as I talk like the range between my cell in my pocket and the bluedio in my ear..it disconnects..but I'll charge it to see if it does great on voice dial

Anyone with a Majicjack that can help me hook it up to a Bluetooth. Majicjack says it works.,I just never try! May be

"Goodnight, what is the difference between this edition and blue edition of GPG? Another question. The price is included the activation?",blue edition - is the newest version of z3x box but functionality is the same as for black samsung activation is included in this price
"Goodnight, what is the difference between this edition and blue edition of GPG? Another question. The price is included the activation?","Hola Nestor. We have mostly the new edition from GPG. The difference is that the GPG model comes with dual smart card reader, an extra just in case you need to use the box as uart interface only or you can see it as a spare reader. Activation is included. Operations are unlimited, no yearly aditional costs or memberships."
Does this unlocks telus note4,It does not support those models yet
works whit SHG-A157?,No perrita
"Hi, i purchase this product weeks ago, and i have tried to run hardware wizard unsuccessfully. Could you help me?",Same problem I have.... I bought it through a reseller here in the USA and the product came from China no customer support they send you to forums to download software and drives... I'm ready to give bad reviews. Sorry we are on the same page
I am confused on how to charge the charger. below it says your power outlet so do you hook it to your phone's plug for charging?,You switch the USB cord around and then plug it into your computers USB port. I was confused at first too. Lol
I bought a set of these for gifts. One has a rattle when shaken. The others seem to have odd alert light combinations. Explanations would help?,"There should be a manual in the box describing the lights, if you have not got this manual you should receive a link to it very soon via email, as this is set up as a standard procedure. If not do contact me via a mail where I can submit an attachment as I cannot do it via Amazons email - you can send me an email via our lemikdk dot com site. The rattling sounds like an error so do ask Amazon to replace this item or again send us a mail via lemikdk."
how many charges for iphone until battery is dead,"I see this as 2 questions : 1) how many times can you charge before having to recharge the remote charger - well that is purely a matter of from which state you charge from - I myself has charged more than 10 times before charging the remote charger again, however if the phone is totally down each time you charge it's another matter - then maybe two to three times before charging the remote charger again. 2) When is the battery totally dead and you have to buy a new charger - this is a matter of where you contain the charger on a daily basis (a cool place is better than directly in the sun) and again a matter of from which state you charge from, so it is in fact impossible to say,however, I have had my own for a year now, and it is still functioning. When this is said, then it is not necessary to buy a new charger if you use one with a replaceable battery as for example our stainless steel charger, which also have a larger capacity than the one in question - try to look after ASIN B00I01P196 in the amazon store."
Can you tell me when it is charged and what the blinking red light means? Can you send me instructions?,When its blinking multicolors or a steady green or blue its fully charged. Red means its still charged. When it blinks its charged.
Does it work on the ipad Air,"The only thing I can suggest is try it - I know that the capacity (2600 mAh) is too little for Ipad 3, but I am not sure with the iPad Air. If it not works with the Ipad Air then you have a possibility to return the item. We will, however, in the spring have some luxury chargers with larger capacity and I can give you a promocode for this if you find out that this does not work on the iPad air, and you decide to keep it anyway. Just send me the receipt for payment and confirm if it works or not, and if you wish to keep it anyway."
"what cables, are needed? Does a cable come with it?",No cables come with it. You need your normal cable for your device with a normal USB connector to attach to the charger
Does it take 2 double A batteries ?,no it is chargable from your power outlet
Does this constantly charge?,"No, once you push the button on the back, it does charge. But unless you have pushed that button it will not."
Would this work on iPhone 5s?,"Yes, It does. I have the 5s."
Is this product Apple-approved so it will work with future IOS updates?,"It does not specifically say apple approved. There's just a sticker that's says for iphone 5/5s. But one key note is that the USB connection doe not allow for file transfer. You'll have to remove the phone from the case which is not hard, and using the original cable. I do it all the time...kinda a hassle. But this charger has worked great so far, compared to the cheaper battery chases. I've returned so many because they were cheap or stopped working."
will this work in an iPhone 5c? does the iPhone s &amp; C have the same size? Thanks in Advance,Yes it works perfectly thanks for the item
can i stop it once i started charging?,"Hi Andrey. Yes, you can. Simply press the power button at the back of the battery."
size? weight?,"It is 5.5 inches by 2.5 inches by .75 inches, without the phone it is mere ounces. The heaviest part is the extra battery."
This works for Iphone 5c ?,No
"Does the power button toggle power on and off when pressed, or just on?","If you're referring to the iPhone's power button, it will still toggle power On and Off."
From 0% how much does it charge?,It varied a bit because of useage that stays on (like location services and push notifications) but it was a consistent extra 35-45%
Does the Top layer stay on pretty well? If I drop it it wont pop off will it? I am thinking maybe this and glass protector is best vs defender?,Yes. It's an amazing case
the front view of case shows a strip running along the top and the bottom....is this part of the outer case.....or a second piece?,There is only a front and back. The lines/strip is just the design. Use for my iPhone 5s and love it.
Will this fit the Iphone 5C?,The C and S have to different shapes around the edges. If it does not specifically say 5C do not buy it! I have the 5S and love this case. Can't use the Touch ID but it is ok
Does this product have a screen protector?,"Dear Buyer, Please see the full description of the product below: Body Glove Shocksuit Series Case The Body Glove ShockSuit marks a new step in slim yet rugged design.

Can you lay a phone or tablet (Nexus 7) down sideways and charge it or does it have to be in an upright position?,I have the nexus 7 tablet (2nd gen 2013 by ASUS) and it has to be sideways to charge.
How long is the power cord?,"There is a 5 ft cord with the charger and yes it is a unique power cord,"
Does it work with Nexus 6/HTC one m9?,With the Nexus 6 I know it works because I used mine with it. The M9 I don't know
will this work with the Kyocera Brigadier,"Yes, it took some digging to verify that the standard used on the Brigadier is Qi, but the spec sheet right at Kycoera says so. http://www.kyoceramobile.com/brigadier/Brigadier-Consumer-Spec-Sheet.pdf"
Will this charger work with Nexus 6 using a i-blason armorbox?,Not sure but I never take my case off to charge
Charger is twitchy with my Samsung Galaxy S6--but only upright. Sideways it is very forgiving where it is placed--is this normal?!,Not sure on the S6.....my S5 with a thick case was great sideways but not so good upright......i changed to a different thinner case and no problem....
Does this make your phone over heat? And how long can it sit on this device before it overheats?,I have used the tylt with an LG G2 and G3 and haven't experienced overheating. I am not positive but I believe that it has the same protection against overcharging (source of overheating) as normal chargers.
I understand this will work with the Galaxy S5's standard battery. Is this correct?,"Yes, but you need to have a wireless charging back on the S5."
all of sudden it requires the phone to be placed just right to charge? is the unit defected?,"I would think if it were defective, it would just stop charging entirely. I have had the Vu act a little picky before, and solving it required doing two things: first, unplugging the Vu charger for a moment then plugging it back up, and second, rebooting my phone. One or the other worked in my case and it's been fine ever since. If you just put a new, thick case on your phone, that could affect the ability to charge as well."
"Where can we find the ""back door"" accessory to make the phones compatible with these chargers?",The answer truly depends on the phone that you need this for. For some phones there are oem accessories that will convert them to Qi wireless charging and for some there's the aftermarket solutions to allow Qi wireless charging. If you can be more specific on the phone you in mind we can point you in the right direction.
will it fit a 5s?,"Yes! They are the same size. :) you're going to love it! Promise, no regrets here. :)"
Will ShockSuit fit into a charger like an IHome without removing the case? I want the bottom ports accessible.,"No it will not. However the case come in 2 pieces.. If you just remove the outer shock suit, it will fit. You can't beat it for the price."
will this case fit an iphone 5s?,Absolutely. Have it on my 5S and love it!
i recently purchased this case for my iphone 5s and the right side sticks out could my screen protector be causing this?,I don't think the screen protector will be the cause. Mine does the same but doesn't bother me
Will this case fit an iPhone 5c?,I bought this case when I had my I phone 5. Tried the case on the 5c and didn't fit. This case does fit the 5s and that's what i upgraded to.
What is the best way to prevent air bubbles? Any suggestions?,"This phone case doesn't cause air bubbles. I don't use a screen protector, I just place my iPhone 5 in this case which comes with a plastic screen cover already built into the case."
does the shock suit slide in and out of pockets easily?,Very easily no hangups at all. And comes with a built in screen protector.
How much grip do the back and sides of the case have? Are they rubberized or do they have more of a smooth/slick (i.e. not much grip) feel to them?,"The majority of the case is rubber, the only hard plastic is the white portion that is shown in the picture. With that said, the case does not grip the phone well, it was a little to big for my phone and it felt as though the phone would rattle around in the case. I do not believe the case was loose enough to fall off but if you are looking for protection for your phone this would not be my first choice."
Is this the great case for s3 or s4?,"I've owned multiple cases for my S3 since purchasing it, and this is the only one which I could recommend. I wouldn't buy any other at any price. It has fully protected the phone on sever drops. It is far superior to the otterbox cases, as I have been through 2 of them."
"You said the buttons and ports are covered, what does that mean? Is there no cut-outs on the case for the buttons and ports to connect to?",There are cut outs. They are only partially covered and absolutely functional. This case is my favorite! I hope this helps.
"Does this trickle charge once battery gets full, or does it make the phone repeatedly cycle between charging and discharging w/ screen coming back on?","There was an issue with the device and it has been addressed. If you purchased it with the issue, all you have to do is call customer support and they will send you a replacement. I was one of the original backers of the project and they just sent me a new replacement (they finally fixed it). It works great now. No more waking me up at night"
why so expensive?,Worth every penny. I love this charger no messing with cables at night. If I need to use my phone I just put it rack back the charger and no worries.
Does it work with Samsung Galaxy S5?,"As everyone has mentioned, yes, but you need the wireless battery cover. I order this one: Samsung Wireless Charging Cover for Samsung Galaxy S5 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ITI24EK/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1)"
Is it 110-220v input?,"Labeled 100-240V 50-60Hz and .3 amp the blades are the typical 110-120v US congfiuration. Repeating, the output is 12 v @ .75 amp - explaining the non-USB power cord."
How many coils does this have?,"Not sure but my Nexus 5 and Nexus 7 only charge reliably while horizontal. The Nexus 5 would heat up often if not placed just right in the vertical position. After a couple of times of not getting it right in the middle of the night, I just started using it horizontally and it works fine."
"It looks like this is designed for portrait phone positioning, will it charge if the phone is placed in landscape?",ABSOLUTELY ...EVEN WORKS IN MY LEATHER SLEEVE
Is this at least a 2 amp charger?,Tylt's YouTube video states that it charges phones at a rate that is equivalent to a 1.0A normal (5V) charger.
Does this work well with the Nexus 6? (Please do not answer unless you have actually used a Nexus 6 with this charger),Yes it does. I use it with my nexus 6 every night. Works great
Does it work with HTC One?,I beleave that the HTC One doesn't have the requirements to be able to work with this device but im not sure. But if your phone has QI there shouldn't be any problem.
Will this charge more than one device simultaneously?,It isn't really designed for that - they probably wouldn't fit.
Does the phone fit in the holster kickstand facing outward?,no. it doesn't. only facing inside. but as far as video viewing and what not the kickstand on the case itself works for that. they probably make it that way for added protection of the phone so you don't damage the screen while it's in the holster.
is it water proof,No it is not waterproof. There is no sealing action to the case.
"Top description says it's a black case, but the main product description says it's colored zebra pattern. Which one is this?",All black. Really good case.
How do I know what model I have I have a SCH-1545 UD Galaxy S4. Will it fit??,yes
Will this fit the Samsung S4 Active? It is a bit bigger than the Samsung S4,If its a little bigger it probably will not fit. It fits snug on the standard s4
any warranty on this case - in case the phone breaks even being inside the case or the cover blet clip itself breaks causing phone damage??,No warranty you might have 10 days for return i am not sure without reading the info but i have not had a problem with mine
Does this come with screen protector,No and honestly I wouldn't get this type of case. Very awkward to hold because there are so many ridges.
Will This work with the Active model? it is 5.5 inches long.,"I have a Galaxy S4, my understanding is that the active difference should be that is resistant to water and other things. But you should verify sizes at the Samsung or cell phone company that offer the comparison."
Is the charger 110v-220v?,the power supply is 100-240
Can the charging cable be changed? because the one pictured has a US socket and most of my chargers are UK sockets,No the charger it comes with can't be changed but you can purchase a us wall socket with a UK outlet so your able to plug in the US charger.
would this work for the samsung galaxy s6,Yes it works
do I need to purchase anything else besides the tilt to charge my note 4?,"I don't own a Note 4 myself, but a quick Google search seems to indicate that the Note 4 does not have built-in wireless charging. You'd need to purchase a wireless charging case or install a wireless charging card."
Some cases vary in thickness. Has anyone experienced issues with charging due to a thicker case? Such as an Otterbox Defender or Lifeproof?,"Go to tylt vu's web page and look there. If you can't find the answer, call their very good Customer Service desk."
"I have a Samsung S5, I know it is not QI enabled. I have found a replacement battery cover with a wireless card. Will my phone work with this door?","It probably will. I have a Note IV and it uses the same setup, as well as an alternate setup with a Spigen case and a wireless card/sticker over the existing battery. Be warned that at least for me, the phone gets very hot while in the stand and I'm hesitant to leave it in for very long."
The red error light comes on everytime i place my phone on the charger. It does not charge my phone. I have a samsung s3 mini... is it my phone or the charger?,Check the position of the phone
Have you had any problems charging once it reaches 95% charge. It seems like at that % it wil stop then reconnect and stop again and so on.,"I have had no issues. Usually when my phone is at 95% or higher battery, the wireless charging notification sound will not play. What type of phone do you have?"
is it compatible with iPhone 5 and 5s,yeah if you buy an iqi. http://www.amazon.com/iQi-Mobile-Wireless-Charging-Receiver/dp/B00H0DDVBU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1398491610&sr=8-1&keywords=iqi
"If I put an NFC tag on it, will that interfere with the charging?","I would imagine if the NFC tag was on the back of your phone, then it might indeed interfere. I would guess if you just have one attached to your phone, but say, hanging off the side, it would be fine."
Is it waterproof?,No its not.. that's about the only down side to this case. Other than that its great. Also I clean mine about once a week since I work in dirty conditions..
Does this case fit Galaxy S 4 Active,I don't believe so but I have te regular S4 so I haven't tried.
does this come with a holster,yes it does
Does it work with galaxy S4 active?,"No, s4 and s4 active are two completely different devices."
Does anyone else have problems with an echo while phone is in case. People I am talking to can hear it (I can't) it was so annoying I had to stop using the case?,No echo with mine. Try turning the call volume down a little
Does this come with the clip on holster for your belt?,Yes
Can I use this with an apple 5 ?,"not sure i dont have the apple, the side holders on each side opens up wide the close when released to fit your .........phone.....................She"
will this fit the Samsung Galaxy Note II?,It might be too small for the Note. It fits S4 pretty snuggly.
will this fit htc one?,"Wouldnt know for sure, I use it with a Galaxy S3. I suggest you compare your HTC to an S3, take in consideration that you can easily adjust several sizes and widths. I'm sure that if HTC one has similar dimensions, more or less, this holder will do the job for you."
Does the stylus fit in the case?,No
can this phone case work with the posh 5.8 ?,"sorry, no."
Will this work with all versions of the Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3?,"Yes, this case will work for all mega 6.3 inch size phones. If you have a different sized mega then you will need a different case."
How does the stylus work with the phone since it does not come with a s-pen?,Yes
Does it fit over the extended life battery,It fit over the whole phone with the factory battery the best one I ever got heavy duty we protect phone
does it fit Samsung galaxy s4,No. This is much bigger than the S4
does it make phone too bulky,No it doesn't
Does it come with Legos,No Legos. Just the case
"I have the Zagg Invisible shield HD on my phone, will this case still fit with the shield on?","I am not sure. But if the invisible shield is very thin just like any adhesive protective film to prevent scratches on the screen of the iPhone, the LEGO case should fit. If it does not work, you can return it if you order from Amazon.com. Amazon is known for their very generous return policy!"
will it fit itouch 5,My guess is probably not. I do not have an iTouch but I know they are significantly thinner than the iPhone. It fits the iPhone 5 perfectly so I believe it would be very loose and awkward on an iTouch.
Will the LEGO&reg; Builder Case fit the iPhone 5c?,"No, it will not. It will only fit the iPhone 5 and 5s."
does it work for iphone 5c,No. I also have iPhone 5 c and it will not fit on it
It seems new and nice idea but is it comfortable in hand? I`ll wait the reviewers to see,"Yes, although the case might seem bumpy, the case doesn't stab your hand or anything. Overall, it is pretty smooth."
Is the front bottom edge enclosed with port openings (i.e. does the front face rim go all the way around)?,There is a U shaped cut in the bottom of the rim. So the bottom face edge of the iPhone is unprotected. The rim is slightly proud of the glass so the glass is protected when faced down.
Is the inside of the case rubber or plastic?,Plastic. Only the red rim is rubber.
"About the Lego nobs, how dirty do they get through use? I would imagine that they would get black rims or something of this sort.",I've never experienced any of the conditions you described. If the knobs were to get nasty it would be very easy to remove the case and wash in warm soapy water and a brush. Hope this helps!
Does this case hurt you if you step on it?,It is pretty safe if you are the type of guy that doesn't like feet and would rather walk on hands :)
"When, oh when, will Belkin make one for the iPhone 6+? I had this case in glow-in-the-dark white for my iPhone 5 and loved it.","We're excited as you are, Linda, but no word on the availability of the LEGO Case Shield for iPhone 6 yet. Updates will be posted on our website as soon as the information is available."

Depending on the app you use for ""dock"" mode, the settings will be different."
my s4 has bluetooth. if the phone is in the dock will the blue still work.,it depends on what you are asking. Will the audio work over bluetooth? Or will the phone work over bluetooth? Most of the functionality of the dock is in the app. Depending on your use it may or may not do what you want. I used a 3rd party app to manage the bluetooth called SoundAbout. I would do a google search for Samsung Galaxy S4 and SoundAbout. Good luck.

I'm unclear here. Can this adapter plug into a 30 pin docking station thus converting it to a lighting pin connection? I'm not clear on the purpose of the item.,It's so it will fit on lifeproof it's lightning to lightning
"Does this enable full functionality, such as audio/video?",Yes it does
I have a dock already for an iphone 5. So if i hook this into my iphone with lifeproof case on it is just an extension? Or is it an iphone 4 to 5 pin?,This is just an extension. Since the life proof case is so deep where the plug would fit.
Is this a genuine LifeProof adapter? I don't see this item on LifeProof's website!,"Yes, it is a genuine lifeproof product."

"Do you have to buy a Card every Month to keep your Phone Service Activated? Also, are there any Additional Hidden Fees, or is it $20 a Month TOTAL??","I am not sure if there is a ""card."" $20 gives you 30 days of service. You can pay up a few months in advance or go to your local AT&T store each month and pay $20 on your account. We pay monthly because the service is still new, and we're not sure if we'll experience problems. There are zero additional fees because we activated our unit at our local store as a PREPAID account. We paid in advance for 30 days of service and did not allow them to bill us. Customers who have activated online seem to receive bills with fees. Account must be PREPAID."
Does the phome have a battery back up for power outages?,Yes Approximately 3 hours talk time and 25 hours standby time in the event of a power outage.

These calling features are included also at no charge: 3-way calling, call waiting, call forwarding with no per minute charge if activated, caller number ID. My at&t box works perfect with clear calls. I would highly recommend going with at&t, no complaints."
Can I use this with my Panasonic DECT cordless phone?,Yes . The unit has a standard plug in for corded and cordless phones. The unit works great with my Panasonic DECT phone.
We have 4 cordless phones in the house. Will we be able to use any/all of them and they'll work or do you need to use the one that is connected?,The wireless home phone box has two RJ11 out. Connect your cordless base and it will connect to all the phones as long as they are all connected to the same base.
Can the antenna be extended for better connectivity?,Mine has no extension capability.

How long will it take to get my Verizon land-line phone number transferred to AT&amp;T Wireless Home Phone?,"We had a Verizon landline, and it only took 2 days to transfer our number."
I bought one and either I threw the charger instructions away or there were none in the box? Does the blue light ever go out?,"No. Blue light shows power on (NO battery in) OR full charge (battery in). Light turns red when battery is charging. Turns back to blue when battery full. Interestingly enough, as the battery is charging, you might see a combination of red & blue (purple) light as the battery gets close to full charge. But when the battery is in place (correctly) and the light is blue, the battery is fully charged."
Can I use it for my note 3 N900?,It has worked great for my Samsung Note 3. I use two back ups and it makes a world of difference. Charger is kinda cheap feeling but works just fine.
"Does this external charger work with the 6,400 mAh battery as well?","It should work just fine as the charger outputs the same, but it will take twice as long. Charge the battery to 90% in your phone and the rest with the external charger to see if it stops charging when it's full, just to be sure."
Would it still fit into a samsung note 3 cover which I currently have - if not do you suggest new cover to protect the phone and which one,"Need a new cover , hyp sells em"
"I just purchased the Note 3 from Verizon SM-N900v, will this extended battery work? Also, I beleive the SIM card is NFC.",Yes. I have that model from Verizon. I do not know about the NFC. This battery is great but I don't know the best case to use for it.
Will I lose any bars signal strength?,Not at all I never had a problem with it!
"If I buy this battery, where can I buy the ""hyperion case"" case for it?",The case you see in the photo comes with it. It's nothing special but the battery is larger than the original.
Could someone please tell me using this battery; its performance after one year are you still getting good charge/usage of two days?,"Yes , I still used this battery after one year and its very good quality ."
Can any body tell me how big the Note 3 is with battery and case? Such as 2x the thickness as the bare phone. or an exact messurement? Thanks,It's about twice as thick but the big part is the weight but you get used to it real quick
How much thicker does the phone become with the new back cover compared to before?,not too much but I will still prefer be a little slimmer
Does it work with t-mobile note 3?,I don't see why it wouldn't work. I've never personally tried it but regardless it's the same phone just different cell reception. Hope this helps!
Does the extanded back cover interfere with cases? I want a stronger battery but I want to be able to continue to use my cases.,Yes it does interfere with a standard case. You must buy the hyperion case.
Im confused if I buy this do I have to buy a completely seperate case or if I buy this am I good?,No. Your all good bc the back that comes with it is perfect to use as a case. Its a great battery and great build quality
Is there a more protective cover that can fit over this one?,Unfortunately the only covers available are the ones from Hyperion but I have dropped my phone a couple times and there is no visible damage
can this battery fit in my note 3 phone case with out the case it comes with...?,You must use the one provided with your order.
Is there an external charger for this?,Yes but you have to but it for about six dollars it is a universal charger
will this fit in ProClip Note 3 phone holder?,"I really can't say as I do not have a holder for my phone, yet. My jacket has a zipped pocket over my left breast area and I keep my phone in that pocket. I can say I am extremely happy with this battery."
"Since this battery increases the volume, is it correct to assume that the special ""wireless charging cover"" would not work with this battery?","I have this product and if it fits like the original cover, I can say no, it will not. Hoping Hyperion would come out with a wireless charging cover to compliment the double battery. I'd be so happy if they did."
can someone please tell me if this bttery is &gt;&gt;&gt; nfc&lt;&lt;&lt; for sure 100% i need to know..&amp; hoping it works,My battery's NFC works just fine.

Please clarify?","Almost all of the huge after-market batteries are really just multiple batteries in a same housing, wired together so they basically act as one battery."
Has anyone found a good case that fits after this is installed?,Not yet but if you r on the fence about buying it I suggest that u do. I can not kill this battery if I tried it last all day which is all I ask.
Does the indicator LED light go off once battery stick is fully charged? or how do I know when its fully charged?,yes
will this work on Note 2?,I have a samsung galaxy 3 and it works fine. You just can't charge the stick for too long though. It gets pretty hot.
Where is the LED Status Guide. I don't see any red light indicating stick is being charged.,You push the small button on the end next to the USB port. The red light should come on if it is charging.
Does the red light go off when the battery stick is completely charged ?,Yes.
y does my mpto stick keep shutting itself off before my phone is charged??,Contact the manufacturer
"Yes, it was powered on. Turns out Apple has blocked 3rd party cables. Is there a workaround anyone knows of?",With the power pack I haven't had a problem charging my apple products with the battery stick.
"Why can't I get this to work with my iPhone 5? I have fully charged it, plugged it into the iPhone using the proper adapter, and nothing.","Did you turn it on? there is a little button on the top beside the USB plug that has to be clicked to turn on(should be a blue light indicating power on). Click it once to turn the power on, hold the button for the flashlight. Hope this helps."
does this work with the new 5S and 5C,Yes
How many hours of charge time is on the stick when it's fully charged,"I would measure it in percent, it gives 80 percent of a full charge if you dont use the phone at all whole charging it. So maybe 3.5 hours of use...?"
how do you know it is charged? does the light go off?,"I just got 2 of these on sale including all the adapters. I charge the Stick with wall charger that's included because it charges in about 30 minutes. There's a Red light that comes on when the Stick itself is charging. The light does go out when the stick is fully charged. Then when you plug the Stick into your Phone/other device there's a Blue light that indicates it's charging your Phone/device. When your Phone/device is fully charged the blue light goes out. I'm not quite sure yet what they're referring to when they say there's an LED battery level indicator, unless they're referring to the little ""battery icon"" that shows up on the ipone that tells you how much power is left in your phone. It charged my iphone very quickly too. Both are pretty new, so I'm hoping these quick charges continue for awhile. There's nothing in the tiny bit of instructions that indicates the stick can be overcharged, so I'm also hoping that since the lights go out when charges are ""full"" that nothing will overcharge. It's also nice to have the extra Wall Charger (with a USB port) to use with multiple devices, since practically everything for iphones are sold separately, i.e. the extra Lightning-USB cable does not come with the plug in wall charger. Wall chargers always charge all devices faster than charging from a USB port on your computer laptop. I like ""Quick"" !!"
Does this work with an iPhone 6?,Yes
How do you charge the stick?,wall charger comes with it.
I'm looking at this as a gift for my Mom but she has a Pantech flip phone. Not a smartphone in other words. Will it work with that kind of phone?,I hated this product in general. Broke on me after less than a week.
"if the battery is depleted on the phone, can you plug this in and use the phone while the stick is charging it?",You definitely can!
If I have an iPhone 5s do I need the bundle or just the stick? What is included in the bundle,"It looks like the bundle includes the Apple Lightning connector, which you would need to connect to your iPhone 5S. This is what I found: With bundle: Nokia, micro USB, mini USB, Apple Lightning adapter, iPhone/iPod 30-pin connector, and PSP 3.0mm Without bundle: Nokia, micro USB, mini USB, iPhone/iPod 30-pin connector, and PSP 3.0m"
Do you need the cords when you use the stick to make a call on an uncharged phone? Buying as gift and know nothing!,"You will need to have the phone plugged into the ""stick"" if it is an uncharged phone. You may have the phone plugged in while calling. The ""stick"" will not charge the phone and charge itself at the same time. It will be a great gift, I love mine."
Will this charge an IPad Air?,No.
"I have an iPhone 4s. Do I need to buy the bundle, or will the stick only suffice?",You need the bundle. The stick only is micro USB which works for a Droid or other non iPhone devices
Does it charge Samsung galaxy note 3?,Don't know what it can or can't charge since the one I bought started smoking and caught fire when plugged into an I-phone.
Can I use this with the I phone 5,After the last upgrade on iphone 5 mine stopped working...
Use on Samsung phone?,"Here's the thing....when I ordered mine, it came with all of the adapters shown which DOES include an adapter to charge a Samsung phone. I have seen a couple people who have purchased these after I bought mine and they've said that they do not come with all of the shown adapters. So unfortunately I can't tell you 'Yes' or 'No' for sure. Maybe message the seller if you can?"

Can you use the phone while it is charging?,"Yes, absolutely. I do it all the time."
How long is the charger cord that comes with it?,12 1/2 inches
"With the adapters, will it charge a Kindle and/or Kindle Fire (I have both)?",Yes
Will it work with the Samsung Galaxy S3 or S4?,I comes with several different adapters for various phones. It should work.

"How long does the Mota stay charged without being used? I read it takes 2-1/2 hrs to charge it, but not how long the stick remains charged without using it.","Hi Linda, Thank you for your message. MOTA uses the same high quality battery as the iPhone and iPod. If Battery Stick is not used, it will hold most of its charge for few weeks.

Do it have a build-in screen protection cover?,Yes
Is this case the same as a Otterbox ?,I've never had an Otterbox. Probably it's not the same. But it is really durable and solid. I've used it for months and it's held up to and protected my phone from drops and damage. I really like it.
Would this fit the Mega 5.8?,I think so it might be a bit larger
is there any need for screen savers with this case,I don't use one at all and my screen has no scratches.
will it chick on to a belt,"Yes, if you buys phone case with a belt bclop,"
Would this product fit the Sprint Mega?,Yep
how do u know when the case is fully charged?,Light turns and stays green on the bottom part of powerbank
Will this fit the HTC ONE S?,Yes
is it good quality,The quality is good but it is not really 3800 mAH.. Only charges my phone from 0 to 50% and my phone's battery is a 2100mAH... Kinda disappointing
how much percentage does this charge up to?,Idk mine only worked once get the Mophie
"i see its for HTC one M7. is that a different model of the HTC one? because i believe i just have the HTC one, will this work for that?","This works for my HTC One! I bought it specifically for this purpose. It works great for a short time! A couple of hours. Recharging it is timely, but great in a pinch. Fits nicely into my purse."
Will this work for a HTC One X LTE?,"Yeahhh,"
Is this rechargeable?,Yes it is
Can I charge the case and my phone simultaneously?,"Yes, you can charge up both the case and the phone at the same time."
My DF33T speaks Chinese voice prompts. Can it be changed to speak English?,"Yes, there is an option, have to press ""Hold"" button for it to cycle thru the languages but doesn't work all the time, took me a few tries."

windscreen for voyager legend,"Dear it has double mic noise cancelling,hope you like it!"
Which is the best enviroment to fit these properly ? In closed doors ? In a bathroom with the hot shower on ?,"I went to the cell phone store and had them install it on my phone. Before he put the shield on my phone, I observed the person spray the display with some kind of lubricant. Frankly I do not know what it was. Immediately after he peeled the plastic protector from the shield and carefully placed it on the moisturized display. He then used a plastic edger maybe 2 or 3 inches wide and worked any/all bubbles out. I suppose I could buy a plastic edger and find out the spray they used at the store. But then again I'm glad I took it to the cell phone store and just had them do it for me."
Where do I go to claim for the lifetime replacement warranty?,I need my replacement
Would this screen protector fit the Samsung galaxy mega 5.8,I don't think so. The mega is an inch bigger than the s3
does this screen protector hard enough to prevent phone from getting screen cracked,there is no screen protector that does this that I know of. Glass breaks and the plastic stuff is just not strong enough. All it would do is keep glass from falling out in many pieces
Does this go over the battery door? I just ordered a phone that has no back plate and am looking for a protective case that will substitute for a back,This case will do just that. It fits very snuggly on the phone.
Does this case provide coverage for any breakage that might occur while it is in use (such as that offered by the Otter)?,"I didn't know they offered any but nonetheless it is a Great Case! I wouldn't suggest throwing it across the room into a brick wall, but for normal slips and falls no problem, lives up to its name!"
does this come with a screen protector,No.
Does this product have cut-outs for the on/off button and volume control?,They are not cut out but they are rubber and they work really well. I havent had any issues with it everytime I press it it works
does this have a belt clip?,No belt clip. It works as a stand as in the pic. Also the knobby part peels off to make a more low profile skin basically. It is a good case for the Mega.
will this case fit the regular Mega phone,What is regular mega? I have the galaxy mega and it fits nicely. Its a huge phone though. What do you have?
"The battery has three contacts and, from the picture, the charger only has two. How do you know which to connect to? Or is there a 3 connector vers?",Usually you use the two outside terminals or whichever ones are marked + and -. Polarity does not seem to matter to the charger.
it seems to have the total screen lit--how do I tell if the battery is charged???,"When you charge it, it will go by percentage rate of charge and when it hits 100 percent it will show it. It will look like a battery when fully charged with the percentage signs in there. You might have to play with the prongs to get it start charging. When you slide the battery in make sure one is on the plus and minus areas on the battery contact points."
The LCD lights up and displays the percentage but it won't charge the battery. Any suggestions?,"Honestly, I am not sure. If you purchased the item from us and think it is defective, please let me know and we'll send you a replacement."
Does this charger take a long time to fully charge the battery? Like Samsung Note 3 battery.,Yes. I have a sumsung galaxy 4 active and it takes a good 4-5 hours.
will it work with the Kyocera torque I noticed three prongs in the phone itself that touch the battery when the battery is in the phone,Normally only 2 of the 3 prongs make contact to charge the battery. The prongs can be slid to the proper location to make contact. Once in a while two side by side prongs work but most of the time the two outside prongs do the work.
"do the battery leads stay in place or do they move easily? Using a similar charger, the leads slip and move very easily, hard to keep lined up",It stays in place because the left side is like a slider door that has a spring and keeps it in place so when you plug it into the wall it doesn't fall out because of the grip of the springy door i never had any troubles with that part my only down fall is it takes it a whole day to charge your battery its a very slow charger hope I answered your question.
Does this work with a Wacom Li-on battery from the wireless kit? Specs are 3.7 V 1150mAh 4.3 Wh Li-on battery. Does the charger adjust to this type?,"It charges it to about 85%, works as good as a power bank. It never gets to 100%."
Does this work with a Samsung Rugby III?,"yes, it works."
I have a samsung eb555157va battery (for a samsung infuse 4g smartphone) to charge. will this battery fit your charger?,The prongs are adjustable so I would guess it would. I would check with the manufacturer to be sure.
1)can it can charge samsung note 2 spare battery and also the phone by usb in the same time?..2)very fast charging?,"I haven't tried the USB charge, so I don't know about that. It is NOT very fast charging, though. In my experience it always takes longer than using the regular phone charger. Also it never charges to 100%."
would this item work in Jamaica,Yes it will
how does this differ from the Q10. I will be using this only in the US and am an At&amp;t cutomer. thanks for any info or advise.,"There are some hardware differences such as camera, display, processor clock, build quality, etc.. You need to assess what each means to you, however for those of us who are on budget, they may not be that important. Q5 is a great option for the price and mine works well in US with T-Mobile"
"hey guys I just bought this phone...here, with intentions of sending it to the Caribbean. Would it work there? I was looking for it to say GSM ...!","Hey Karen. It is working just fine in Poland, so I guess it's gonna work in Caribbean too."

when charging the battery pack will the red light turn to a different color when fully charged?,I returned mine because it never reached a full charge :(
How many recharges/uses will this little compact provide?,"I have no idea. It comes with no instructions and no buttons whatsoever. I don't even know how long the charges last or how long it takes to completely charge up? I do know, I've had it for over a month and it works fine. So far so good. I charge it until the LED light changes from red to blue. When I connect it to my smart phone it charges my phone fine. I've repeated the process several times and so far so good."

how do you charge the charger,Flip the cord around and use a charging block in the wall
Does it tell you when it needs to charge?,Yes it goes from red to blue..but it doesn't stay charge for long. Once you charge something you must recharge the mini.
I did not find its dimensions on the listing. What are its dimensions?,"it is about 4 inches by 2 inches, and 2 inches deep. it is pretty small yet i can easily spot it when i look in my purse. Does that make sense?"
does it work with any phone,As long as your phone has the small usb plug in
Does it charge just like it is shown in the picture? Or do you have to hook it up to a computer?,Yes it charge like in the photo.. yet your instructions on the box doesn't say it tirns burn when charged. Nor how long the battery life before it need to charge.
Does it fit the Iphone 5s?,Yes
Does this case fit the iPhone 5s as well as the iPhone 5 or is there a different case for the 5s,I bought this set for my mother in December and I was told the case is 5/5s compatible.
"on the ipro site, it has a kit for the samsung galaxy s4, will this one fit it, or is this only for the iphone?","The lens mount is part of the case, so I think the lenses will fit on either phone's case. The cases however must be different due to the shape of each phone. In short, I don't think the iPhone 5(s) kit will fit on a Galaxy S4."
could you fit like 2-3 cards and maybe some cash? thank you in advance,"I've had this case and it's held up amazing considering how many times I've dropped it. I've fit almost 5 cards in there, with some force, but it defiantly fits! I've gotten my second one and still like it. Money is a little harder because when it's folded it gets thicker, so it make for less room for cards."

Does this fit a key and 1 card?,yes if key is not a big thick one
can the pen ink and rubber tip can be replace?,"The ink could be replaced. I don't know if the rubber tip could be replaced because it has a hole in the middle where the tip of the ink pen comes through. They're great pens, especially for the price. They write very well."
Will they work with a Kindle Fire?,Yes they do and I love mine because I can write with it as well as use it on the Kindle Fire.
does the pen come through the rubber,"Yes, there is a hole in the tip. This thing works great. Pen quality is just so-so but great for meeting notes."
How long are they?,"5-7/8"""
Will they work with a Samsung Series 7 (slate)?,"I would presume they work with almost any touch screen, but haven't tried them on Samsung Series 7. They do work on my Nook, Galaxy S5, and an old iphone 4."

Does this Stylus work on Tracfone,It should. But I use it for my Kindle.

Has anyone tried to charge this from a wall charger? How does it work afterwards? Any difference in charge time between comp and wall?,"I've charged it from the wall. I find the unit quite ""funky"" the lights stay red, you can't tell if charging is complete. The charge doesn't last long enough for emergency's. Just a weird little unit. I don't know if mine ever worked correctly. I've pretty much written it off as a ""my bad."""
Does this work with Motorola Razr M?,"I'm pretty sure that this works with any ddevice with a usb 2.0/3.0 plug. I've only used with a bluetooth speaker, AT&T Samsung S4 and Verizon iPhone 5. It works great!"
"What does the ""Unlocked International Version"" mean??","It means that your phone won't have loaded all the useless software and configurations from carriers. You will also have access to some configurations or actions that could be blocked by some carriers. It also means (sometimes) different specs, usually better specs. You shouldn't have any issue to use your phone with your regular sim card and you would be able to change carries by just changing the sim card. -elvaldo"
would this phone work in Trinidad,"I do not know, I live in Venezuela and works perfectly here"
"Why doesn't this work with Verizon, Sprint, or MetroPCS?","Hi Victoria, this mobile phone doesn't work with Verizon, Sprint or MetroPCS because this mobile use GSM, which is the method that use sim cards. Verizon and the other companies use CDMA that is a totally different standard that doens't use sim cards and therefor is not compatible with GSM."

Does it work 4G in any network??,"No, this phone was made only for at&t so if you are not an att customer you will not be able to use 4G on it. But if you are a Tmobile customer you will see a H on top of the status bar which stands for 3G but the fact that tmobile does not have 3G network it will run like a 4G network you won't see the diffrence because it runs like 4G network. For other carrier if you see a H it stands for 3G except for tmobile, and if you see an E it stands for 2G it is the slowest network. I will send u more information if you tell me which is your network provider."

Does This item for sale is the charger only or includes the Blue Tooth?,"This item includes the headset, wall charger, 3 sets of earbuds in different sizes. there is a basic user manual but no fancy packaging, car charger or storage container. quite a deal for the price. it's a standard mini USB plug but be sure the voltages match if you plan on using a 3rd party car charger."
what is meant by bulk packaging?,Basically you get it in a plain cardboard box. It isn't going to have any fancy plastic or labeling on it at all. Still the same product inside though.
"Hi, will it work with Ipad Air?",I'm pretty sure this will work with everything with blue tooth it worked with ps3
Is it an original Motorola or the Chinese version? I don't see the Motorola logo in the picture and the adjustable strap...,"It is an original genuine motorola refurbished unit.

"***HELP*** I was using with iphone without problems. I pressed ignore (in error) wNow, it wont pair at all :( help please-","From what I know, you can hold down the SCAN button on your headsets (which is the big square button in the middle of the control panel) until it makes a sound which means its detecting and then press SCAN on your phone at the same time so that it can pair with one another. That should work."
"I am a iPhone user, does this active SIRI when you keep pressed a button?","yes, although you have to train yourself to get the timing right when pressing the button because the same button also controls the battery check, power, and music pause/play."
What is the Bluetooth version on this ear buds. I have a nexus 5 and its equipped with Bluetooth 4.0 and specs show 4.0 is very energy efficient.,It's Bluetooth v2.1 so you won't get the benefits of BLE.
Can these be used while plugged into the charger?,No. They cannot.
how are they for running? do they fit snug in ear so won't fall out?,"After having them for a while, they are very good for running. But the trick is to have the stabilization tab set for your ears. I always have to readjust them for the perfect fit. As a matter of fact I just got through cutting grass and sweated pretty good. No problem with them staying in my ears. If you get them once you and play with them a while you will figure out what angle to put the stabilizer in for the perfect fit. You will also know when you got a good fit because they sound awsome! They are best I have had so far. I have LG730 and they always have a tendency to fall out after sweating, so I stopped wearing them for workouts. I think these are a good buy."
"Does the sound skips and cuts when you don't have you phone on your hand (but on the table) outside? I know it doesn't inside, but outside?",Do turn off wifi. Searching wifi bothers blue tooth connection.
"simple question, hard to explain. are the volume levels on the headphones and the device (ie phone, tablet, etc) linked or separate?",They're linked. Changing the volume settings on the headphones will adjust the volume of the connected device.
Can you mute the mic from the inline controls?,With due respect the other two comments are wrong. Press volume up and volume down at the same time to mute or unmute. Directions are in the manual on page 9 and it works on mine.
will two pairs of earbuds pick up tunes from my samsung galaxy s2 simultaneously? would like to use these on my harley for me and a passenger.,You can pair the ear buds to a few different devices but I think you can have only one blue tooth attached to a device at any given time. Other wise I have no idea
"Has anyone tried using these when running/jogging? I'm wondering if they stay in, are comfortable, etc. Thanks!","Yes they stay in, they don't fall out easily at all. Plus they are water proof. They fit really well when running"
I just bought a pair - I think the ear pieces are too big (yes I have the smallest ones on) as I am having trouble keeping them in my ears?,I had problems with fit at first too. I rotated the ear pieces downward and made sure to tuck the clear stabilizers inside my ears. This made for a better fit. Since then no problems.
What kind of charger does this use?,A regular micro USB...One comes with the ear buds in the box...
How are these for phone calls?,"They work as well as my Motorola earpiece but with a longer range. That is why I now only use the Plantronics earbuds, especially since I usually have them on anyway for music. I can hear and be heard clearly even while flying kites on a windy day with family. I pretty much never leave home without them."
Is it compatible with Nokia Lumia 720?,As long as your phone has Bluetooth it should be.
Having issues. There is no bass to any music. Can this be adjusted or are mine not working. Just bought a month ago.....,"There's no adjustment in the headphones, but it's possible that your device is filtering the audio somehow. The best way to test would be to try pairing the headphones with a different device. If the problem persists, you probably have a hardware failure."
Do these work with an IPhone 5S??,Yes.
Supposedly the sound quality of BT earbuds are inferior to wired buds of similar price range. Relative to the stock Apple buds how do these compare?,"Well, until you added the ""stock Apple buds"" (or any stock earbuds) I was going to say these are not quite as good (as higher end wired headphones), but they are every bit as good as the stock earbuds that come with most phones for music, and FAR superior to stock headset for phone calls. I don't think you'll be disappointed!"
What is the warranty period ? I bought used and one of the earphones stopped working after 3 months,One year limited warranty
"Anyone use these with Galaxy S4? Since it's BT, I can't access all SoundAlive options from my phone so these don't sound good at all.",Sent mine back they are the worst head phones on Amazon.
Has anyone tried one bud in and one out? Sometimes I like to keep one ear open (to traffic etc). Thanks!,"Yes, I have. Unfortunately, the earbuds are so heavy that the one that's out causes the other one to pull really bad."
"If you get these without the charging case, how do you charge the earbuds?",The earbuds come with a wall charger(basically a cellphone charger) that plugs into the side of one of the ear pieces.
earbuds fall out,"I have not had that problem I found the correct fit with the included tips and shook my head from side to side and they did not fall out at all,and they feel nice cause there is no loop going over your ear much more comfortable"
I can't get it connected to my mini iPad. Please advise,"Try this: 1. Power off the headphones 2. On the iPad Mini, go to Settings, Bluetooth 3. Power on the headphones, continue holding the button until the light blinks red and blue (pairing mode) 4. The headphones will appear under Bluetooth as PLT_BBTGO2, tap it to pair 5. Once the pairing is complete, the status will show as ""Connected"" I just tried this on my iPhone running IOS7 and it worked perfectly, should work the same for an iPad. Give it a try with these instructions."
I know it is meant to use for a device with bluetooth. I want to use it with my desktop computer which does not come with bluetooth. Any suggestion?,Install a USB blue tooth transceiver.
can you go in the shower with these without damaging them?,I wouldn't try it but I don't know what happened
can I use multiple devices at same time?,"Not sure what you mean? You can pair more than one device, but no you can't use more than 1 device at a time."
Can you use them while they are charging?,"No, the Bluetooth actually unpairs when you put it on the charger."
Can I use this product to make calls?,"Yes... the only thing that I dislike is that it completely blocks out all outside sound which can also be a positive, but necessary to get the full bass. I also accidently put these things through the wash and once they dried out worked perfectly."
Which is better Go2 or Jaybird freedom ???,"Never used the Jaybirds, but the one advantage they have over the Backbeat GO 2's is nearly twice the battery life (up to 8 hours vs 4.5). Since I love the fit, functionality, and sound of the BBG2's, battery life is the only downside...but not enough to make me regret my purchase. If I could do it all over, I wouldn't change a thing."
What is the range of the headphones.,"Plantronics states the operating range as ""Up to 33 feet from phone or tablet"". My experience has been that they begin to drop out at about 30-35 feet."
How are these for talking on the phone?,"Sounds good for the other person. But for you, since they are in-ear you can hardly hear yourself so that's the only problem. End up talking extra loud"
what is the range in feet,Abou 5ft I would guess but don't know for sure. Hope it helps
what is the range in feet,The audio quality begins to drop about 15 feet away. The actual device stops being constantly-connected after approximately 50 feet. The device will disconnect between 60 and 75 feet away.
Are there ear loops available for the Backbeat Go 2?,No you need the backbeat go fit for that
Are these earphones compatible w Ipod nano?,Afaik ipod Nanos don't have bluetooth connectivity so no. But any bluetooth media player will work with these.
can u use this with the iphone 5 ?,Yup - I use it with my 5S and did with my old 5 too
How do I pair this with OS X Mavericks? my laptop couldn't detect it.,"Choose the headset you want to use from the Bluetooth status menu, then choose Connect. The headset is automatically used as the sound output device for your computer. If the Bluetooth status menu isn't visible, choose Apple menu &gt; System Preferences, click Bluetooth, and select ""Show Bluetooth in menu bar."" I am not a Mac expert, so maybe someone else out here has better information for Sriratana."
do they work with the lg g2?,they work with anything that has bluetooth.
Is there separate volume control for incoming (like music) and outgoing (so others can hear me better)?,"I don't believe so, the volume controls are only for (incoming) speaker volume."
does it work in Libya?,yes
does this phone work in Ecuador..??,yes any GSM network google your carrier to check if they use GSM network if they do then it works
Does this phone have wifi?,Yes
"Good evening friends, I am from Venezuela and I would like to know if this phone is unlocked to any carrier?",works on any GSM network just ask your carrier or google it most carriers use GSM network except verizon and sprint
how much is de internal memory 4 gb 8 gb?,This phone is 4 gb of the internal memory.
will this phone work with tracfone?,yes tracfone uses GSM networks only all u have to do is google to see if your cell carrier uses gsm network most do except verizon thanks
will this phone work with verizon,"No it won't. Verizon won't activate it because it's not a Verizon brand phone. I bought this and it's still in the box because they wouldn't do it. AT&T however will send you a sim card for it, with your same number, and get much better phone service and customer service. It's worth it to switch!"
is this phone unlock,Yes it is
Does it have a flap to keep the phone intact when it's open? I bought one for my 4S and it kept falling out when the case was opened.,yes
will this fit an i phone5 c?,No I phone will fall out to easy don't buy it
Does this case allow the magnetic closure to turn the phone on and off?,"No, not at all. Also, another negative id if you fold the cover all the way back when talking on the phone one if the microphones is blocked and you voice is muffled and hard to understand. I stopped using the case."
Is the magnetic flap actually on the left side as shown in the picture? I ordered the brown case but the flap was on the right side.,The one I received has the flap on the left. I hope this helps.
Can it also fit a iphone 4s,No. It's for the iPhone 5/5s. Its described in the description.
can i use this for i i phone 4,I don't think so
Does this case interfere with the camera flash on the 5S? Some leave a halo effect on the pictures when the flash goes off.,I did not seem to have any issues with the camera or other functions. My only issue was the sound quality. For some reason it interfered with talking.

Does the clip swivel?,Yes. It swivels.
"Hello! Read complaint about phone ""slipping"" &amp; falling. Is the ""rubberized texture"" good enough to prevent slipping from lap, table, night stand, etc","Yes, it is. You won't be disappointed.

It doesn't appear to be able to slide out the top. there seems to be a ridge on both the bottom and top. how does it slide out?,That photo is a little deceptive there is no ridge on top just a slight lip across the top back of the case. It slips in and out real easy but have never had it fall out on me.

Can you tell me if there is a clear plastic cover for the inside screen and buttons or does this cover just surround then internal LCD screen? thanks,There is a clear plastic cover for the buttons but not the screen.
What is this case made out of? Does it seem as sturdy as the leather ones?,"If not leather, it's very leather-like. It gives the phone a good grip and feels nice (soft). It went on easily and also has a clear screen and keypad protector built in. I bought this several months ago for my (truck driver) husband. I just asked him how it's holding up. He replied, ""Great!"""

Will this case work well for the LG Revere 3?,I have it on my Revere 2 and it fits nicely...not sure how the Evere 2 compares to a 3

My wife (to whom i installed it too) had to change batteries as it was ""blown"" / melted I personally don't recommend this product as I have no use for ""a quick fix"" I would much rather something that lasts without risking messing up my battery. The decision is yours =) Hope it helps ! Happy Shopping."
"What ""size"" would I pick for an S4 that I plan on using with an otterbox defender on and a TYLT Vu Wireless Charger ?",I didn't even notice the size thing on the page when I ordered. I simply ordered a receiver for my wife's phone. She has an Otterbox Defender case on her phone as well. Looking at the other items listed under size I'm not even sure why they're there.

Does this phone work with the prepaid AT&amp;T or Verizon plans?,"This phone worked with AT&T, it support GSM and 3G SIM card, Thanks!"
I want to use this with Consumer Cellular which requires a GSM phone will this work?,Yes if you have a Sim card. Once you put your Sim card in phone it works.
I would like to know if the phone works with straight talk plan? Do it work with 3G network because most phone from china don't work with 3G but im cu,This phone works with 3G I currently use Simple Mobile as a carrier and it works fine
will it work in the philippines?,"yes, for worldwide use!"
Can the phone be in standby mode to interact with the TecTile? Some are saying the phone has to be completely on and passcode entered.,the phone may not be in standby mode. It must be fully on.
Can the phone constantly touch the tile or will it keep trying to active. I want one on my car dock to launch a drive mode app.,"Depends on the app that you're using to launch the response to the NFC tag. I use ""Trigger"" app and you can set the interval you'd like to prevent ""double-activations"""
How many bytes does each tag hold?,1KB. NFC Interactor says only 884 bytes are writable.
Has anyone tried these on the new Galaxy Note 4?,I have not but I have the note 3 and they should work just as well if not better.
Will these work with the Galaxy S5? Thanks in advance!,"Assumig your phone has NFC, check to see if your phone can download the Samsung app to program them. I use an app called trigger which works just the same. If you can download it, you can program it. Trigger is also a really nice free app to get into some more automation. Look up tasker which gives you full access to the abilities of your phone"
Is it possible to program these so that an alarm on the phone (Note 4) is triggered if they go out of range?,No. You have to pass the phone over the tile to activate it. It works through nfc
Has anyone found a way to turn on/off gps? I am using a GS4 and have tried several apps.,"I use an app called tasker with my nfc. tasker is an automation tool and can do all kinds of cool things. if my nfc writer can't perform some action, I'll turn to tasker and define a set of steps I want done. some nfc writers allow you to call a tasker set of instructions. So, even though the nfc writer might not do the job, because tasker can be called from nfc we can add functionality. good luck!"
"My Note 3 tells me ""This tag is not supported"". Did I get sent the wrong product?","Although, I'm not a expert on the subject, my research keeps coming up with compatible with the mini note 3. My question is what's the mini(neo) and is there a non-mini. Do you have access to any non-tectile nfc tags, maybe a friends. you could see if you can read other types of nfc tags to confirm that it's the tectile and not something else that's causing the problem. If it's saying ""This tag is not supported"" then we can deduce that the nfc antenna picked up something. Also, check for any software updates for your phone before testing further. Good Luck!"
"Perhaps I missed this bit of info, but are these rewriteable? Thanks in advance for any responses.","yes they are rewritable until you permanently write them. there are options to write onto tags and permanently write onto tags. however, i have never wrote permanently (just in case)"
do they work with iphone 6?,"No, these tags are Samsung specific. Most tags are only compatible with Android devices as Apple has not completely come on board with the NFC reader and writer required for tags."
Will I need to buy a cord to charge this device? Would I need a double ended usb cord to charge? Thank you!,No you won't have to buy a chord. It comes with a USB cable so it can plug into a computer or you could use an iPhone outlet plug on the USB end to charge it right from a wall outlet.
Will it work on the iphone 5C?,Hi Donna Thanks for inquiry. Yes this will work on iPhone 5C
how long will it hold its charge?,I have had mine a month and only charged it once.
"Since this covers the bottom, can you still hear music or a phone call?","Yes, you can hear everything. No problems."
is there an adapter that will fit the cord so it will work on a phone with Otterbox cover?,"No, I have to take my case off to use this device. It's a pain but totally worth it!"
Why isn't there information letting you know that this product will not fit the iphone 5/5s if there is a case on the phone?,If you can plug your charger cord you should be able to plug in this device.
How long it takes to chrage it,Maybe 20-30 minutes to completely charge an dead phone
"I have an otterbox case on my phone, can I use it even if I have the case on?",No. The phonesuit doesnt fit well on the phone with any case really. This is the one disadvantage. I have a very thin case on my phone and I still have to remove it to connect the phonesuit.
Does this charge an ipad mini?,Yes it will work on the mini
"Hi, is the XT or the regular?","I'm not sure what XT is. The battery is 3"" x 1 1/2"" To use you must remove the case on your phone for the battery to snap in tight"
"Is this product only a charger or, can you use it immediately with the iPhone 5 if the internal battery goes dead?",Can use it immediately
"Since this covers the bottom, can you still hear music or a phone call?",Speaker volume would be reduced by about 30% when plugged on...based on unscientific ear test. This item is recommended for its extreme usability. Hope this helps.
Any reason this would not work with new 6 plus?,its working on my iphone 6 so theirs no reason not to work on the 6 plus
"Looks like this is not ""Apple Certified."" Does it work with iOS7 (on the iphone 5 and 5S)?","It works great with iphone5, i dont own 5s can't tell about that, it's great product"
Does it work with smaller otter case,"Barbara, I'm not sure what the measurements are for the small otter case. I have a Vera Bradley snap-on case for my iPhone 5, and the PhoneSuit charger is a perfect fit. I would email or call the PhoneSuit people to find out about the fit. I absolutely love my PhoneSuit charger, so if it fits, I would recommend it."
Can I charge my OEM battery in the charger?,Yup. Mines t mobile gs4 tho but that shouldnt matter if you have a one from a different carrier. Also it charges pretty slow by itself with the 2 AC prongs. About 4hrs full charge since it has a 0.6amp charge rate. 1amp if you got a male to male usb cord which this package doesn't include one but either way dont expect it to charge as fast as using a micro usb cord.
is it compatable with verizon models,"Yes, Mine is a Verizon model. I don't think there is a difference in the models in as such the battery is concerned."
"What does ""not NFC"" mean...","NFC is used for things like using your phone as a credit card at the grocery store. Its essentially a data transfer system, sort of like bluetooth or wifi, its just another one of those. If you get a battery that is non NFC then you can still use wifi and bluetooth, just not NFC, if you don't know what it is then Id bet you don't use it, I never use it, so these batteries are perfect for me."
"it says ""not for Galaxy S4 Active"" why? and do you sell one that is for the active?","Not the poster, but either the Active uses something with NFC or a completely different battery"
"How long do the batteries stay charged after taking off the charger (standby time, not usage)?","Hi John, the longest I've had mine off the charger before putting it in my phone was a little less than 24 hours. It had 100% charge. I'm a heavy phone user and that is probably the longest my charged batteries will go before using them."
does it work for the s4 from at&amp;t sgh-i337,"Yes, that is the phone I have"
"Can I leave the battery in my phone and just charge it that way, or do I have to take it out of the phone and use the charger that comes with the battery?","The charger comes w/ a usb port, so you can charge your phone and the extra battery at the same time"
Why does my Anker charger's LED light always turn blue once plugged in (with and without a battery) and only sometimes charges batteries?,The blue light indicates that there is power to the charger. If the light does not turn purple(pink) then the battery is not charging. It is easy to get the alignment off when putting the batter in and then the batter wont charge.
Will it work for i9502? It's the dual SIM version. The OEM battery that mine came with has 4 contact pins.,While I don't know the answer for sure. I can tell you it is the same as my S4 oem battery and also has 4 contact pins.
I just picked this up. Is the charger supposed to emit a high pitched whine while its plugged in and charging?,It's not suppose to. I checked and rechecked mine before answering your question. You shouls get in touch with Anker's support. They usually give a reply within 24hours.
"Can it charge itself in sun and also charge the attached devices (assuming there is some charge left) at the same time, without requiring any switch?","It can, I fully charged an iPhone 4S three times while on a hiking trip in the Adirondacks NY. Make sure it's fully charged before you leave and let the solar power maintain the internal battery between charges. As I read before I bought this item it would take a few days to fully charge via solar only."
How long does it take for the solar to charge the internal batteries from empty to full?,"You can calculate it based on the specs. For the 7200mAh, the max input is 180mA for solar; therefore, 7200 divided by 180 = 40 hours of peak solar charging. Max input for plugin is 1000mA, so that equals 7.2 hours of plugin. For the 10,000mAh, the solar input is 200mA = 50 hours of peak solar charging & plugin input of 1500mA equals 6.7 hours plugin. If lighting is not at full light, solar could take even longer time."
Does it come with a plug to charge it electrically. International compatibility?,It uses a standard micro USB plug that you can use with your own charger.
Will it charge a kindle fire/,Definitely
How do I replace the Apple adapter it does not work..,Any USB to Apple (30 pin or lightning) cable will work. I really don't use the enclosed cable because it's too short for my own uses.
Can you use a usb hub to charge more than one device?,"I already tried using my ""AmazonBasics USB 2.0 4-Port Ultra Mini Hub"" and doesn't work."
does it come with the cord needed to charge the device with electricity instead of sunlight?,"It come with a usb to a mini usb cord. If you have a standard mini usb phone charger that will work, otherwise it does not come with additional cords."
What is the operating temperature range?,"Honestly I am not sure, I leave it out in 100 degree heat for a good amount of time. One charge usually charges my iPhone completely!! Sorry if I didn't answer your question..."
"I have an adroid phone, I see an adaptor to fit it, but what cable am I supposed to use? there isn't a cable in the box","I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 2. My Poweradd came with a short coiled cable, about four inches long, and four adapters, none of which, fit my phone. I just use the regular charging cable that came with the phone, and plug it into the USB port on the Poweradd itself. If the coiled cable is missing and you need it, You'll have to go back to the seller."
"can you just plug in a USB to lighting adapter that you get with your phone (iPhone 5), or do you have to use the adapters it comes with?","Yes, you can plug anything up to this battery pack. As long as it has a full size usb, your good to go."
"Can it charge itself in sun and also charge the attached devices (assuming there is some charge left) at the same time, without requiring any switch?","It can, I fully charged an iPhone 4S three times while on a hiking trip in the Adirondacks NY.

Do I HAVE to buy one of these covers in order for wireless charger to work with my S4?,The phone does not have wireless charging. It needs the antenna and chip built into the accessory cover.
Does NFC work through this cover?,"Yes. The cover did not limit any of the other functionality of my S4. Only draw back is it charges slower than the power cord, but I found that is the issue with all wireless charging...just isn't quite as fast."
Will this work with a QI wireless charging pad?,"It worked with the Qi I have in the car, but does not seem to work with the Energizer brand home unit that I purchased for my S3."
"When charging, whats the max amps output? Qi receiver cards provide their max output, but I don't see it here.",Mine says 600mA but it send to charge faster than that. I've had mine for probably a year with no problems.
does this work on duracell powermat used for wireless charging.,"It should, I have just some generic pad. Basically if it is Qi it will work"
Does thi case come in black?,Yes it also comes in black. You can find it at http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00D4L6IZS
Does this make the phone too bulky for cases (otterbox) to easily fit?,I had to take the foam piece inside the Otterbox off to make it work
"Why does this cover have 4 electrical contacts, but other add-on Qi receivers have only 2 electrical contacts?",I don't know the reason why but I can tell you with the S4 that there are 4 contacts on the phone that match up with the case. It has been working great since I bought it. Sorry for not having more info.
"I'm sure it's only millimeters at best. What about the OtterBox Commuter Series Case, or the Defender Case? Any issues here? I love the concept.","If you're asking whether or not the phone will fit in the OtterBox cases with this back cover on, then no, it will not. This back cover will cause the phone not to fit into OtterBox cases, although I did read about one person how modded his OtterBox case to make it fit. You're best bet is to install a qi wireless receiver (in lieu of a new back cover) and use the original back cover so it'll fit in OtterBox cases. I purchased this one on Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F6OTZV0/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1, and it worked with my OtterBox Defender case via the original back cover. If you do it this way, make sure you get a qi charger that can reach the receiver through the thick case as well. I use this one: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F6SPYJS/ref=oh_details_o01_s01_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1, and it works fine. Hope this helps..."
I am concerned that the Otterbox case will no longer fit with the new cover. Are there some recommended cases for this cover?,"The Otterbox Defender will fit; you just need to remove the foam insert inside the hard shell. It will be a tight fit, but it WILL fit."
Does the S4 Case Wireless Charging Battery Cover work with Jeeps Qi Charging Pad?,"Yes, it also works with the Qi charger from Dodge and Toyota"
This original Samsung product? Korean production?,Yes
Does this cover work with the Duracell&reg; PowerMat?,Yes
does this work with Ballistic protective covers installed over this back cover,NO
What is the max charging current with this adapter?,With a 10 watt wall port my phone charges just as fast as it would normally at 5 watts. Keep in mind though that the connection is more reliable than a micro usb (i.e. you don't have to worry about breaking the connector every time your phone gets knocked off the night stand like you do with a standard cable) so it ends up charging faster than most cables. (at least in my experience)
will this fit the s4 active?,fits is my samsung s4. I dont know about the active part. If That is different model or what
Is there a compatible samsung case for this cover? My regular samsung case will not work with this case properly.,I have used Spigen Neo Hybrid and Diztronic for the Galaxy S4

how do i listen to music on it?,"Its a bluetooth device..so to be able to listen to it u have a phone or iPod or any device that have Bluetooth....let's say you do have a device and having trouble connecting ..go to your phone or device that u want to hear music from and go to your settings ..in the settings should be a tab saying Bluetooth press it and on the top of the screen should say ""discover"" press that and it will go on ""discovery mode""..

I wonder if it works with the ps3 system?,I dont now
Has anyone used these for jogging purposes? Do they stay on? Are they comfortable? Sweat resistant?,Awsome great dang a beat headphone love it
"Is this stereo? Does anyone know if it works with binaural tones? Can anyone compare this to the older Sony BT101, which is discontinued?",All I can say is that they are stereo and a great price.
sound quality,Good sound quality the only negative is the top arch over the head has begun to get hairline cracks. I've had it for a few months now and they seem to work pretty good. For the price even if I get six months it's worth it also good sound cancellation when using heavy equipment

My problem is with the i-Blason HD Matte Bubble Free Screen Protector for the reason I mentioned in the review. I did also purchase the i-Blason Samsung Galaxy S4 Active Prime Series Dual Layer Holster Case and it fits my S4 active very well and I am happy with that.

My phone just arrived...stupid question. How do you remove the rear cover?,There is a tiny slit on the top that you just pry open. No high tec opening. Just pull from that slit and the back will come off. I use my fingernail to get in it. Hope this helps
"How does the SIM service switching work? When you dial a number, does it ask you to choose a carrier?

My current one is too fat and has to be taken off for them to connect properly.,That's a good question because I've had that with other cases too. Not this one.

I really think this is a terrific case.

Should I get the smooth black or Satin Silver? Which one is easier tO SCRATCH?,I have silver and my wife has black. My silver case shows scratches easier than her black case. Not as easy to see on the black one.
Is the camera cutout on the back large enough to accommodate the iPhone 5s's two LED flashes?,just got it....absolutely big enough :)
"Ive read that headphones don't fit through the case, is this still true or has this been fixed? Is there a different style you have that allows this?","Thank you for your question. All of our cases are designed to be compatible with the earphones with the standard male 3.5mm output such as Apple EarPods, Samsung stock earphones, beats by Dr Dre, Skull Candy, etc. However, the compatibility will also depend on how thick the mold or shielding of the output is. If the shielding of the earphone is thicker than the standard size, it may hinder the earphone from working perfectly with the case."
What are the actual dimensions of this case: W x L x H? Thanks,W=6.45cm L=13cm H=1.12cm W=2.53in L=5.11in H=0.44in
head phone,Headphone jack is on the bottom and yes there is an opening on the case for it.
charging port,The regular charger fits without having to remove the case. My headphone jack also fits well. The only thing I've had a problem with is with my sounddock and the 30pin to lightning adapter. The adapter will not fit with case on. I just use the Bluetooth function vs taking the case off and on.
"Does this case have a rubberized grip, or is it slick and slippery?",The black areas are like a hardened rubber/plastic. It is not as grippy as rubber but definitely not slippery.
Has anybody dropped their phone yet?,"I have, from about 3 feet onto travertine. Made a dull noise and landed face down... Not a scratch!"
"There is 3 size options. 1) 5, 2) 5s 3) onesize? What is the onesize? Will it fit the 5s and come in slate color? Pros/Cons?",I just got the 5s size. Don't know what is onesize? Pros: great protection all around. Easy on and off. Cover on buttons works well. Cons: no screen protection. Some headphone jacks don't fit around the hole but not a big deal.
"Does this case have a front cover? Also, since the 5s has finger print capability will this cover allow for that?","Nope, no front cover."
Does anybody know if this is compatible with the iPhone 5c?,"No it will only work w/ the older ""5"" or the ""5s"". 5c is too big for the case."
Is the white hard piece a shiny plastic or matte finish?,"It's not plastic, I think it's metal"
Does the case interfere with the camera and flash at all?,"No, the case does not interfere with camera operation. I have taken 150 of so shots without issue. The case is top quality with a high level of precision detail. As good looking as the phone itself. Nicest case, of this type, I have owned."
Does case have way to attach to belt?,Unfortunately it does not have belt clip
So this is the complete case correct? And can I switch to white top to a different color?,"It's the complete case. The white part is removable, but it only comes with one color, not sure if you can buy replacements or not. Doesnt come with a screen protector"
will i have a problem keeping the white part clean. Because I hate when something i am carry around gets dirty.,I also got some screen protectors so the white face of my phone is protected. The back of my phone is staying pretty clean except around the Apple logo.
Does it easily slide in and out of tight jeans pockets?,"Yes, case is very slim and ridges on case shouldn't be an issue."
Does it protect the screen when dropping the phone?,The case has a beveled edge around the screen that does aid in protecting the screen against drops. In my opinion the screen could still crack if it hit flush on a hard surface but that is true with any case save for an otterbox or lifeproof style case. For the price this case provides the best protection.
Is this case slippery or does it have a good grip to prevent drops?,"I'd put it somewhere in the middle. It is not ""sticky"" like silicone and it's not as slippery as glossy plastic. It is textured plastic, so it feels like it's in the middle somewhere. For me, it's the sweet spot - easy enough to slip into a pocket and not so slippy that I drop it."
drop phone,"I have dropped the phone several times and my phone was protected, no scratches at all. I have the case for 3 monthes and after dropping it several times, it still looks great!"
the cut out for the apple logo on the back. is it protected?,"No, if the protector was not on your phone you could stick your finger through it. Same applies to the speaker and power openings."
Will this solar charger work with my Sony Handycam DCR-SX85 and is this all I need? Thank you,"No, even when the solar charger is fully charged at 100% it can only power up my S4 phone to 70%. Good use for cell phone but not anything else."
Has anybody figured out a good way to attach this to a backpack or bike bag?,"I gave the solar charger as a gift, so I can't answer that. My brother loves it though. He is not a backpacker or a biker however."
Wll it charge mobile while solar charging its own battery?,"That's a good question. I THINK it works by either charging the connected device from its battery, or by charging the battery. There's an on/off switch that powers the USB connection. So that's a way to differentiate this from a true solar charger. With this you can charge and store, with a solar charger you have to leave the device connected to the solar charger and in the sun to charge. I could be wrong about that. I may ahve to test that the next sunny day."
Will this case work with Verizon version of the Nokia 928?,"You will need to place your order for your particular phone, as it will be a different case."
"The clip on mine broke after one week, small u-shaped metal tab popped out now it won't close. Is it fixable?","I fixed mine after it came out of the socket, but once it broke again I just threw it away. You can get one cheap enough to not worry about it."
does this case fit the lumia 928 snug? and how durable is it? does it slip out of hand easily?,"Its nice. Fits well, protects it. I don't use the belt clip piece because that feels bulky, but otherwise, id rate this over any other kind of case I've used on other devices. Doesn't slip off easily. Push the corners in when you've got the plastic on to make it look cleaner"
does this case fit the lumia 928 snug? and how durable is it? does it slip out of hand easily?,Very snug.Very durable! I drop my phone often great protection. Will not slip out accidentally u have to work to get out of holster. I keep mine in my pocket now.
does it have a built in sceen protector,No it does not
The phone in the image for the Nokia 928 doesn't look like the 928 I have. WIll this case fit the latest model Nokia 928?,"Yes, I have a Nokia 928 and it fits perfectly."
It will not fit in the case at all...what should I do?,"Rebecca...first place the soft rubber skin on the phone by snapping two opposite corners over the corners of the phone, then stretch the other two corners over the phone one at a time. Adjust the cover for a good consistent fit. Then snap the hard plastic back over the back of the soft rubber skin, you will need to press the middle of each side from behind until the edges snap in. As before, once it is on you can adjust to have all of the features aligned between the two parts of the cover. Also important - when you place the phone into the holster the face of the phone should be pointing inward toward the holster. You can do it!"
does it have a special volume for hard to hear seniors,"It does have extra loud volume, how ever it is hard to find, and realy hard to use. You would be better off witb a diffrent phone."
why does the phone just turn off on it's own i purchased this phone for my dad and it keeps turning off on it's own,It is so long since we had this phone -- briefly! -- that I can no longer answer specific questions about it. But I can say for certain that it was trash.
Can you text with this phone?,Yes you can text with this phone.
can you use on at&amp;t?,Well im using it outside of united states con movistar!!
camera specs,Camera sucks and is way to hard to use.
does it come with a wall charger,"Yes, it came with a a foreign wall charger (2 round posts) with a U.S. travel adapter/wall charger, which fit into it, to accommodate U.S. electrical sockets. So, if you wanted to travel abroad with the phone you would need to get a travel adapter for the country you were traveling in, if it required something other than these two capabilities."
What are the phone's dimensions?,Main product dimensions: 125x57x16mm (L x W x D) Main product weight: 97g Thank You
What brand is the phone?,Unfortunately the only information I have on the phone is the information in the listing. The only reason we are listing it without knowing the exact brand is due to the fact that we know for a fact that it is by far the best senior phone out on the market today. It has been selling like crazy. I'm sorry I couldn't help with that answer any more than that. Rob

I've used SIM just in Romania and Australia. Also the package which I received was with an european plug for charging and it had an adaptor for USA. I hope this will help you!"

Does this phone have a front and back camera,Yes it does.
Is this the Original or the Clone a.k.a fake one?,Original
Can this work for 4G AT&amp;T?,"If the phone is unlocked any carrier should be able to host it. (this is my understanding anyway) If at&t has 4G LTE service in your area then this phone is compatible, it just may need to be turned on. Once you have a carrier you can just Google ""turn on 4g Samsung Galaxy S4"", there are many sites that will walk you through. Super easy though. Hope this helps"
"Hi, does this phone come with a verizon logo or any other company logo? - (I'm trying to make sure I got the correct one delivered)","No, it doesn't come with any logo. It is a Unlooked phone, therefore, you just hacve to put your sind card and thats it."

My phone case cracked. can i get the replacement since there is lifetime luvvitt&reg; warranty in this product?,Definitely!Please contact our support team.
"Anyone know how to utilize the lifetime warranty? After two weeks, there is a scratch on the case. It is suppose to be anti-scratch.","Honestly, I've had this case for a few months now, and it is fairly scratched up on the back. The only way it gets scratched is when I set it down on the desk, because it travels solo in my pockets. I do not know how to take advantage of the warranty, however, if several cases are getting scratched (yours, mine, cases from other reviewers), I don't think that the case is really anti-scratch. I accept it for what it is, which is a cheap case that does a decent job of protecting the phone. Sorry that this doesn't really answer your question though."
Does it cover the top and the bottom of the phone?,No
Do I still need a screen protector and does case help prevent damage to dropped phones?,It does not have a screen. I dropped my phone twice and both times the phone popped out. I was lucky it didn't break. I plan on replacing the case.
How many pieces is this case? is it similar to the Otterbox Defender?,"Kevin, the case is two pieces. There is a black silicon inner layer and a hard blue plastic-y outer layer. I've never used an Otterbox Defender case though so I can't comment on that aspect. Hope this helps!"
is there something over the screen? Or just hard case around the phone?,It's a silicone case that you slip into a hard shell for double protection. There is nothing covering the screen. You'll want to get those plastic/film screen protectors. For your screen.
will this case fit samsung galaxy 4s mini ?,"It is a nice case, but, no, the one I bought won't fit the Galaxy 4s Mini. I can't say if that page now offers choices, though."

Hello i am looking for replacement Back camera glass lens circle for Samsung Galaxy S4 i545,This would be the replacement to get. I was a bit nervous about doing this myself but for the inexpensive price it was worth a shot. All the tool came in and I don't think I even used them. The broken lens popped out and I had no problem replacing it with the new one. My phone is as good as new!
Does this actually include the glass part of the lens?,"Yes it does, my glass piece fell off however because the adhesive it came with was not very strong. If you do order this I would suggest an alternative adhesive, maybe super glue."

Can I use this portable charger in country using 240V? thanks,Yes.
Can I charge the external battery from the outlet at the same time I have a device being charged plugged into the battery?,"No, this one doesn't support that."
"What is the better buy? The 2nd gen 9000 or the 3E, outside of the fact you get an extra 1000mAh?","I'd go for this one over the 3E. The 3E is good, but it's a lot older. No shake to wake, charge ports top out at 2 A (this one is 2.4 max) so it's slower for devices that can take higher current. The charge display is also 4 LEDs, not 10 like this one. I had some 4 LED display batteries and I can tell you that those extra LEDs really help- they give you a much clearer idea of how much power is left (especially if it's one of the higher capacity packs, like the Astro E5). With the old 4 light display, when it gets to 25% you see one light lit... same as when it's at 1%. 25% is quite a bit of juice on something like the E5 (15,000 mAh) but 1% isn't on anything, and the thing is you can't tell which it is. The 2nd gen Astros can show you all the way down to 10% granularity which is a whole lot better."
Does this work for Kindle readers?,Yes. It will charge a wide variety of devices. We have two different Kindle readers. It does well with both. A great value.
How is the unit charged? Does it have lithiun-ion battery that is rehargeable by electricity?,I don't know what kind of battery it has but it's a good one. You charge it with a cable with a typical micro USB end. The kind that charges most android phones and tablets. Plug it into a wall outlet or a USB port on a computer. Takes several hours to fully charge but it lasts.
Will it affect my iPhone 5's battery life if I use it more often?,it does not. but I would recommend just until your phone battery life is about 30-45 % before charging it up and stuff. other than that its a great device.
Can I charge my iPad air using the Smart usb at the same time as charging an iPhone 5 using the Universal Usb?,"Hi, Yes it does charge my iPad Air and iPhone 5 together, but it charges slow. Let me know if you need more info."

Does it work with Nexus 4 ?,Yes it does! I have a nexus 4 and it charges just fine.
what cases work with wireless charger?,"The transceiver works with virtually any case. When installed correctly, the back deflects or bulges only minutely, if at all - fare less than a millimeter. It did not interfere with my 2 part rigid carbon fiber case, 2 part Case Logic case nor an Otterbox Defender. The same is true of the charger itself; none of the cases interfered with charging."
"Is there any way to turn the beeping off? I'd like to have this next to my bed, but I certainly don't want the beeping to be an annoyance. thx","you can easily crack it open and cut the wires going to the clearly visible pc speaker, then just pop it back together. did it on mine..i was afraid of it not fitting back together, but they're nice tabs that are meant to be opened up and put back."
Does it work well with the Note3?,"Yes, it works perfectly. I bought the OEM Samsung charging cover for the phone because I wasn't sure on the quality of the after-market covers. But the RAVPower charger has performed flawlessly with the OEM cover."
"I have installed a insten receiver on my Note4. when it is green, it discharges. Any ideas?","Hi, When the light is green its not charging any more, Battery is at 100%. its supposed to start discharging."
"I have a HTC One X (US AT&amp;T version) and was wondering if i works with this type of device also, or would a reciever be needed?","That phones battery is hidden if i remember correctly so i would assume you would need a cover but yes you need a receiver on any device for it to work but with a closed battery you would need to visit htc website or email ravpower support cause there very prompt on answering questions, great product also and hope it works for you."
samsung galaxy note 3 do i need a reciever or nay other equiptment?,Yes. The Note 3 will need a receiver. There are qi back door covers or receiver cards that fit with your own cover/case.
nexus 7,"Yes, I have the Nexus 7 2nd Gen, and it charges it."
My unit seems to have intermittent difficulty waking up from idle mode. I need to unplug/plug the unit for it to wake up. Is this behavior normal ?,"Dear SRB, Thanks for your inquiry.

I just purchased one and havent even used it yet do my droid 4 need a special back,It needs a special adapter for the battery itself and your all set.
ill this work with the Verizon Motorola Droid Maxx and if so will it charge direct or is there cover needed?,"I assume it will work fine with Droid Maxx. It works great with Droid Mini with no additional receivers or covers required. Look in your manual. If the phone is Qi ready, it will work."

"Does this trickle charge once your phone's battery is full, or continue charging at full speed the entire time?",Trickle charge at least for Google Nexus phones
"How do I turn off the Rav? Also, if it decides to not trickle my Moto X, do I need to remember to turn on the rav? Just how smart are these qi things in current management?","If the Rav is plugged into a power supply it is ""on"", and will charge a device with the appropriate receiver. When the device is charged, the Rav will still be on, but will cease charging the device. When the Rav is unplugged, drawing from its internal battery to charge your device, you need to turn it ""on"". Once on, it will remain on until your device is charged, it will turn off when your device is fully charged. It will also turn off after some set duration (I believe about 2 min) when there is no ""draw"" on the battery, so you can't waste its battery accidentally. I've been very happy with mine."
will it charge a verizon LG G3,The lg g3 does not have wireless charging capabilities as it stands. However they do sell cases for it to. that's what I did. But as long as you have a cover that does it will just fine. It's really worth it. My only problem right now is that the charger port for it fell out so I have to fix it. But its great and charges 2 phones at once as long as yours is charging first :)
does it charge the nexus 5?,"Yes, wirelessly and through the usb"
I have a Note 3 with original battery and genuine Samsung leather cover. Do I need to get anything else to use this?,It looks like the Note 3 doesn't support Qi charging out of the box. You need a new Qi-enabled backplate or case. Then you would be able to use this charger.
"fully charged, how many charges will the battery pack provide? or better yet if my phone is at 1% will the battery pack charge it back to 100%?",It depends on the phone you have. In my case I only can charge once in my galaxy note 3 and once in my lg g r smart watch both in one charge of the battery
I have had mixed results charging the phone with the case on. Does this device have a stronger/weaker signal relative to other Qi chargers?,"It works through the case on my Nokia Icon (fairly thick case) and it works through the case on my fiance's HTC 8X. The other QI chargers I use also work through the cases: Nokia's flat charger, car charger, speaker charger, and the TYLT."
Just want to make a few things more clear before I go ahead and buy this. Will the wireless charging on this work with a Samsung Galaxy S6?,Yes it will because the SG S6 supports qi wireless charging.
I would like to knows if it works for iphone 6 plus,"Sure. It's just a battery pack. But you need to use the lightening cable. If you are asking whether you can use the function of wireless charging, the answer is NO because the iPhone 6 doesn't support wireless charging."
Can this unit be charged at the same time as it's being used to power equipment?,Yes it can and it actually charges pretty fast :)
will this work with the MS Surface 3 Pro?,Yes it will but it only comes with a few connection tips it may not come with the one that fits in the Pro that's the only issue but you can purchase extra tips on Amazon around 20 or less
Is there a USB output of 20 volts for this? It seems the Yoga 3 pro charges via usb and is at 20 volts.,The max output for the USB ports is 5 volts. But there is an adapter allowing you to plug the main 20 volt output into a usb outlet.
"will it work with lenono yoga pro 3 which has different plug than the lenono yoga pro 2, more usb looking but not exactly usb",No
I left the Dell tip (second to the largest plug) and the cable that connects it to the battery in a rental car. How can I purchase replacements?,When I needed one I found a replacement at Frys.
Will this work for a 19.5V Dell Vostro?,Great
Can this be taken on an Airplane,"There are many new IATA rules regarding the transportation of large lithium ion/polymer battery packs, and they may also vary between countries (USA versus other countries and different airlines (see web sites below). Your PowerAdd battery back is rated at 32000 mAh which is therefore 32 x 3.7 = 118.4 Wh which is above the 100 Wh limit. For larger (&gt; 100 to &lt; 160 Wh) battery packs you MAY have to obtain permission from the airline to take up to 2 of them as spares on-board (ONLY permitted as carry-on, not checked-in), you should also package them according to the IATA guidelines (in their original box with electrical tape-sealed input/output ports to prevent a short circuit), and MAY also request you to present a safety sheet for the UN standards (see web pages below). I don't know whether or not this company (PowerAdd) has performed these tests and will supply you with the safety test sheet (see below where I have found few companies I contacted would provide me with this safety sheet for their lithium ion/polymer batteries. Lithium Ion/Polymer Batteries allowed on Airlines, packaging and taping the inputs/outputs, AND VERY IMPORTANTLY THE NEW REGULATIONS FOR THE UN MANUAL OF TEST CRITERIA PART III SUBSECTION 38.3 AND DROP TEST IATA DGR 49: UPDATE: HERE IS THE IATA 2015 GUIDANCE DOCUMENT: SEE SECTION 2.3.4.7 FOR THE TRANSPORTATION OF LARGE (&gt; 100 WH AND &lt; 160 WH) LITHIUM ION/POLYMER BATTERIES: http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/cargo/dgr/Documents/lithium-battery-guidance-document-2015-en.pdf Flights in the USA http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ash/ash_programs/hazmat/passenger_info/media/faa_airline_passengers_and_batteries.pdf British Airlines: http://www.britishairways.com/cms/global/pdfs/lithium_battery.pdf Cathay Pacific: http://www.cathaypacific.com/cx/en_HK/travel-information/baggage/restricted-items/batteries.html Spare Lithium Battery Protection: http://safetravel.dot.gov/tips.html IATA Updated Lithium Ion Passenger Sheet: http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/cargo/dgr/Documents/passenger-lithium-battery.pdf IATA Fuller Sheet on Lithium Ion/Polymer Batteries: http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/cargo/dgr/Documents/Lithium-Battery-Guidance-2014.pdf UN Manual of Test and Criteria Part III Subsection 38.3: http://www.kta-ev.com/v/vspfiles/assets/images/intertek-un-lithium-ion-batteries-transportation.pdf VERY IMPORTANTLY, the airline MAY require the passenger to obtain permission before taking on-board a lithium ion battery of &gt; 100 Wh and &lt; 160 Wh capacities (only allowed as carry on except for some medical devices), with protection from damage (in original packaging with the input and output plugs taped, and with a copy of the UN Manual of Test and Criteria Part III Subsection 38.3 (Test T1 to T8) and Drop Test IATA DGR 49 sheet showing that the battery passed all of those tests. I have found that lithium ion/polymer battery suppliers are reluctant to provide you with this sheet or have not tested their batteries to this standard. Anker told me they could not give me this test sheet for their 20000 mAh (74 Wh) Astro Pro 2 Gen 1 battery, Goal Zero were testing their 100 Wh Sherpa 100 battery pack but a company correspondent told me that they would not provide me with the test sheet, while BIxPower immediately provided me with their fully detailed and successful UN Manual of Test and Criteria Part III Subsection 38.3 and Drop Test IATA DGR 49 sheet for their BixPower BP 160 (153 Wh) lithium ion battery pack, and which was signed by the Engineering Manager! This company (BixPower) was the only one I found at that time who was prepared to comply with the IATA and provide such a safety sheet for these tests: 1) T1 Altitude 2) T2 Thermal Cycling 3) T3 Vibration 4) T4 Shock 5) T5 External Short Circuit 6) T6 Impact 7) T7 Overcharge 8) T8 Forced Discharge And B: Drop Test IATA DGR 49 I believe that the latter test sheets may be increasingly requested by airlines to prevent inexpensive, poorly manufactered, and therefore potential dangerous large lithium ion/polymer batteries being transported, and I would not wish to be denied permission to transport a lithium ion/polymer battery or, worse still, get prosecuted due to transporting a large lithium ion/polymer battery on an airline which inadvertently caught fire without also having a copy of the PASSED UN test safety sheet for that particular battery. In conclusion, I believe that it is very important for yourself and fellow passengers to strictly comply with the IATA and airline safety rules regarding these batteries and ensure that you buy safe batteries which have sucessfully passed all of the appropriate safety tests for which the UN Tests safety sheet is provided."
"I just received the unit and used it once till full discharge, it takes very long time to recharge it again, like after 48 hours of continuous charging the panel shows 22% only, any advices?",Something is defective. Likely the ac charger. Mine takes 6 hours

"I have an ASUS Gamers Republic 17"" with input of 19.5v ""Would this be able to charge this beast of a laptop? It is akin to Alienware type laptop.","It should be able to. It won't power it when it is gaming, but if you're web-browsing or just doing general productivity tasks you should be set. I have a custom build but it is based off of a Clevo W350ST, which isn't anything particularly powerful, but it has a GTX 765M. This battery runs flawlessly when it only uses the integrated graphics. Honestly, I would not expect it to run fantastic if your computer does not have graphics switching, but I would think it would have switching, as it is a very power intensive and high-end computer. The reason I would expect it not to run well with the graphics card on is that your computer could temporarily have spike processor usage that could switch off the battery. For instance, chrome and outlook are opened at the same time requiring more power, but the battery is close to its current limit already. I also have a Turcom battery, but I feel that this is the better built and functioning product for barely any difference in price. Hope this helps."
if you can listen to music with the phone,"Yes I can. Works very well. Mind you this is not a powerful unit. But, it is perfect for working out and for the car ."

i have a kuzy rubberized hard case on my mac BOOK AIR 13....WILL THIS COVER FIT MY AIR 13?,This case fits like a glove so you would have to really stretch and flex to make it fit. This leather snugg is meant to protect as well so the case may be overkill.
I've heard that magnets aren't good for computers. Has anyone had any issues with their computers from carrying them in a magnetic case?,"It depends if your device is solid state or not. If it is solid state that means there are no moving parts so the magnets wont hurt anything. If your device is not solid state then you should power it completely off every time you store your laptop and move it. And if you do this properly, the magnets shouldnt have any affect on it. Also, the magnets are very small and not really what Id consider any threat to your device."
"Would this sleeve slip into a handled laptop case? I was thinking of getting a 15"" carry case and putting this inside to protect the laptop better","Nope, it would not. And the sleeve actually sucks. I have a 13"" MacPro"
"I know it clearly says that it'll fit 13"" machine but any one had experience if they were able to fit 13.3 inch machine in this sleeve? Thanks.",No
Will it fit any non-retinal 13 inch Macbook pro? Will the magnetic closure work fine?,"Hi, Thank you for your question. This case is only designed for Non Retina versions of the laptop. Thank you The Snugg"
"Can I fit an ASUS 13.3"" Zenbook in this sleeve?","I apologize, but I do not know about any other computers and their abilities to fit it the Snugg sleeve. It works great with the 13"" MacBook Pro. Maybe you can compare the specs with your laptop."
"i have a new Lenovo Yoga 3, 14"" Dims are 13.18"" x 9.03"" x 0.72"" will this fit?",the product I purchased did not fit the laptop it was intended for.
can I fit a new dell xps 13 in this,"I've got both a MacBook Pro 13"" and a HP EliteBook 820 13"" and they both will fit. My Mac has a protective shell (top and bottom) and barely fits, but it will stretch a LITTLE. I'm not sure about Dell. When the case was new, the magnetic flap wouldn't close so I put the computer in and flipped it over, putting the weight on it to help it stretch. Now it closes just fine."
"My Macbook Pro is 13"" and is A1278 which I do not see as one of the model listed above. Will this case fit my laptop?",I am not exactly positive but the pictures on the side say which products that this should fit. A1278 is listed on there so I would assume that it fits.
Will a 2011 Macbook Pro (a bit thicker than the current models) fit in this sleeve?,Yes
"Will the 13"" sleeve work with the new 13"" Retina MacBook Pro?","Yes, this exact case fits my Late 2013 Retina MacBook Pro perfectly, and should fit any other 13"" Retina MacBook Pro, since they are the same size. It's a very exact fit, with no slop - not too tight, but not too loose either."
Can you place your MBA 2013 on the sleeve while using it? (other cases with magnets claim that the magnets cause the MB to go into sleep mode),I actually do that quite often. It's sitting on the sleeve now.
"If the new 2013 MBA already has a rubberized case on it, would it still be able to fit in the sleeve case?","It is a tight fit with no case on it, so it would be a gamble. The longer I the more stretched it becomes, and thus it might fit with time."
"Will this fit the macbook pro with retina 13.3""?","Yes, wonderfully well! The best case I can imagine. Looks nice and protects well. I got it in brown and love it!"
"What's the weight of this 13"" sleeve (considering it for my Mac Air and want to keep travel weight low)?","I don't have a scale to weigh the sleeve but based on simply using it, I would guess that it weighs about 50% of the Macbook Air 13"". I do not find it cumbersome in any way and it looks very professional when I pull it out of my briefcase or carry it into a meeting."
Does the inside scratch the macbook at all?,No not at all
"does this or any other case have carrying handle - Otherwise, you have to carry it tucked under your arm??",No carrying handle .
is the back pocket big enough to hold the charger for macbook air 13?,"No it isn't. The back pocket is very accomodating for keeping 20-30 document pages nicely protected, but something as bulky as the charger wouldn't work well at all. It's a very nice product for the price, but you'll just have to pack the charger elsewhere."
i have a 17 inch will it fit,"No it will not; I have a Macbook pro 13 (non retina) and that size is maximum this bag will take, however, I will say that the product is absolutely very nice"
"Would it fit an older model MacBook Pro 13"" - the one without retina display?",I don't think so. Retina MBP is already a very tight fit.

are these earbuds the actual real ones from samsung or just fake knock offs?,"Certain sellers are selling knockoffs, and some are selling the real thing. However, I've owned three pairs of these, and all have broken quite quickly, so I highly recommend buying a different set of earbuds."
Is Mic available on this earphone? If yes then can we control the volume? Can we pickup and drop the call while driving?,"Yes, it has volume-control +/_ , and on/off switch as well."
Does it work with laptops and/or desktops?,"Most computers have separate inputs for audio and voice, whereas this headset is designed to be used with a phone which has a single input for both audio and voice.

Anybody take the 2800mAh model apart to replace the 18650 battery? I have an AW protected 3400mAh 18650 battery I would like to use instead.,"Hmm, I never do that. Try to ask other people."
does it have google play,"Yes, it comes with Play Store installed"
will this phone work in Saudi Arabia?,"Not sure as I'm not sure of the 3G frequency used in SA. One SIM slot is the WCDMA/HDPRS/3G and the other is GPRS/2G I believe. So your data SIM needs to be 3G and other SIM GPRS. CDMA like that used in USA, Japan and Korea won't work."
Is this phone unlocked or it's an international version?,"its unlocked Chinese version, no updates possible."
"Hello, It's phone have a dual sim-card feature, Is possible use Verizon and Cricket at same time?",hello yes it have daul sim

"Hi, could you chose to buy only the colors you want and not pay the full-price? Thank you!","Hi Thuong! Unfortunately, all of our sets that you see listed are pre-packaged and stored in Amazon warehouses, so we cannot break up the sets and sell certain colors on their own. Apologies for that. If there's anything else, just let me know. I can be contacted directly via this link:"
Do you get all of the colors of the silicone ones?,"Hi Thuong V.! Maureen here from The Friendly Swede:-) Yes all ten colors come in the bundle! Any further help you need, please contact us here:"
will these covers fit the Verizon lg optimus phone?.,"Hi Doris! Yes, these cases will fit the LG Optimus L9 (T-Mobile). Let me know if I can be of more help here at this link:"
does it work with the metro pcs version too,"Hi Manuel! From what I can find online, it looks like Metro PCS and T-Mobile have merged, so you should have no problems at all. Kindly, Jessie / The Friendly Swede"
I don't know the difference between a 'soft silicone rubber skin' and a 'silicone gel cover'. Are they the same the same thing? Which is softer?,"Hi GinnefurLynn! There are no differences between the two descriptions that I am aware of. I believe different companies may simply use different terms. All silicone cases have a rubber/gel like feel. My only hunch is that ""gel"" may insinuate a bit of transparency? That is my two cents :) If there's anything else, just let me know. I can be contacted directly via this link:"
"Does the Matrix2 offer multipoint support? In other words, can I connect (via) to my tablet and phone at the same time?","Just to clarify, the Matrix2 does not offer multipoint support. It seems that this feature was not added when they upgraded from Matrix to Matrix2. That said, I confirmed with a technician at MEEElectronics that you can simultaneously connect one device by Bluetooth and another by hardwire. For example, I wanted headphones that would allow me to watch videos on my laptop while also notifying me of any incoming phone calls. This can be accomplished by connecting to my laptop via Bluetooth and to my smartphone using the cable that's included. Hope this helps."
I see people say these sound good but can we get more information on how good they sound. How do they compare to other known headphones $300 and under,"They sound terrific. I love the sound of these better than my wired V-Moda headphones but there is a known issue with phone calls constantly disconnecting and re-connecting. The manufacturer is aware of it and recommended the earlier version if I wanted to have functional bluetooth phone calls but the earlier model has more bass. I enjoy the sound so much that when a call comes in, I prefer to plug in a cable if the call is going to last more than 2 to 3 minutes which is when the bluetooth connection starts to drop."
is there a warrantee?,Yes. Mine broke so I contacted the seller and they sent me new ones.
Does this fit over (not on) your ears?,"It would depend on the size of your ears. For most people it fits over, not on."
Is there a way to use it on devices without bluetooth connectivity? I mean a TV for example. (and without using the cable as well).,The only way to use these headphones is through the bluetooth or the provided cable. But you can get a Bluetooth transmitter and hook it through your tv or stereo to work with the headphones. I did this and watch movies while I work. I have been very happy with this solution. Highly recommended.
"I mostly listen to EDM, rap, hip hop, dubstep, etc. Is the overall listening experience for these headphones better than Beats especially with bass?","I haven't listened to Beats a lot - I tried them in the store and wasn't impressed, esp given the price... So it's hard to say if these are better, I wouldn't say they are worse and certainly don't have any complaints about the sound quality for the price - I listen to a lot of EDM as well. They can be a little uncomfortable after a while, the ear pads are a little thin and they actually rest on my ears even though my ears are completely covered."
Are this headphone OEM version of this Nakamichi BT304? http://www.amazon.com/Nakamichi-Over-...,I have the Nakamichi and wondered the same. They certainly look almost identical except for the carbon fiber accents on the Matrix2. Spec wise though the Matrix are bluetooth 4.0 with aptX etc. and the Nakamichi are 3.0 so they look like more of a twin with the Meelectronics Venture. In addition Nakamichi's website has a new version that is Bluetooth 4.0 but doesn't mention aptX.
"what type of battery do these headphones have ?? how is it recharged, and is it replaceable without having to send them to the shop ?? Thanks","The battery is not replacable - at least it's not accessible in anyway that I can see. I understood when I bought it that once the rechargeable battery stops charging, it's time for a new headset. It is charged by plugging it in to any USB port. In my opinion these are great headphones for the price. Even though I'll have to replace it eventually (3-4 years??) I could buy 4+ of these for what I'd pay for other headphones. They're not noise cancelling but the sound quality is excellent."
"Do these headphones have anything boosted (bass, treble?) I'm looking to use them for DJing and watching movies .","No, the settings are not programable. They do sound great for streaming music off Pandora and great for movies off of my laptop with no lag in sound. Not so sure if they would work well for DJing."
"In terms of the sound quality, speakers, and audio reproduction only (not the other features), how do these compare to the brand's Venture headphones?","I strongly believe ""you get what you pay for"". I've had a few headphones that were &lt;$100. They were okay and it was all I could afford. I upgraded to Bose (@$350). I loved them but they were bulky, I hated the wire, and they were hard to pack for flights because the case was big. The MEElectronics wireless have been great for me. Terrific sound, light weight, and the cost was affordable. If it was me, and I had the extra $50, I'd go for the Air-Fi Matrix vs. the Venture"
this device and can connect headphones Plantronics BackBeat GO 2,Yea
Can the device be used while plugged in / charging?,Nope... that is a draw back
"If plugged to USB charger, does this turns on automatically once you start the car? Or do you have to turn it on each time you get into the car?",It turns on by itself. I love it!!!
Will this interfer with built-in bluetooth in car for handsfree calls?,"Yes and no, it does support the handfree Bluetooth profile. If your phone Bluetooth setting supports the ability to set this to music only, than you will be fine."
"Does it support HFP, so you can just tell Siri to dial a number or play music for you?","You can't call siri up using the button (at least I haven't found a way), but if you start siri you'll have a mixed experience. Sometimes it's workable, other times it hinders use. Most times expect to have to use it a couple times unsuccessfully before you get a successful use. Also, while using navigation you'll get cut off instructions from Siri turn by turn. I get around this by playing Spotify, Pandora, Music, etc. while using GPS. It seems having that playing stops the cut off audio issue. Not sure if it's a Bluetooth issue or a software issue."

The lightening end looks shorter. Does this work with the case on.,I used this with my iPad mini covered with the Griffin Suvivor case. No problems whatsoever.
Would this cable work for IPad 2?,As long as the IPad 2 uses the lightning connector and not the 30 pin it should be fine. The cord is really thick and durable. It is not reversible like the apple cords are though or atleast mine isent. You have to try out both sides to see which charges it.

If you need a $995 3 foot long HDMI cable, Pangea has it! I really don't think there will be a problem with the quality and service life of this product!"

is it fine with Samsung Note 2 always ? Charging and Data transfer ?,"Data is fine. For charging, it only delivers 0.5 Amps, so charging will be much slower than with the 2 Amp cable supplied with the phone."
is this truly a Samsung product for note 6,"Well, there isn't a note 6, last note out is the note 3. And yes it will work on the note 3, however it is not usb 3.0 so it will not charge as fast as the note 3 charging cable."

"Hi! Really new at buying a phone off the internet so this will be a stupid question, but does the BlackBerryQ10 come with it's own new sim card?","Hello, The one that I ordered *did* come with a SIM card - I don't know if there is a guarantee that all of them will ship with a card, but I think it probably should. The card is the new ""micro"" size, I believe, so I couldn't just stick my old one into this phone. However, t-mobile makes it super easy to activate the new SIM (or ""update"" your SIM information into a new card...same phone number and stuff). Search for ""activate tmobile sim"" on google, and it's like the third link. Here's the link (hopefully Amazon doesn't remove it) - http://support.t-mobile.com/docs/DOC-4677. Hope that helps :)"

My external battery stopped working. I get a message now that it is not compatible with the Iphone. Any fix for this?,Just contact the seller and they will exchange it out for you.
I just got the case today. How long does it have to be charged before use?,I charged it overnight till all four lights were lit. Thats a full charge
How do you correctly charge this device? I charged it over night and it is not charging my phone still.,"When you plug it in to charge, you must press the button to the right of the 25. Then the 25 will glow solid. This means it's charging your phone. Once your phone is 100% it will switch and charge the battery backup device (and the numbers will blink). Once the backup battery is done charging itself, it doesn't switch back to charging to phone. I think this is a design flaw. So if you don't press that button when you plug it in, it only charges the backup battery device."
does it had a power on and off button,Yes it does have a power button.
Can you charge the case and the phone at the same time?,Yes
How many charges or months of use before this case no long takes a charge?,"in one month , but i just use 5 or 8 time..."
what is a good headphone adapter?,I purposely avoid products that require adaptors. I believe that when you require an adapter it's a sign of either lazy or just bad design. Enough reason to avoid that product.
"I charged my case for more than 10 hours, but it's not working!! It doesn't turn on when I plug in the Iphone. I think it's broken =(","Have you tried hitting the power button located in the lower right hand corner right next to the number ""25""? Yes, that's a button, it pushes in and *clicks* which turns it on or off. You can turn it off and use your iPhone battery or you can turn it on and recharge your iPhone. While plugged in, pushing the power button to turn the battery case off redirects electricity directly to your iPhone charging it and pushing it again will redirect electricity to charge the case's battery and disconnects from the iPhone. Also, the amount of time that it takes to charge depends on your charger block. If you're using a USB 2.0 port, it's only pushing out 500mA, which will take 8 to 10 hours to charge, while using a 1000mA charging block, which comes standard with the iPhone lightning connector can charge your battery in half that time. It takes 4 to 5 hours to fully charge my battery case using Apple's standard 1000mA charging block."
Is the case charged through lightning cable or usb cable?,Lightening cable. The USB port is there so you can charge other devices with the case

"Some of the buyers of this product has a 802w m7 htc one (2013), just wanted to know if it fits perfect to size? thanks",Yes
"Why does this case look exactly the same as the one from i-Blason? Logo on back is shopped with ""Power Bank"" instead of ""iBlason"".",Those cases may come from the manufacturer. We don't know why they look the same.
Is there a monthly cost with Sprint?,I don't think that this device would work with Sprint. It is a GSM device.
"Will it work with my Samsung Galaxy Tab 4, android tablet?",Yes... in fact it will work with any device with WiFi capability.
"how can you get replacement charging cords for it, or can you use a cell phone cord for it?",I use either my cell phone or tablet cable (micro USB) without any problems
"Will this device work with at&amp;t ""Go"" prepaid service? Meaning I buy the device, the SIM, and a Prepaid Card and it should work?","O yeah, absolutely. I have had mine for a year and can get wifi connection for all my devices. Go for it!"

length of cable?,"I ordered from ""Mango Wireless"". It's 59-1/4"" from tip to tip including the plugs on each end. The cord itself is 57"" (i.e., 4' 9"")."
"For those who received a good product that charged the phone fast and were satisfied, which buyer did you choose?",Cell2U4Less
"What product is this listing even for? I want the Samsung charger, but it seems there are a dozen other ones in the same listing? Seems deceptive.","I am guessing these are factory defective chargers that didn't pass inspection. The ""2 amp"" charger I received only puts out about 0.6 Amps. The ""2 amp"" charger I received with my Note 3 puts out 1.8 amps."
Is it include the USB cable ?!,Cable and plug included
will this work with galaxy tab 3?,"Yes, It will work with the tab. They are essentially the same product."
Does this cable work with Samsung Galaxy S2?. Also will the charger supports 110 v to 240 v?,"The charger supports 100-240V, and I am not sure if it is compatible with the Galaxy S2. My guess would be it will work, since it works with the Galaxy S3 and S4."
Why does Mango charge over $9.00 for shipping??,"When I bought mine from Mango, I was not charged shipping at all. If I remember correctly, it was a Prime item."
"Will this charge a Samsung galaxy tab 3 - 8""?",I only used it to charge my samsung note 2....don't know about the Galaxy tab 3
Can I charge the note 4 with the fast charge with this?,i have Galaxy S 4 its very slow charging it
I purchased my mount back in February. It has worked wonderfully. Yesterday the neck snapped off while driving. Any chance of a warranty?,"Doubt it, this is a design flaw. Read my review. I really wanted to love this device but they should have used metal instead of plastic at the stress point. You can Super Glue this together, not a great option but I did it to mine and it's holding so far. I used a gel type super glue, figured it would handle vibrations better. So far it's held for 4 months. I would however recommend to anyone buying this to carefully take the little screws out (VERY CAREFULLY), and putting a few drops of super glue under the connection and replacing the screws. The weak point is the screw housing tubes, they are plastic and will eventually break. I figure that if you glue before it breaks, it will relieve the stress on the plastic."
I have read some reviews which indicate that the phone shakes in the mount when driving even on smooth roads. Anyone else experience this?,"Hi, nope, so far no shaking, when you slide the flat part into the CD player, there is a knob that you turn on the bottom, and it locks the phone holder in very tight, so there is no shaking. I drive on the highway daily and I don't notice any shaking of the phone"
will the magnet affect the smart phone and its data?,"No, the magnet will not affect the phone in anyway. It will prevent you from charging wireless if you have a wireless charger like the qi"
Has anyone used the InfiniApps Slyde with a VW Golf (2011) just looking for tried/true for this vehicle. Thanks.,I have a 2012 golf gti with the Rcd 310 head unit (non -nav) and it works great. Perfect location. The other head units don't differ too much in the location of the cd slot I believe.
"if using the mount with a charger plug, does the weight of the plug shift the phone if used in landscape mode?","No. The weight of a charging cord is not enough to affect the mount. If you pull the cord I'm sure you could get the phone to shift, but equally likely you'd either pull the plug out or damage your charging port."
"do the magnets mess with functionality of credit cards, if your phone and wallet are near each other, say in a purse, when the phone is not mounted?","No, your phone has a metal plate, not the magnet. The magnetic part is on the large piece that attatchs to your CD player. In any sense I think it takes a large magnet to mess with your stuff."
Does it hold a HTC One?,"Do folks answering this question actually tried it on an HTC One? If you didn't try it, you may not know that the HTC One has a curved back. The magnet would be touching only one point of that metal plate if the plate is glued on the back. If the plate is in between back and case... maybe, depending on how flexible the case is. Can anyone with actual experience answer this question?"
"So if your phone if made out of metal like the HTC One or iPhone 5, would you still need to attach the adhesive piece of metal to the back?",Most metals are not magnetic. It would have to be made of a steel that is.
Does this work with the Nexus 5? The phone already has magnets inside and supports QI charging.,I don't see why it wouldn't. The s5 also has some magnates and it works no problem.
Does this work with the existing metal pieces in the Nexus 5? I don't want to put a piece of metal in front of my NFC (I actually use NFC).,"No. It does hold, but it is very week hold. A sharp turn, a speed bump, or a gravel road will shake off the mount. You definitely need the plate; but the plate will interfere with wireless charging if you don't place it perfectly.... so if you use a wireless charger at home or at the office, honestly i'd avoid this item."
I purchased my mount back in February. It has worked wonderfully. Yesterday the neck snapped off while driving. Any chance of a warranty?,"Doubt it, this is a design flaw. Read my review. I really wanted to love this device but they should have used metal instead of plastic at the stress point. You can Super Glue this together, not a great option but I did it to mine and it's holding so far. I used a gel type super glue, figured it would handle vibrations better. So far it's held for 4 months. I would however recommend to anyone buying this to carefully take the little screws out (VERY CAREFULLY), and putting a few drops of super glue under the connection and replacing the screws. The weak point is the screw housing tubes, they are plastic and will eventually break. I figure that if you glue before it breaks, it will relieve the stress on the plastic."
I have read some reviews which indicate that the phone shakes in the mount when driving even on smooth roads. Anyone else experience this?,"Hi, nope, so far no shaking, when you slide the flat part into the CD player, there is a knob that you turn on the bottom, and it locks the phone holder in very tight, so there is no shaking. I drive on the highway daily and I don't notice any shaking of the phone"

"Does it really keep the water out, could you like drop it into a pool?",I would say yeah. I never went that far. but I've have submerged the case in a BIG bowl of water for an hour and it came out completely dry on the inside.
is this the lifeproof case?,No it's not. It have to say lifeproof case. That's what I put in the search engine.
does this case protect samsung galaxy III from drops? (Is it impact resistant?),"u would say that it does. its a very bulkie case. compared ti how thick it is I can't see it breaking or cracking the phone itself. but I will say this, you really have to press down hard in order to work the phones touch screen. the window of the caes is that thick. I have ended up taking it off cause of that"
"I don't see a box for color choice, may I choose the color of the case if I purchase one?","yes. take the order ,and tell me color"

does it have a built in screen or do i have to buy a screen protecter,"The case I received had the screen protector built I to the inner shell, much like the Otterbox."

Is it made of real leather or fake leather? I'm a vegan so I don't buy real leather... Thanks.,I wouldn't even call it leather. More like plastic.

does this fit the iPhone 5c?,Yes
How long will it hold a charge when the power is out?,"It holds a full charge for a long, long time. I had it in the bottom of my purse for well over a month or more, fully charged, and when I turned it on like 4-6 weeks later? STILL FULLY CHARGED! I was amazed to say the least."
Can I charge my Kindle Fire?,"Yes, it will work for the Kindle Fire. It comes with an USB cable that has a combo MicroUSB/Apple 30-pin connector on the one end."
will this charger also work with an ASUS 300 tablet?,This bat pack had 2usb slots to charge stuff. It also has a short cord that charges most Android phones.
How long will the charger hold its charge without recharging?,"I haven't had mine long enough to tell but anecdotal observations indicate that the batteries/unit seem to follow the ""standard"" Lithium discharge rate of 5-10% a month. Wikipedia and Google can lead you to more ""in depth"" analysis if you want......I find it helpful to just think of it as a big cell phone battery (can I leave my cell phone off for a month and turn it on etc). The key to storage is temperature (cooler is better then warm), you really start to digress into the more ""in depth"" stuff as soon as you ask the question :0 Sorry if that is not specific enough I tried to explain ""it depends"". Overall I have found the unit/device to be of high quality and am unsure as to what an $80 10400mah battery would offer over this one. There very well may be nuance's but for the average and above average user you won't be able to tell the difference."
Is it for android phones? Can it charge the battery in one single charge? Does it need a USB connector to it?,"Yes, it is for android phones. I have a droid phone. No, it doesn't need a USB connection. A charging cord is nicely wrapped around the phone and for other types of phones such as an iphone, a charging cord comes with it. It charges the battery quickly. I am loving it!"
does it charge a samsung note 3,Yes it does...
Does the adapter fit the iphone 4S if it has a Lifeproof case on it?,"I have an iPhone 4 with an otter box defender case, probbaly one of the biggest cases out there and it fits fine, the adapter is essentially like the regular charging cable."
Is it compatible for the iPhone 5s?,Yes.
Can you charge your iphone while listening to music?,"Yes, you can use your phone or tablet while re-charging your battery."
What is the warranty?,No it was the price. It works great and was a good investment
Does this work for iphone 5s?,"Yes, I have the 5S and it came with a case that fits it. I love this thing!!! Running a half marathon on Sunday with it."
Does the velcro really secure the phone to your arm - even if you are doing higher intensity exercise such as running?,"Yes. The wrist band holds very well. The velcro connection between the case and the wristband holds very well. I ran into issue where the adhesive between the velcro patch and the case came unglued when I was pulling the case from the band. I believe this was due to moisture while I was running. I don't believe it would have detached during the run, but seems that at times the velcro hold could be stronger than the adhesive hold and you will need to be careful when pulling apart. Otherwise, the holds are very strong."
Could I use it with a Lifeproof case on my iPhone 5s?,No
Is it easy to pull off mid run to change a song or something and reapply without slowing down?,No. But you can just rotate it to the inside of your wrist and work the keypad (if you can do that while you're running).
Does this fit the 5c?,I don't use the case. I cut the Velcro in half and stuck it to the phone. It works great and will not fall off when biking or running.
Does this work with the IPod Touch 5th Generation?,I returned my mine because it was cheaply made.
Will this work for a Samsung Galaxy 3G?,"Umm, it says iPhone 5. That's what it works with."
Is the sound loud enough for a car?,If you want to listen to it in your car. I would say yes. This thing is small but it is very loud and clear. I love this thing.
Any beeping?,I've been the owner of this speaker for more than 3 months it never beeped or any weird sound
"Does this speaker have a loud tone/voice saying ""Ready/Connected/Not Connected"" or is it just a light? If there is sound, can it be disabled?",it has a loud tone/voice. not sure if it can't be disabled though.
What is the difference between this model and the B009N1RV9U?,"This one is bigger but lighter, and has bluetooth 4.0. I compare its sound to the one coming out from a mobile phone speaker. No bass, and as loud as a mobile phone. The B009N1RV9U is smaller, heavier and has an older bluetooth version, but it sounds 3 time better than the newer version, a lot louder and has bass. I recommend the B009N1RV9U."
can you use it with a tv that don't have blue tooth,dont see why not as long as the tv has an audio out then i think you can use the stereo jack provided and just hard wire the tv to the speaker.
"I'm seeking a device that can work in a conference room with 8-12 people around it, running off a laptop; can I select the specific b/t device?","First, volume level for that size of gathering should be fine.. this thing pumps out an amazing volume. It hooks up simply with a Bluetooth transmitter, but if your laptop does not have Bluetooth, it also comes with a short cord that can be plugged into the laptop's headphone jack."
"Just received my Sharkk bt 4.0, The package was in VG condition but there are several loose items rattling around inside the speaker. Is this correct or??",I don't think so. I have two and neither of them have rattle.
How can the battery be charged besides using a PC USB slot?,"An iPhone charger or a charger that has a USB input, but it must be the exact voltage as the battery."
what kind of battery does it have?,It has a rechargeable battery. A Micro USB charging cable is included in the package.
how long does it take to charge? i broke the LEDS and cant tell by them. Also will the battery over charge?,It takes about 20 minutes
What and when is the sound it makes,"It beeps each time charging starts (that is, you get the phone lined up on the charging pad.) However, with the wireless receiver that I have for the Galaxy Note 3, when its fully charged, it stops taking power and the charging pad disconnects. For some number of minutes, and then it decides to start charging again, and another beep. It gets annoying after a while. There is an LED that changes from green to blue when the charging pad and receiver in the phone sync up, so the sound isn't necessary. I opened mine up, and the small ""speaker"" is not easy to disconnect as it is a surface-mount device, soldered directly to the printed circuit board; there are no wires to easily cut. However, as I happen to have a hot air surface mount solder rework station, I just took the speaker part off the board and now have sweet silence. If you try this, make sure to use low air flow, as there is a 0603 sized capacitor component that I managed to blow off the board while removing the speaker, and I had to solder it back on the board."
I have a Samsung Note II in an Otterbox Defender case. Anyone know if this charger will work?,Works well with my Samsung S4 in the otterbox defender case
"Do you need it perfectly aligned, or just roughly centered will do? Does anyone have this working with an Otterbox Commuter case?","I use mine with my Droid Maxx inside a Trident Cyclops case (which is similar to an Otterbox Commuter), and I haven't had any issues with it. There's a ""sweet spot"" you will find, what I do is lay it about 2"" back, then slowly push it up until you hear the beep and the light turns blue. Also, if you have problems with slippage (fumbling in the dark, your cat is a jerk, etc.), try putting two or three small blobs of RTV silicone on the charger. Depending on the cure time, you can have it done by nightfall (or the next time you use it), it will give you extra slip resistance to keep your phone from sliding off the charger AND it won't interfere with the charge process."
How many Amp is this Koolpad? This info should be standard specs info but I don't see it anywhere.,Input is good up to 2.1A while the output is 500-700mA.
can you charge more than one phone on this charger? or does anyone know if there is a charging pad that can charge more than one phone?,You can only charge one Qi enabled phone on a koolpad Qi charger at a time.
Where can I find operating instruction . There was nothing in the package to describe its operation,I looked at the picture. Make sure you bend back the paper on the battery contact points otherwise it doesn't work.
I can't get it to align with my GS5. What am I missing? Does it require a setting to be changed or an additional part? Is set squarely on top.,"The galaxy s5 doesn't have wireless charging built in, you'll need a charging back or a Qi adapter card on the battery. I went with the Samsung back, but it makes the phone too thick for most cases to fit properly"
Is it OK to leave the Koolpad charger more or less permanently plugged in showing the green light ?,Yes

If the belt clip breaks off the case is it covered by warranty?,I have no idea. All previous Otterboxes for a variety of functions worked as described for as long as I had/have them.
Is this otterbox armor series holster only used with a belt.,Yes. It does not have a clip. You must slide your belt through. The only up side to that is you won't need to worry about the clip failing.
is this a belt clip that can be used with the otterbox armor series case?,Yes. It is made for the armor series.
can you use it on preserver series galaxy s5,This case sucks so bad.. It closes with two really weak magnets
Will my IPhone 5s in a Survivor case fit inside this case?,it will fit but it will flop around
does the holster pivot?,yes but the flap is not secure so there is a chance and a pretty good one that your phone can fall out of the case. I am not happy with my purchase of the case. you may like it though.
Will the iPhone 4 otter box fit inside the holster?,I believe it will the holster is very big
Would this holster fit to a dutybelt?,"Probably, but the two I had broke getting in and out of a vehicle. Better be light duty"
will this case work for OtterBox 77-25819 Defender ION Series Hybrid Battery Case for iPhone 4/4S,does this work with the big bulky otter box on your phone
"Will this case fit the Hyperion 7500mah battery, its the micro pac tech that is the same size as a 5200mah battery...thanks",Yes. I have this case and the Hyperion 7500mAh battery. Fits just fine.
"Will this case work with the 5200mAh batteries from Anker? The Anker batteries come with their own new back cover, I just need the case and holster.",That is the same dilemma that I had. The case and holster will definitely fit the battery.
"Will it work with a Hyperion 5800 mAh extended battery and back. With the case on, can you use the nfc feature?","I've learned that Seidio products only work with Seidio products...it may fit other brands(Hyperion), but you won't have access to some features. Hope that helps."
Will this work with the S4 Active?,"Not sure that it will. I would try something else. The battery is not much more powerful than the 2600 mAh s4 already comes with, the case is flimsy & the holster bulges out way too much."
will the case fit an Anker 7800 mAh battery on my s4?,"MOST, and I stress, most large size batteries will fit the same profile and in turn yes, this case. 7800 MAH seems pretty large, but worst case scenario you can send the case back. Amazon is great with returns."
How long did it take Seidio to release this? I'm trying to get a timeframe for the S5 version.,"I believe I got mine for my S4 2 to 3 weeks later, but not really sure. It maybe that I didn't really look for one right away."
"Hi! I purchased this item last year and need to replace the Holster portion, the case is still fine. Which listing is for this holster only?",I'm sorry I haven't come accross a listing for just the holster. It appears from the seidio website that they want you to fill out warranty forms for replacements. Maybe you might get one used from eBay or here?
How many coils does it have? Thank you,"only 1 so you will have to place your device precisely over the ""sweet spot"", this charging pad does seem to live up its claim for being able to charge through 8mm. i am using it with a galaxy s4 with an otterbox and it works just fine while most other pads i tried wouldn't work."
I see a cross out on the speaker icon. Are you saying this is a silent version?,"Unfortunately it is NOT a silent version. This unit charges well. However, it does beep frequently once charged. I cannot use it at home because it wakes me up. I contacted the company and there is no way to silence it. Very disappointing."
"Does this pad really keep the phone cooler than other pads? Or if you only bought this one, do you notice the phone getting particularly hot?",I only have experience with the Koolpad used to charge my Nexus 7 tablet. It does in fact run cool as the name would suggest. It works through about 3/8 inch air gap so no problem charging through my case.
"Can anyone provide dimensions? They frustratingly do not list it anywhere, and I want to see if this is thin enough to fit in a car cradle.","My Qi charger, bought about four months ago, is 10 mm thick, 148 mm long, and 80 mm wide. And it works great, too. Very happy with it. I do note that the one in the picture has a different decal on the top. Mine has a stylized ""qi"" logo, but is labeled ""Koolpad"". So, I cannot guarantee that they have not changed the design. It is listed on the back as the model T-100. I use it to charge a Nexus 7 -2 tablet, also bought about four months ago. There is no problem with matching the ""sweet spots"" on both the charger and the tablet to get a good connection, even though the tablet is considerably larger than the charger."
"Does it list Watts and Amps it runs on (""W"" &amp; ""A""). I.E. the Nexus wireless charger is 9W 1.8A","I didn't see any information about watts or amps. During the short time I had it I was only concerned about whether or not it would charge my Nexus5 as advertised. It did a fine job. I'm pretty low tech about electronics, so as long as it doesn't make my phone blow up, it's good enough for me."
Will this charger work on a new Moto Droid Maxx with the 3500mah battery?,"Yes, in fact that's exactly how I'm using it!"
could you tell me the dimensions? thanks,5 7/8 x 3 1/8 x 3/8 in inches
I am new to this ... do I need to also buy a charging receiver with this or a coil? not sure or i can buy just this???,It have to also by a receiver for what ever phone you have.
If I get the right back for the s5 and I put an outter box on it with it still charge,Yes
If it is working with my note 4 with the samsung S-view cover,"I think you are asking if it will work with the note 4 with the samansuns s-view cover, there is no reason why it shouldn't. I have the wireless back cover and have a case over the cover and it works fine."
How many coils does it have? Thank you,"only 1 so you will have to place your device precisely over the ""sweet spot"", this charging pad does seem to live up its claim for being able to charge through 8mm. i am using it with a galaxy s4 with an otterbox and it works just fine while most other pads i tried wouldn't work."
I see a cross out on the speaker icon. Are you saying this is a silent version?,"Unfortunately it is NOT a silent version. This unit charges well. However, it does beep frequently once charged. I cannot use it at home because it wakes me up. I contacted the company and there is no way to silence it. Very disappointing."
"Does this pad really keep the phone cooler than other pads? Or if you only bought this one, do you notice the phone getting particularly hot?",I only have experience with the Koolpad used to charge my Nexus 7 tablet. It does in fact run cool as the name would suggest. It works through about 3/8 inch air gap so no problem charging through my case.
"Can anyone provide dimensions? They frustratingly do not list it anywhere, and I want to see if this is thin enough to fit in a car cradle.","My Qi charger, bought about four months ago, is 10 mm thick, 148 mm long, and 80 mm wide. And it works great, too. Very happy with it. I do note that the one in the picture has a different decal on the top. Mine has a stylized ""qi"" logo, but is labeled ""Koolpad"". So, I cannot guarantee that they have not changed the design. It is listed on the back as the model T-100. I use it to charge a Nexus 7 -2 tablet, also bought about four months ago. There is no problem with matching the ""sweet spots"" on both the charger and the tablet to get a good connection, even though the tablet is considerably larger than the charger."
"Does it list Watts and Amps it runs on (""W"" &amp; ""A""). I.E. the Nexus wireless charger is 9W 1.8A","I didn't see any information about watts or amps. During the short time I had it I was only concerned about whether or not it would charge my Nexus5 as advertised. It did a fine job. I'm pretty low tech about electronics, so as long as it doesn't make my phone blow up, it's good enough for me."

"is this for the t-mobile style FLAT top, or the other carriers ROUND top model. from this image with it i can't tell which one its for",I have the virgin mobile one for the optimus f3 and its round.
is the back hard rubber?,It has a neoprene sleeve covered in hard plastic
How do I request for a specific case?,"Berny, Specific cases will have their own listings based on the cases own model number as well as what it is compatible with. If you do not see a case available, it is most likely that a particular case style is not made for certain phone models at the time."
is this for the tmobile lg optimus f3?,"yes, and I love it!"
Do they charge you a fee for not using your phone for a long time?,"They do not charge as long as it is the prepaid network only. You can use the phone intermittently. Just keep in mind when purchase minutes, the minutes will only last the duration of the card you buy."
Can i use this card to ACTIVATE my prepaid verizon phone?,Yes you can

I have an old unused samsung cell phone previously on verizon wireless. Can I buy a refill card and use this phone as a prepaid?,"Hi John, You need to go to Verizon to have it convert to prepaid SIM before you can use is as prepaid. Sincerely, Bargain & Savings"
Will the pin be delivered to my e-mail after purchase,"Yes, the pin will be delivered via email or loaded to your phone if you provide us your phone number."
if i got the $50 plan could i still purchase this one to use?,Yes. You would just have a $10 credit on your account
Will it fit the 5,You have to ask the seller. I just purchased a case for my galaxy 4
I am a little unclear of what s4 counts as a 'i9500 only' as it seems like several s4 models come up from puttin that number in google. Can you help,"The case we bought said it was for the i9500 and it fits my s4 perfectly. I also remember that was confusing. So, if you have the galaxy s4, it'll fit."
Will it fit the galaxy s4 active?,Yes that's what I have.
Do you have one for the S3 mini?,No I sure don't but it is pretty
Does this case fit model SGH M919 (Samsung S 4),Yes

Must have metal back cover and phone has square corners. In this pictures its rounded shape, speaker is on the right side at back and back cover is plastic. Also back camera on the middle. On original versiyon its on the left side.... Please give us an answer. are the pictures wrong or is this a fake product? I want to give order but I cant... Please update pictures or giv eus an answer..."
"another question,is this phone set to english? some people says its in chinese character. pls.reply.",english --yes.
What type of SIM card does it support?,micro
"i want to purchase this model, and how much does it has RAM memory?",It has 1 GB. See http://www.gsmarena.com/lenovo_p780-5544.php for all specs.
this cell works in venezuela?,"Yes, this phone is unlocked and can be used worldwide including Venezuela."
"I want to know if this phone also has the Spanish installed, is for use in Venezuela.",Hello Dear customer There is standard languages but not Spanish. Thank you
Is this phone unlocked? Will it work in Israel?,yes
I have a couple of questions for you. Is the phone factory unlocked? Is it compatible on the 4G network as some of the documentation only refers 3G,"Yes it is not blocked ,Only 3g"
does it work in Venezuela DIGITEL 3G? IS IT UNLOCKED?,"it can work in Venezuela 3G, is unlocked."
"I heard ""Network reception is a big flaw"" It juggles between 3G &amp; 2G &amp; u need to restart to get network. Is this correct ?","In the US it will only work on 2G or EDGE network. ATT is degrading its 2G network. However T-Mobile s network is working well. Look at the Bands they work on. 3G or HDSPA require 1900Mhz freq. The P780 is 2100Mhz on 3G so it isn't compatible in the US. Look at the Lenovo K900 as it works on US networks very high speed HDSPA+ almost 4G or LTE speeds. I have both the P780 & the K900. T-Mobile on the P780 for 2G. The K900, AT&T HDSPA+ very fast. Hope that helps"
"If I hook up these speakers via USB, can volume still be controlled by the computer or it needs to be controlled with the knob on the back of the speaker?",Yes. Set the speaker volume then use your computer output volume. They even power down when you shut the computer off.
"I like these speakers, but I already have a DAC; is hooking up these speakers (with their built-in- DAC) to a system with a DAC a problem?","If you use your existing DAC to send sound to the speakers, then you will input into the speakers with analog red/white RCAs, which will bypass the DAC inside the speakers. The internal DAC for these speakers is only accessed when you input signal via USB."
Do you need a high end sound card to have the full advantage of these speakers or does it not make a difference sense its usb connected? Thanks.,"From what I have read, better speakers would be a better investment before changing the sound card. Have a look at this forum. http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/58378-6-speakers-sound-card"
These or Bose Companion 3? Thanks,"I've developed a distrust for name brands, so on that sentiment alone, I'd go with the Audioengines. I can say from experience, though, that the A2+'s are amazing. They lack a little bit of bass, but that's to be expected, and I'm sure the Bose's would suck in that regard as well. Go with the Audioengines."
A2 vs Klipsch pro media 2.1? also does this A2 need a sub woofer?,"Well, you asked the right person, since I own and use both. While I love Klipsch generally, and regard it as overall the top value brand, (5.1 home theater, etc.) I was really blown away by the performance of the A2+. The only handicap I have in answering you is I've used the A2 with a sub controlled by an inexpensive but wonderful preamp (the gemini pa-7000) since day one. But this is revealing-- I had to reduce the crossover to only 80 cycles -- that's real speaker territory. So, I'd call the addition of a sub a nice add-on but far from necessary. If anything, I find these little guys a bit bassy if anything. Naturally, a lot depends on your environment. Mine's a kitchen -- very flattering acoustically. Bottom line is the A2+ is more the 'real deal' since you have the option juice it up, making it a 'system,' later. There's no hint of being 'just a computer speaker.' Overall, while I like my 2.1's fine, I love my A2s."
These don't come with a remote (for volume). Can you purchase one separately?,I don't think you can have a separate remote to control the volume for these... but rather you can buy a bluetooth audio receiver and hook it in and wirelessly stream audio to the speakers. Audio engine has a wireless transmitter and receiver but thats 150$. You can buy a belkin one for 20$ and it works perfectly for me.
How would you integrate a subwoofer into the system along with these speakers if your source just has RCA outputs and a line-out as 3.5mm?,"Dear Ian, Thank you for your question. The A2+ Premium has added a 3.5mmm variable output connection. Simply using a standard iPod connection cable (3.5mm to RCA left/right) will allow you to connect to a powered subwoofer. Please let me know if I can answer any additional questions for you! Regards, Eric Cohen World Wide Stereo"
Would these speakers be okay for a record player setup? I know the 5's would be better but would these do the job?,"I have the 5's in my home office and the 2's in my work office. Both are connected to the Audioengine sub and sound GREAT!!! Sound is personal and I like both setups that I have, but the 5's really bang, shake and sound incredible. The 2's are really good with my setup, but I can't really bring the house down at work."
you can plug any subwoofer into these speakers right? I have an extra sub lying around that I want to use instead of buying the as8 subwoofer.,The sub being used would need to have RCA inputs(how mine us currently setup). I guess you could rig up a splitter off of one of the speaker inputs. Or if your sub has input/output for speaker wire you could do that too.
"Mine sound great, but idle warm. Is that normal? I assumed they would ""sleep"" with no audio input.I'm using them with a USB input, and an iMac.","I got the same issue (connected with USB) plus, has static. The on/off control is in the weird location and many times I get the Static with a noise in the speaker. They even get sound when I turn on and off the light in the room. It never happened with the previous speakers."
does it run on 4g lte in the usa ?,"No, it does not"
does it come with 3g on band 1900? and with NFC?,Yes. It also depend on your country carrier network if they have 3G technology. NFC is a different technology on it own. Only works in certain countries
"Hello, I need this BB to work in Argentina. Do you know if it runs in my country? Thanks!","Hello, mine works perfectly in Venezuela, so I guess you won't have any problems with it in Argentina"
Does phone come with a warranty?,No
does it work around the world?,Yes it does! Perfectly well
Does this phone can work on T-Mobile 4G?,Yes it works with T-Mobile or att
I want to buy this phone today(as in right now) but still not clear on if this sqr100-3 version will work on att and anybody who knows which sqr i ne,"Yes it will work because my nephew has it but be aware it does not support 4G nor LTE, just regular 3G so it is kind a slow, just get the Q10 in white for the same price"
Will this Sqr100-3 unlocked version work for at&amp;t sim card and if not which version works for at&amp;t sim card??,"It is unlocked so it works with all the networks. att, tmobile etc It is an amazing phone!!"
will this phone work with boost mobile in the US?,Yes
is it compatible with verizon?,No
Is there anywhere just to buy the earbuds??,"Amazon is the only place I've ever seen them, I purchased a pair they are pretty good but a bit uncomfortable Ann buttons are not easy friendly. Also bought knives 420 and they are awsom"
will this work with iphone 5s??????,"After I read the specs of this stereo headphone and trying several other brands, that on my view failed; I decided to give it a try and it has exceeded all expectations. For the price you can't go wrong. In open spaces it has a reach of about more than ten feet +, Battery life is about 5 hours continuous play. I have a iPhone 4 and works perfectly, so I don't see why it wouldn't work for a iP5. Good Luck!"
"I have tried Plantronics and Motorola behind the head headsets, both too small for my fat head. How big are these headsets?",I wear a hat size 7 7/8 and they fit fine. But they do go around the back of your head and up and over your ears. I think they're pretty comfortable.
Is the item sweat/water proof?,"I can't speak to that for the long term, but let me tell you, I've tried them ALL. BluebudsX (160 dollars and useless for a variety of reasons, particular the whole ""earlock"" system, which is an awkward pain), the Motorola sport ones (never lasted more than a few months), Plantronics, you name it. I've been using these now for a couple of weeks, always in the gym, and I train hard, so I sweat heavy (hitting the bag, skipping rope, 5k four times a week, etc.). Not once have these ever disconnected or in any way cut out. As far as I'm concerned, right now, these are the best on the market."
does the belt snap on swivile,Yes it does
How good or bad is the belt clip on this gadget?,"A little bulky, but secure! No problems with it falling out."
This case was dropped recently and broke. Is there a warranty for this? It is less than a year old.,I drop mine all the time! Its really beat up but has never given out. I believe there is a warranty. I would Google Otter Box to find the answer. Hope this helps.
Will the S5 Active fit in the S4 Active case?,No it would not
Any solution to the appearance of condensation between the screen &amp; screen protector? It's not water or oil..very annoying!,Ive never had that problem. Im sorry. Maybe it is something to do with your environment? Or maybe yours isnt sealing correctly
how many pieces,"Came with 3.. but the rubber was bigger than the plastic, so it was loose."
do the ob come with a screen protector on it or do i have to buy the screen protector film to put on my phone,Yes it does
can you access the charger ports without disassembling the otterbox?,"Yes, as easy as it is without the ob on"
Does this item really take 5 to 8 weeks to ship?,Mine took about seven days.
Is this case waterproof,I doubt it. It isn't even dust proof. The phone should be tho.. the case has a gap where the menu keys are so you can see into the phone. Definitely not water proof
is the otterbox worth it? better brand?,the Otter box is very worth it I've tried many cases out there but none come close to a Otter box from dropping your phone to accidentally getting it wet and I am rough on my phone and my Otter box has taken everything I've thrown at it to say the least. ..you will not regret it I assure you
What size belts (what width of belt) will the holster clip on to?,"1 1/2"""
does it come with belt clip,Yes
does fit the Samsung s4? (as opposed to Samsung S4 active),"no is to big,is like 1/4 space cell go up /down"
what is the warrant on this product because my clip broke,1 Year. Go to Otterbox website for warranty claims.
Can I remove the built-in screen protector?,You can remove it but it's an intricate part of the of the case and snaps together with the back. I just remove to clean and then snap everything back together.
does this come with holster?,"Yes, it comes with belt clip."
Can we maybe get another color for s4 Active? Honestly. :(,They only made 2 for the active because it wasn't a heavily mass produced phone. I would have loved to see more color combinations but sadly otterbox only offered 2.
Does the belt clip swivel?,yes
$12.00 more for black . Why is that shouldn't be any different then the price of the white case .,Amazon needs to answer that
Is it AT&amp;T Sim card compatible,Yes is compatible and i very happy w this phone
"Would love to know if this phone could work on UK networks? Vodafone. Situation: Military and had to move, AT&amp;T is unhelpful with unlocking iphones.",Its unlock and all GSM channels can use. We take it back to HK is ok. I am not sure if it works in UK
Do you have one of this blu divas that uses standar size?,"This model uses a Mini SIM sized card, that is a standard sized SIM card."
Whats the size of the sim? Are they mini or regular size?,This model phone uses a Mini SIM sized card.

Mount the camera on your surfboard while you catch a monster wave or on your bike handlebars to capture yourself tackling an extreme mountain course.

"Do you have to remove protective cases from iPhone &amp; iPad?? If so, NO THANKS!!",No you dont.
Can I use this with a Samsung S4?,I dont know but actually...I bought the FUGEE wifi sound speaker with the 40 hr. battery and it sounds a million times better than this. Its not a porting station but now that I only use this for porting due to the sound difference.
Will it hold the Iphone with otter box cover?,I dont have an iphone i have a samsung galaxy s4 n when i charge it i do it with the hard case i got it in n i have no problem at all both phone have a protective hard case n they can b charge with no problem at all

Does this work for a Windows smartphone and Kindle Fire 7 HD?,yes
Does it work with iPhone 6 Plus,"YES, WORKS GREAT ."
Can you use this speaker as a speaker phone when the cell phone is attached to it?,"I think it depends on the device you are charging. If the speaker on that device can function when charging, then I think the answer is likely ""yes' to your question. This product is simply a charger."
"I know it charges, but ate the speaker used for music from the devices that are charging?","Yes, either the device that's charging or a device you have connected through bluetooth"
What is the speaker for?,This particular device can charge your phone. It also has bluetiith so it can play music from any smart device. I hope this was helpful

does this work with the slide out keyboard?,Yes.
Is the outside of the cover a hard plastic or is the outside of the cover rubberized?,Hard plastic. Durable and easy on/off. Pleased with quality and value.
since it is a hard case does it still protect like the rubber ones against drops on ground?,"I can't compare to the rubber cases for this particular phone. I can tell you it has survived my two sons and their regular dropping, and the phones are still working. It's been over a year."

Does this cover up the 'speaker' so you have to take it off to answer your phone?,No. There is a spot for the mic.
Do you have anything likethis for an S4 Active i9295???,"Sorry, we only make this case for the regular S4 and S5."
"Does the power button align well? On mine, it's slightly off and the button is always half-pressed.",yes both the power button and volume controls are align well inside the case.
When will the wallet case be available for the S4 Active?,"Unfortunately, we do not currently have any plans to develop any cases for the S4 Active as our resources are tied up in our current models. Thank you for your interest!"
"Does this fit the S4 active, too?",No this case does not fit active.
"How big is the speaker channel at the bottom? (I want to attach a wrist strap to it, and I was thinking I could cut a hole in the speaker channel)",I think it's doable. It's about half a cm.
Why would the speaker/mic be covered. Does this mean if you use speakerphone it doesnt work? Odd,"The speakers are hidden because the ""scoop"" looking thing translates the sound towards you not away from your ears."

How much protection does this offer from drops? I don't see much in the description. I'd love to hear from the company.,I have dropped my phone many a times and it always come out working
"How much bulk does it add to the phone? It shows .5"" thick, which would almost double the thickness. Is that accurate?","The wallet is extremely thin and appears to add no additional thickness when there isn't any cards/money in the wallet. This is due to a raised perimeter around the 'wallet pocket' that protects the phone and is incorporated into the plastic case. The wallet only holds three cards and I wouldn't suggest making this a primary use wallet as it is difficult to access. I keep a credit card, $20 bill, and gym ID and it works great."
"Once you've used the cover for awhile, do the cards/money fall out easily or do they stay secure? Others have a lip to keep the cards from falling out","I had the same concern, but you need not worry. The case is made of high quality material that isn't stretching over time/use. That being said, it probably makes sense to keep more than a couple of cards (or bills) to make it thick enough for it to not be an issue. The case is holding up great! Thanks for asking. -SEAN"
"is this for a 4 or an iphone 5. the ttle is different in the search and then when you click on it, says 4",neither is for the android galaxy s4
What material is the case made of for the CM4 Q card case for Galaxy S4,Leather like material. Very sturdy and good quality.
"Does it cover the speaker? If so, how does it effect the sound?","Nope theres a 'scoop' shape in the speaker area, if anything it enhances the sound deflecting it forward."
does it completely cover the front of the phone?,No
Will this work with Samsung Alpha?,I don't think that this will work.
does it work with Qi wireless chargers?,No its with cards in the back it won't work.

does it work with Qi wireless chargers?,No its with cards in the back it won't work.
will this case fit a samsung qwerty?,I doubt its specifically made for the S4 line
will it fit the s4 active?,No
Do you have this type of case for a samsung galaxy s3?,"Sorry, it's only available for the Galaxy S4 and S5. Time for an upgrade! :)"
Can you use this case with QI wireless charging?,"You can but the more card's or items you have in the case the slower your charge would be, depending on the receiver you have (back plate vs adapter) it may have issues going through credit cards, not to mention you may run the risk of demagnetizing your cards."
does it work on a galaxy s 3,Have no idea since we have a Galaxy 4 which it was made for. Sorry

"Does it work through a phone case?(relatively thin, not an otter box style case)",I Have been using it with the Otter box Defender case with out any problems. Other then you have to place it very carefully in the right place. I'm also using TYLT Vu Wireless Charger which I like better other then the price
this work with samsung galaxy note 3.?,"Yes, very well... even with a pretty thick case."
Whats the charging capacity in mAH,"Not sure, but I do know this, I have the note 3 and my wife the s4, and we use these, and we love it. Period. No bs"
will it work with the s4 active,"I don't have the active so I'm not sure. If the battery is the same, in that it is reached by removing the back it should. The induction coil fits between the battery and the case back, (the back will be a bit tricky to close and will bulge a bit.)"
will this work with the t mobile samsung galaxy s4?,"It works for sure with a Verizon S4, hardware - wise it shouldn't make a difference if it's T-Mobile or not."
"Does the chip fit with the original S4 cover, without making the case bulge?","Yes it does without bulging! It was a great option for me because i corroded my chargong port (water damage) and was too lazy to change it. It charges slightly slower than normal, and might get the phone hot if you have it at the wrong orientation, but is a great buy overall!"
Does this support NFC?,It does not interfere with NFC.
Does charging stop when battery if 100% charged?,"Yes. It works just like your wired charger (except it has no wires) with a few key differences: 1. Your phone limits the current received in this way (the limit is device manufacturer specific - my SG S4 will only take 700mA via its wireless charge port) 2. The QI wireless charging standard limits the max current to 1000mA. 3. The phone will charge fully (within the limits above), turning ""off"" the wireless charging port when done. The thing is, then the phone almost immediately starts to deplete the battery, and the charging resumes (speaking ONLY from experience with my device). The final net effect is your phone enters a ""floating battery"" state: the charger is powering your device, while your battery sits idle at 100%. I have left my S4 on the charging pad overnight many times, the same way i have left it in the wired charger overnight many times... same result either way - phone works just like it did previously, just the way i know it to work."
I dropped my Galaxy S4 in water and now it won't recognize any charger that goes into the USB port. Will this work if the USB port doesnt work at all?,Yes. That is what happened to my wife's phone and that is why we bought the wireless charger.
"Do you guys hear any noise when charging your phones? There's an high pitch, low volume squeek squeek coming from the charger when charging.","No, but the one I got never did work. Kept turning on and off and on and off.. and that's with the phone itself. Forget about using it with your phone cover."
will it hold an iphone that is in a case?,"Yes, it's pretty smartly designed. The clamps are spring based so you just wedge your phone in and it opens up farther while still applying a grip. Therefore, a little extra space needed (such as a case) is not a problem."
Does this transmitter work with an Iphone 4s and Ipod Nano?,"Yes, this transmitter will work with both devices. But the cable that is advertised, is for the iphone 5, 5s, 5c and recently new ipod device that uses lightning cables to charge it up."
Do you think it can be used with a Galaxy Samsung Phone?,"The lightning cord cannot, of course, but any device with a USB cable can charge off the unit"
Can you rotate the phone so that it sits upright (and not horizontal as shown in the pics)?,"Actually I use it with an iPod 5th generation vertically. It works quite well. It has very good quality of sound, the only thing that I don't like is the flexible support is not really flexible, no matter how you bend, it will always go back to its original position after a while. Regards, Quentin"
Is there an audio output cord included in the package to connect the phone to the FM transmitter? Or can I do that via bluetooth?,The audio output jack is connected to the unit itself. That plugs into your phone. You can't connect via Bluetooth with this unit but Amazon offers others that can.
Anyone know how to make the unit work better for people on the other end to hear me better? Seems like it uses the phones mic. Iphone5s,I have not had people complain about hearing me. Make sure you are not blocking the mic with the clamping brackets. I also use Bluetooth in my car to hear and talk. Not sure if bluetooth will help you if you have it in your car.
will this work with older radio systems?,Not sure what you mean by older. It works in my 2002 ford
"With an iPod plugged in via Lightning, will audio be transmitted over the lightning/USB cable, or will I still need to separately plug in 3.5mm audio?",you have to plug it in separately.
Can anyone advice if this product is compatible and can hold iPhone 6 Plus?,yes
Can this device hold iPhone 6 easily,Yes. It is a tight grip.
What are the dimensions of the size product that it fits?,iPod 4th generation
"i have a question, first of all i love this case and i want it fir my birthday and everything.Should i trust DeLea or roben???","We ordered three at the same time, we received two quickly, owl and bubble bee the monkey took forever to get"
Does the case actually stand with the ipod in it? Or does the picture just make it look like it does?,The picture just makes it look like it stands but it doesn't.My daughter ended up tearing up the pins were she had to charge it because the opening was to small.We tried to get it fixed but we couldn't.It is cute but it's not worth the price of her IPOD.
Does the case actually stand with the ipod in it? Or does the picture just make it look like it does?,"It doesn't. The case itself is not one that I would recommend. Although it's adorable, it doesn't fit snug and provides no security."
Will this work on a Samsung Galaxy Note 3,"I do not have a Galaxy Note, but I cannot see why the lens shouldn't work. It is rather adaptable, and works on other Samsung products which are not too dissimilar from the Note 3. For the price, and what it can do for you if it does work, it is worth the shot."
Does it work on the Motorola Droid Mini?,"Dunno, I have Samsung smartphones, but it appears to be pretty adaptable."
does it fit HTC1 8,Fits HTC EVO and has room to expand should fit any standard phone setup up can be a little clumsy depending on were camera is located on phone have fun
"Is the level of zoom adustable, or is it always zoomed all the way?","Didn't work for my Sony Xperia Z3, but it's adjustable for clarity not zoom in nor out. Hope it helped."
"I was thinking about making youtube videos with my iphone 5c, would this be a good option?",I doubt it. I found it to be a bit crude and not worth the trouble to put it on the phone. I gave it to my son in law.
Dones it work on the Galaxy S3 mini?,No me gusto...
does it work with the Iphone 5?,i HAVE A SAMSUNG SORRY CAN'T HELP
Will this work with G2?,"I purchased this to use with a Galaxy S4. The lens itself works great and can work for really any phone. The issue is with the clip that holds the lens in place. The bracket sometimes presses the function buttons on either side of the phone (volume, power) and makes it tricky to take pictures. I modified the clip to fit my phone and it works great."
Will it work with IPhone 4S or a IPad (not air)?,"It doesn't ""work"" at all. There's literally no deference between my zoom and using this thing. The mount definitely won't fit an iPad."
Is situable for Xperia Z 1?,"Not really, we tried it and its a bad fit. Also, when you do find the good spot for the lens, the camera has a hard time focusing. I would look elsewhere, this was a good fit on older Samsung phones."
will this work with Boost mobile samsung galaxy S2 4G?,I'm sorry! I just saw you question! If Boost is made like the Sprint S2 then it will fit!
Would this fit the Samsung Galaxy S II Skyrocket (T-Mobile)?,I'm not certain of it will fit the T-Mobile version. Mine is the Sprint version and it fits it perfectly. I know there are different models. The model of my phone is Samsung Galaxy SII D710. I hope this helps. :)
is this comparable to the otter box? does it hold up really good? and can i take the screen protector off like i did with the otterbox?,I never had a otter box so I don't know. It works get for me!
will this work on samsung galaxy s2 t989 from tmobile?,No only for sprint galaxy 2. T-Mobile galaxy 2 is bigger.
How long are the cords?,iphone 5 about 3 feet
hey can i just get the 10 split in red blue black white green so itl be two of each . i don't like the other colors,Yes we can do that
will i get 10 pcs for that price above?,"Yes, you get 10 cords, each a different color."
Can the Amazon Lightning Cord fit with this product?,"Yes, there is a large space for the charger"
Does this work with a screen protector?,"I have the film type screen protector on my phone with this case, no problems."
I've had rubber cases in the past that I didn't like because the rubber would stick to/pull on my hair. Will this be a problem with this product?,"Well it doesn't stick in my pocket at all. It's not a sticky silicone, so I would imagine it wouldn't do that at all. Hope that helps! I actually tried pulling my hair with it and it absolutely did nothing so I think you're good!"
does it fit the Iphone 5?,"It fits it perfectly (I have the iPhone 5) but like I said, it gives it minimum protection. I wouldn't recommended to anyone who was clumsy."
Does the clear plastic affect image quality?,"No, the clear plastic is just on the back; there's a cutout for the camera lens."
will it interrupt the new iphone 5s flash?,The Ringke Fusion case works great with the 5s. No problem with the flash and the case is screen protector friendly.
Does it work with iPhone 5c?,Ringke Fusion has a specific case for 5c. Please follow the link below http://www.amazon.com/RINGKE-Selling-Absorption-Scratch-Premium/dp/B00EA1XINQ/ref=sr_1_6?s=wireless&ie=UTF8&qid=1383767419&sr=1-6&keywords=ringke+5c+case
How does the case fit with a skin/design on the back of the phone?,"Sorry, I didn't add anything in. But as long as it's thin, I imagine it would be fine."
Does this case have a loop to attach a lanyard?,yes
Is anyone using this case with a dock? I'm looking for a basic dock that will be compatible with this case.,The only downfall in my book. :(. Doesn't seem to be dock compatible.
"are the sides flexible, do they have a soft feel when gripped?",No it's not flexible at all. But it's not thick and bulky so I really like it durability of it. I think you'll really enjoy it. My boyfriend got one too
Does the case cover the front screen also?,no just the back and sides
Ringke Fusion or Luvvitt Clearveiw?,I don't have experience with the luvvitt...but I definitely would pick ringke fusion! I dropped my phone yesterday and NOTHiNG is scratched/broken :) made my day.
Got this in mint a couple weeks ago and I'm wondering how to clean it? It's SO dirty and nothing is removing the dirt/make up off of the mint bumper.,I've been using pure acetone nail polish remover and windex. They take off most of the nasty dirt but some of it is stained into the bumper.
"Can this be used just as a bumper, without the back clear plastic protector?","No, the case is one piece. But with the back being clear it gives the appearance of being just a bumper with the added protection of the back cover."
Does the champagne match the gold 5s?,"I think it looks better with the silver, but teal and gold tones are really in right now. Totally rockible."
I dropped my 5C and the back case is coming off in right upper corner. Can this be fixed?,"I don't suggest fixing it because if the right upper corner is coming off, then it won't protect your phone the next time you drop it. Just buy another one, they're cheap anyway."
should I get this case even if all of the comments say it gets dirty? is it worth it or should I keep looking?,"I have had the case nearly a year. Dropped the phone several times and am generally rough on the phone. And, yes I clean it from time to time, but not more than other cases. For the price, I would buy again."
hi can you tell me if this fits a 5c? i absoloutly love the mint green.,Well I have an iPhone 5s and fits perfect not sure about an iPhone 5c
Does this case have any texture or grip to it? Or is it very slick causing it to slide out of your hands often?,"It has a little texture and grip, its a soft plastic and will stay put on counter tops and such without sliding around."
Is this an OEM battery?,I'm not certain. It was either used or of low quality because when it arrived it was leaking! Ended up buying from ETrade supplies instead and I was most pleased with that one
Does this comes with the tools to replace the battery?,"No, it's just the battery and nothing additional."
"Hi, this works with the lg optimus g (e975)?",I'm not sure I got it for my nexus 4
is this oem? and hight quality ?,It looks like a OEM. Actually It is exactly the same battery that my Nexus 4 had. Until now my Nexus 4 is working fine
"Hey, do this also work with the Optimus G ( e973)",Since the Optimus G and the Nexus 4 are the same phone I would think it would work
is the hct one the same as the hct one m7,"As long as you have an HTC ONE (with dual front speakers) and not a model such as HTC ONE X/S/SV etc, the item will be correct."
Product says HTC One M7. Does this case just HTC One silver? Im confused with the M7,Yes this is for HTC One but you may look around the M7 cases. Compare to the jelly style this is heavy.
i am interested in empire red glitz phone case for htc one 2013. it the case full covering around...in pic can see how is top looks like.,"The main image you can zoom in on, the front part of the top is exposed but the back portion towards the top is covered."
can anyone coment about an experience in which this case protection was test to it's limits?,"I try to treat my phone well, but it gets tossed around and dropped and handled with dirty hands...water has been splashed on it, but not submerged or anything. It has been dropped too many times to count. I can tell you that for the money this case is awesome! I have spent more and gotten way less in the past. If I take my case off, my phone looks untouched. And when I wipe the dirt off of the case, it has held up very well also. Ive had the case for 6 months or so now. Great buy in my opinion."
"will it fit a 521, by Nokia?","Do not buy this for a 521. I know that the 521 and 520 look similar, but the back of the 521 is a little bigger and the case does not fit correctly. I mean it will fit if you try to put it on, but you will be able to tell it is not made for the 521. I would recommend purchasing a case made for the 521. The case ""HRWireless T-Stand Impact Kickstand Hybrid Double Layer Fusion Cover Case for Nokia Lumia 521"" is actually a pretty nice case for the 521 if you are looking for something that has protection from drops and such."
can anyone coment about an experience in which this case protection was test to it's limits?,"The rubber gel sleeve covers the back, corners and the edge of the front. The hard plastic cover takes care of the back,top,bottom. the front screen has no protection, so if dropped, and screen takes a hit, it will probably break. Otherwise it should protect well. I have had it fall from my shirt pocket onto concrete,more than once and it survived. No protection for being soaked with water,but would likely take a spill and be ok. Hope I helped."
does this case include a screen cover?,"Yes, it includes one screen protector."
Is it waterproof?,"It is NOT waterproof. It is water-resistant, in that it has a complete rubber surround, and rubber flaps that cover over the USB and headset connections. There are holes in the phone that remain uncovered."
Do you have to remove the case to charge the phone?,Nope. All ports have easy access without removing the case.
Where are the volume keys?,"When you are on a call, use the center circle button (up and down)...."
"Chinese language doesn't come with this phone, but will it support Chinese language if I install Chinese operation system at some cell phone store?",I sincerely don't know the answer to this question............good luck!!!
Can you filter sms?,Affirmative yes no problem
Does this phone supports whatsapp?,"The application exists on the phone under the Main Menu in a ""Chat"" subdirectory. I actually see three items: eBuddy IM, Chat, and WhatsApp. I must admit, however, that I have my internet disabled, and I just use this as an awsome pay-as-you-go ""Voice Phone"" to supplement my work's smartphone. I just wanted something small and easily to slip in my pocket to replace my failing E51 of MANY years. I picked this over the E52 largely because this is a new phone, and that is technology from 3 years ago which I'd have to buy from the Gray Market overseas. For voice calls, it's great. And the ringer gets CRAZY Loud. I do miss wi-fi though... and I'm too cheap to burn my pay-as-you-go minutes for internet. With internet off, and voice only it seems to hold a charge for about 24 days... and I've talked as long as 11 hours on it before the bar got down to 1/3 to 1/4th power. It beats the pants off of the ""Disposable"" TracPhones... and my HTC Sensation/Blackberry/Samsug Galaxy S for voice calls and ring volume. I can hear it from the other side of the house (Though I did set the electronic screeching of Skrillex ""Boomerang"" as my ring tone so it would be extremely audible!) Decent MP3 Player too. Camera is small in MegaPixel but the seamless Panaramic Patch-View mode that stitches together pictures by connecting invisible ""floating boxes"" works really well. Wish my high-end Digital Cameras did that!"
Is this unlock for AT&amp;T or any other carrier in U.S.A like T-Mobile and Sprint?,yes this is
Is the keypad in Numeric with ENGLISH translation or with Arabic translation? i Prefer English,Keypad is in English.
"can i use this in the us, on metro pcs?",The Nokia 301 is a GSM phone and it will NOT work with Metro PCS IF your plan is under a CDMA Network (They now operates under GSM and CDMA networks). Usually GSM carriers provides a SIM card to insert into the phone. The best thing to do is to call Metro PCS and asked them if you buy an unlocked GSM phone you will be able to use it.
Does this phone work in T-Mobile? Has anyone used it on their network?,"I use it on T-Mobile, everything works fine. Internet speeds are just ok, about what you'd expect from a dumb phone."
it work with tmobile,"Yes, this phone will operate with Tmobile."
Does this charge with a standard MicroUSB Port? (IE: Not a proprietary mini charger?),"yes, and from my experience the battery for this phone needs to be charged more often then the ones i have used - i have been a long time Nokia owner. i also only use it as a phone and do not engage any of the other functions. good luck."
is there any holdster recommended to use that can hold this device (whether its a clip for the belt or a sleeve),"The unit 'as-is' does not offer a holster, belt clip or sleeve of any sort (the face of the phone is unprotected with this particular case). Poweradd, Samsung, or a different manufacturer would have to offer this capability separately and would need to intergrate a holster with the existing cover. I did not require this feature since I carry my phone in my purse - all I needed was a protective cover (the extended battery feature was an added bonus for me!) Hope this helps!"
do you know if this will fit the outterbox defender holder?,No it wont
Is this the same product that sells at Best Buy for $ 100?,Yes! Same quality and works exactly the same
Does this product work well for the Verizon model of the Samsung Galaxy S4?? And does it come with a power cord (wall or USB?)? Thanks!,"If using the external battery as a battery and only a battery, it will charge from 0% to a full charge. Just do not count on it protecting the phone in any way. It does not come with a wall charger. But I just plug the case in with my phone still in it and charge my phone from the wall through the charger. After the phone is done charging it will charge the case."
does it work for galaxy S3?,Nope it will only fit the s4
"I have a galaxy S4, but it's not 9500, it's the SGH-1337M. Will this fit my phone?",Yes but the battery life sucks
Will this fit my galaxy S phone?,It should I used in on a s4 for a few weeks. However it's a tricky charger. If you plug it in to charge the external battery it won't charge the phone as well. So you have to charge them separately. It's not a real big deal but it can be frustrating if you're in a hurry to be somewhere and your phones dead. It's a great way to have a backup battery in your bag or something but I wouldn't recommend leaving it on the phone all the time.
"does this happen to work with and S4 Active? As you know, the home keys are different. Thank you","It has nothing to do with any button, only with the power socket, speaker and mic locations and phone size if they are matching the S4 i9505 or S4 i950 then it should work"
I just opened this and it only charges my phone for 15 minutes (about 10% battery power) and then it stops charging and won't turn back on.,Mine is going through the same thing I don't know why
Will this fit for Galaxy S4 Active,"I don't have a GS4 active, but I think the o l difference between the two versions is the water resistant quality of the active. But I am not completely sure"

So you have to charge them separately. It's not a real big deal but it can be frustrating if you're in a hurry to be somewhere and your phones dead. It's a great way to have a backup battery in your bag or something but I wouldn't recommend leaving it on the phone all the time.
"does this happen to work with and S4 Active? As you know, the home keys are different. Thank you","It has nothing to do with any button, only with the power socket, speaker and mic locations and phone size if they are matching the S4 i9505 or S4 i950 then it should work"

I have a new digitizer but need the top outter edge to attach back to the phone.

Once hooked in, there are two (2) screws at the base that secure the digitizerr to the bdy. Challenges that I had with this were: 1.) there is a tiny piece on the earbud jack which is very difficult to get into place. 2.) You have to be really careful with the bales that hold the ribbon cables in place - they break quite easily. Also, be certain to buy the glass with the digitizer attached. I found it nearly impossible to peal the digitizer from the glass with a heat gun. Just buy it as a kit."

No problem!"

Follow the LifeProof Facebook page for more info.
I have a tempered glass screen protector. Will the case snap into place (together)?? or will it be just a notch to thick???,"It will, but prying it apart will not be as easy and putting back together may not as simple. It will begin to crack around the edges."

can you have a case on the iphone 5s while its in the case,"I have a case on MY iPhone 5, and it fits just fine. I think as long as it isn't a HUGE case, then yes, it will fit. My case is a two-part, hard case with silicone shell."
I need to be sure this fits the HM1300 properly before ordering. Pls no time or money to waste.,Yes it did fit my Bluetooth
"Does the black earhook need to be ""adjusted"" with pliers, as pictured?",don't know they all roke so fast I am still looking for decent replacements. Need to return them for another manufacturer
is your product a good fix for the HM 1900 ear hook,"They're fine. Certainly not indestructible, and you have to clamp them down a little bit to fit right. But they work."
Will it fit model 1700?,"it fits, but it fits very loose, causing the Bluetooth to swing down."
"Hi , this product it's easy movie. I mean (my ear large, it easy to wear on the my ears)?",Yes they are big

i have a samsung bluetooth model hm 6000..will these fit at all?,"They did not fit my HM1900 which has a 7.5mm diameter post to connect the earhook to. These earhooks are designed for a 9mm post. The seller suggested I ""tweak them a little"" to get them to work. If you can measure the diameter of the inside of your existing earhook, if it is about 3/8"" then this will work. If it is just under 5/16"" like mine was, then these are too large unless you feel like ""tweaking"" them."
Could you tell me what is the diameter of the semicircle that engages with the headset? thanx,Approximately 1 cm. It works well with my Samsung HM1300.
does this product fit the HM1200?,I have a MH1300 and it fis OK. I can't speak for the HM1200.

"Just received this case; receiving a message that says ""this accessory may not be supported""...case won't charge or turn on :-( Any help?",It does not work with the iPhone 5 I had the same problem I throw mine out in the trash after not getting anywhere with this company
I've searched elsewhere online and found mixed answers - will this case fit an iphone 5c?,No
How can you install the case to prevent screen protector bubbles? It is very visually disturbing.,after you have it on for a while they may go away. If not you could put on a separate screen protector and remove the built in one.. I didn't find it too bad I use both screen protectors a little bubbling in there doesn't bother me
"where can i buy more batteries for iphone 5 , mojo case ? ( what specs I need ? )",On ebay it's the same battery as the samsung galaxy i think its i9300 battery's
Should the screen be as not clear with amor version?,I find the screen clear and touch still works well.

What is the kickstand on the belt clip for? You can't see the screen when it's in the holster.,"It's not on the belt clip piece. It's on the rubberized portion that goe's on the phone.

Does the clip actually swivel so you can have it on your belt in landscape position?,Yes but if you catch it on something like corner of desk the clip separates from the phone
Will this case fit Nokia Lumia 520,Fits perfectly in the Nokia Lumia 521. Ive never seen the 520. See if they're the same size
"how does it work with the belt holster and kick stand? It looks like there is something to go over the screen, where do you put that while using it?",The front faces the inside of the belt holder and the pic of it on here is the back part of the cell
Will this fit the Nokia Lumia 520 AT&amp;T GoPhone?,"Reading through the 1 star reviews for the item, I found the review below. Evidently, the Seller previously had listed the same case as fitting both the Lumia 521 and 520. Another manufacturer, Trident, makes a tough, well made protective case for the 520 in their Aegis line of cases. There's no face cover or belt clip but it's a top quality case that fits and functions on my L520 perfectly. ""DOES NOT PROPERLY FIT THE NOKIA 520, the listing says nokia 520...NOT! SLOPPY FIT, AT LEAST A QUARTER OF AN INCH TOO LONG. BAD BUY, DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY. """
Does the Silicone really have that weird smell mentioned in a 1 star review?,Mine doesn't.

Is a usb port on this phones I even tried on my other s3 i9300 witch I noticed the box that this cable came with said s3i9300 model and still no show tried another TV to see but nothing... What phone you got yours to work with? Seen comments of s4 and s5 working good
do you have to connect it to a power souse and what is a power souse for it?,"My TV has a usb port on on it, so I've been plugging it in there. I haven't tried it in a wall outlet, but I'm thinking it would probably charge it better. As of right now the TV usb doesn't charge it very well and my battery is usually cut by 30 percent when done watching a movie."
"Is using as a hot spot necessary to use Netflix on an S3, or is it not because it is just mirroring the phone screen?","If u using this cable u just have to connect it to ur tv hdmi port and the power source usb and u should be able to see ur phone screen on ur tv, and to tge hot spot as long as u have internet on ur phone u should be able to watch netflix on ur phone and mirror it on to ur tv"
will this work with Samsung tab s?,Yes. I used it with my Samsung tab s 8.4 and it look great.
I have a Verizon SCH-I535 Galaxy S3. will this work for that device? I only ask b/c SCH-I535 wasn't listed under compatible devices..but its for S3!,"I'm not sure, however they have an updated one called: Importer520 (TM) 6.5 feet MHL micro USB to HDMI 1080p HDTV adapter for $7.74 on Amazon.

Hello. Fits to mini s4 i9192?,Yes nice
Clarity please. Do these plastic protectors attach to the phone and then the phone can be placed in a case? I'll be using the Trident case.,yes. you want to put this on first before you put the case on. make sure you have no fan blowing and you use the cloth that comes with it to clean the phone first. then peel a little from #1 up to expose it and attach to the phone. gently peel it off as you move up to remove that #1 layer. it will stick well and keep it from attracting any loose lint/specs flying around. that's the worst problem is keeping the area dust free until you attach it on. hope this helps you.
How thick is it ??,"it is thicker not like a cling cover protected. you def need a case with a front and back it doesn't cling, it has to be snapped in to hold it in place by the case. The sticker label on these also is very difficult to get off, I had to use rubbing alcohol to remove the grime but it is a good protector once you get it all in place and on."
Does the case hold the protector in place since they're non-adhesive?,The protector is slightly adhesive. It comes with peel-off backing. The only possible problem with it might be wherever you touch the sticky side with your fingers. (I had trouble getting a regular phone case and used the protector alone for several weeks with no problem.)
Has anyone ridden a bike while raining with the iBike Console?,I have and phone has stayed completely dry in the rain. Great price for phone holder.
I have an S4 and had an S3 before it. I noticed the rear case picture shows the S3 camera / flash cutout. Is that the actual rear of this case?,I did not notice that photo but the case I got was specifically made for galaxy s4. All my cameras and flash alight perfectly with the cutout
Does it hold the phone with a case on it - or do you have to remove the case first?,You have to remove the case.
How difficult is it to add and remove your phone from the case?,It is very easy to clips on the side hold down the front cover.
can you listen to music with the built in speaker while the phone is in side the case,"Didn't really try that out. I only used plug in headphones and then bluetooth headphones. The case is designed to protect your phone while you are riding, so based on that I do not think that you would be able to use the built in speaker, or the sounds would be muted. However, I just tried it out and it worked. I had to turn the volume up high, but I was able to listen to the built in speaker while in the case. Please note that I could not adjust the volume while it was in the case. But to answer your question, yes, you can listen to music with the built in speaker while the phone is inside the case."
Any chance this would fit an S3? Or would the model for an S3 fit an S4 if one was to upgrade later?,"If the S3 is smaller or the same size as the s4 it would work. I love it, but I have an S4. It fits like a glove!"
How can I connect a charging USB cable while my phone is in this mount? I consider it for long trips on a moto and my bike has a USB port.,"They make an upgraded version that charges while in the cradle. I actually took a dremel to the bottom of mine, which I'm sure is not suggested. I can say that I have riden through some epic rain and mine has remained dry. Once again my solution will probably void any warranty or claim they make about it being wateproof."
It seem to have a screen protector. Does it impair the screen readability during sunny days? It can be critical when using it on a motorcycle.,"The mount does have a touch screen protector. Your phone will sit inside and the mount will close around it. This screen is anti-glare and will not impair your ability to reach the screen on sunny days. Best regards, Jillian Bike2Power Team"
How do you get the ribbed plastic piece through the curved slit? Mine just gets stuck inside. Also the wrench isn't loosening/tightening anything.,The wrench/hex screw is to loosen/tighten the plastic strap. The plastic strap should run parallel to the screw...so the tip of the strap comes out of the housing in the same orientation as uf you are looking at the hex head screw.
Can you charge the phone while it's in this case?,"Yes, the Smart Mount has ports for connecting a charging cable and headphones. You also offer a Power Plus mount that includes a battery and the ability to charger your phone through the mount. You can view the Power Plus model here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FMAIPFK. Best regards, Jillian Bike2Power Team"

"Would it be better to purchase the mega from amazon or walmart, because I purchased a phone through amazon and bought a warranty and was not able to get it fixed once my screen cracked? I just want to be able to protect myself as well as my phone if...",I cannot comment on the warranty. But the ones I bought from Amazon are perfect. FYI I bought two and they are good.

Is this compatible with the iphone 5 or new ipad?,Yes. Both work and charge fast using the power pak.
"At full charge, for how many days it can last without charging it?",Depends on how low your battery is. Mine lasted for 10 days recharging my phone every day. My phone battery was a little under half charged everyday when I charged it. It works better than I expected. Hope this helps.
How many times will it fully charge a S4 &amp; how long it takes to fully charge the phone?,"The battery should be able to charge your phone at least 4 times over before it dies. Although, on average it will probably be able to charge your phone up 5-6 times. As of the charging speed; using the 2.1A output, it will charge it from dead to 100% in around 1-1.5 hrs. If you use the 1A output it will charge it in about 2-3 hours."
"Mine when charged, it only shows three LED lights. Is it normal. This is the second charger doing it.",No

Can I take this on a plane?,Yes... Just travelled to Spain and Italy from Seattle an Philly. No questions asked.
"If anyone is familiar with this and the the 13,500 unit I would appreciate an opinion about the two. Which one performs best ?","Main differences between the NT135T and the NT120R are as follows; the NT135T has slightly more power than the NT120R, but the NT120R is ruggedized which means it is shock proof, water proof and dust proof. I chose the NT120R because of the amount of power you get out of it and that it is more versatile. You can take it anywhere without worrying about damaging it, work, home or play. You will be happy with either, but consider your possible uses and locations."
How long to recharge,When completely dead it is an overnight task.
what are the dimensions?,5.5 x 2.75 x 1.25
"Hi, Would I be able to use already owned cases with this bumper case on my phone or is it too thick?","Do you mean a protective case? If so, no. This goes over the phone only. It does cover the bumper and the back of the phone, so your phone will be protected. unlike other hard cases this case is secured by 2 small screws, so if you were to drop it, it won't go flying apart. On the inside of the case there are strips of i guess insulation to make the fitting nice and snug. hope that helps. or take a look at this one. helped with the reception. http://amzn.com/B00DS1CT9S"
Will this case work with Verizon Galaxy s4?,It does work with the Verizon Galaxy S4. I don't know if it was my phone but it seemed to cause some reception problems. It is a pretty nice case though.

"I would like to know before I purchase, will this fit on Samsung Galaxy S3 SGH-T999?","I have the same phone and I also have the lens and it works just fine for my purposes,I am quite happy with the whole set-up."
Will this fit on the Samsung Galaxy S III Mini?,"If the Mini is at all a different size, then this won't work as the case is form-fitting and is necessary to screw the lenses onto the camera lens. I imagine it must be sized differently, since it is a ""mini""."
does the case fit an iPhone 5?,Only if there is a model specific to that phone. The kit works by attaching a case to the phone and you must get the model specific to your phone.
"will this work with the GS4,5,6?",No. The case is designed specifically for the SGS3.
can you put a bumper or another case on this case to protect the sides of it,No you can't

Has anyone used this kit in regards to higher quality video recording?? How does the focus handle??,"For the telephoto lens, not as well as it could be, even for just pictures. The telephoto is not an autofocus it is manual. It does take good pictures and the zoom is impressive when the focus is right. I do recomend using the tripod with it. Having said that, it is still worth the money. I have had this set for about 6 months now and have a lot of fun with it. The other lens work very well. The fisheye lens is a true fisheye. The macro could be a little better for my taste but still works well. Its a fun set of lenses. Quality is pretty good too."
"I have an SIII, but planning to upgrade to SIV will these fit both phones, or just the SIII?",The case is what makes them attach to the phone and it is specific to the SIII
Are there any other lens available other than the 3 that shipped?,"Hi just Sayin, We don't have any other lenses aside from these three lenses; telephoto, fisheye, macro and wide angle lenses. Hope that helps. Kind Regards, Angie/ECO-FUSED"

"Ok, you don't have a picture of the back of the case, but can you describe it and tell us what the material is on the back and what holes are there?","It's sort of like a leather sticker you stick on the back. I really love the case and get compliments on it all the time. It is a little more comlicated than I had expected to ""install,"" I actually had to read the directions!"
is this the entire phone case or just the backing...?,"Aluminum and wood peace wraps around the edge of the phone, and it has the option of a black or brown sticker that covers the back of your iPhone"
Is this for the new iPhone 5s ?,Yes it will fit I have 5 and 5s is same
does it comes with a case,Leather case
"You mention that you have the silver and black options, but do you have the grey/gun metal option?",Sorry to tell you that we did not have such option. Hope you know that.

It says it is compatible with Samsung Galaxy S4 i9500; is it also compatible with Samsung Galaxy S4 SGH-M919?,"All S4 models are the same. The ""model"" number just indicates whether it's a Sprint, Verizon, international, etc. If it works on one it'll work on another. My S4 is the SPH-L720 and it works no problem."
the lens blockout the flashlight?,"Yes, it does for me also, I don't know what to say to correct it, I just don't use it very much so I bought it mostly for the holder of the camera so good luck on it"
"How many lenses come with this product? I was under the assumption that there was supposed to be 4 lenses, but only received 3.",The macro breaks off into 2 lenses but it wont work unless theyre together
wish there were better directions...do you have to take the back off the phone to put on the lens holder?,"Hi, no need to take the back of the phone. This looks like a case that attaches to the back of the phone and the thread for the lens is embedded in that. it's something you can keep on the phone at all times if you wish, it offers some protection too. hope this helps."
Will this work with the mini,"No, the case that holds the lens is made to fit a regular size S4."
Regarding the fisheye lens... is it an approximation like the one I have in my regular camera or does it give me a 360 view? Thanks,"A fisheye lens will never give a ""360"" view, but it does work just like any fisheye lens by giving you a nice 180 view."
Will this work with the Samsung Mega?,I guess not. You have to replace the back cover of the S4 in order to attach the lenses.
Will this work with any regular size tripod?,"Hi MomOfTwins, You can swap the included tripod with any regular tripod that you have. The Universal Phone Holder Attachment has a standard tripod socket so it will work with any tripod. Hope that helps. Kind Regards, Angie/ECO-FUSED"
"In case the case does get damaged, can a case be purchased seperately, or would you be stuck buying the whole package again?",gotta buy the whole package again
Can the wide angle lens be attached the end of the zoom lens?,No none of the other lens can be attached to the zoom lens
How much of a difference does the tape really make vs glue? After cracking my glass I've been keeping it in an OtterBox Defender.,We did not use the tape nor did we have a need to. The glass is already sticky so when u get the broken glass off u can just peel the film from replacement glass and it should stick just fine. Mine did. U will needed to rub the glass to make sure the replacement glass sticks and lays fine though. U tube has some good vidoes regarding screen rrplacement. Good luck!
Will this fit the Samsung Galaxy S4-SCH-I337?,"Hi Tanya, this should definitely fit your Samsung Galaxy S4-SCH 1337 since they both have the same display features 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.0 inches with Samsung Galaxy S4 i9500."
Will this work for US Cellular GS4 and do you have a video you recommend to follow to install the screen?,"I dunno about is working for US Cellular, but here are two videos that I found helpful: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_BadHtLPbU and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byrasHe5BUM - I would highly recommend putting tape over the glass. Mine kept breaking and splintering as I removed it. Didn't hurt the phone, but almost got glass in my eye until I put tape over the glass like in the second video."
Does this replacement comes in white color ? I need it in white,"Hi Scarlett, Yes, we do have the white color. For the replacement kit in white please go to this link: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DUR2H2E Regards, Angie/ECO-FUSED"
how do i know if i need this or the actual digitizer also (without taking the phone apart of course),"If the phone is still operational, whereas the touch functions still work and a good picture, then it's just the glass you need. If the touch function isn't responsive, its the digitizer. If there is no picture, obvious crack in the picture, or color bleeding in the picture itself, then it is the LCD."
"Is there just the tape, or is there clear liquid adhesive as well?","Just the tape. If done right, its very clean."
Is this also applicable for model Galaxy S4 I9505?,"Yes, the screens are identical."
Is the color of the screen replacement black mist or just plain black?,I believe it was the mist black. It had little dots all over it.

I bought this product recently but mine didn't come with a manual. Can I get the link to the tutorial video?,"Hi Jill, I'm sorry to know that your screen replacement kit didn't come with a manual. It could be a packaging error. What a bummer! I apologize for the inconvenience. For the video tutorial link. You can go to YouTube and search for ""ECO-FUSED SCREEN REPLACEMENT"". It will show up on top right away. If you have further questions, feel free to contact me through the link below at any time as I am always here to help."
Will this fit my Samsung Galaxy s4 SGH-I337?,Yes it will
Is this gorilla glass 3,No its not gorilla glass....but it works great
will this screen also fit a s4 active? (model # SGH-I537),"Im sorry I really couldnt tell you but I guess if you can get a chance to physchally look at them both and they look identical then I would not see why it wouldnt cause it is just the glass anyway. I tried to do it my self but I screwed my phone up pretty bad I had to pay 200 to get it fixed when in the begining I could have paid 100. So a bit of advice when you do it really take your time to heat it up good, cause when you do it should peel off very very easy and you should probably use the very fine wire it comes with. The guitar picks can break the lcd screen. Yeah I f_cked that one up. LOL"
"Does the kit have the frame around the glass, if not, do you have the frame for sale ?","Hi Ali, This kit does not include the frame around the glass of the Samsung Galaxy S4 and we do not sell the frame either. Hope that helps. Kind Regards, Angie/ECO-FUSED"
I shattered the front and theres no picture but the phone is still ringing....will this screen replacement be helpful?,"I don't believe it will. The glass cover protects the digitizer (touch screen functions) and the LCD that displays the visuals. If your LCD is not showing anything then your core problem is deeper in the phone. Your video section is bad for some reason, probably a power disconnect to the LCD or backlight."
Does this fit Samsung Sgh-I537 ?,"Hi Kevin, This screen replacement kit will not work on a Samsung SGH-I537 since they have different dimensions. Unfortunately, we do not have any screen replacement kit that will fit on your phone. Hope that helps. Kind Regards, Angie/ECO-FUSED"

I've used four (4) of these Jabra SPORT replacement that we're replaced under warranty. After the fourth Jabra replacement, we quit calling for replacement. All four Jabra had a batteries.

"people say they do not last long, have solved anything?","Are you talking about battery life or the actual device? Battery life is ok, just ok. Once it says battery low, it will be dead in 5 minutes. As far as device quality, all Jabra devices have horrible lives. They just aren't built to last."

Does it charge your galaxy devices relatively quickly like the original?,"The cables I received could not. The Galaxy phones check that the metal portion of the micro-b plug body is conductive to the internal ground (meant to be through cable shielding, and these cables are not shielded), which is generally true only on higher quality cables. These cables do not have that conductivity, and so the phone will limit charging amperage to something less than 800 mA."

Is this cord going to work with the Galaxy S6?,"Most likely not, it depends on the port. Is it similar to the Galaxy S5?"

I bought it for a Galaxy SII, and it is the exact same battery as the one my device was bought with."
Do you ship to south africa?,No
Will this work with a gaming console such as a ps4 or xbox one?,Although I have no knowledge of those boxes I do know if they have micro usb audio output or bluetooth audio then it should work. If no micro usb audio out then perhaps an adaptor to go from phone jack to that? You'd have to check with a place like RadioShack to help you for such things. Also there's such a thing as phone jack to bluetooth transmitters. Hope that helps.

does it come with a charger,Yes...
I have a Sony non Bluetooth CD player and I was going to order a Bluetooth transmitter for it. Will these headphones pickup from that transmitter?,Yes they Will connect to any other blues tooth device
Can you wear it in the rain?,I have worn mine in the rainrain with no ill affect
All I really want to know (after buying this of course) is if you can listen to the radio as well as downloading your own music. Please advise!!,"According to your radio device, if radio FM signal is good, then the sound will be very good."
"So, can you listen to music you've downloaded but can you just listen to a radio station?","Musicjogger just can listen to music with bleutooth device, not included with TF/Micro card, and sorry that aslo can not listen to radio station itself unless by your mobile phone"

does this case fit the mauve music cricket phone.,"I don't know, we use it on the Samsung Galaxy S4."
is this the original one or fake??,Original one
"how do you get the S4 to show info in the top window? what if i wanted to answer the phone through that window, for example.",You just press the power button and it will only show the info in the top window and the rest of the screen remains black. Whenever the lid is on the screen it will only activate the top window whatever you do. And when you remove the lid it will automatically activate the whole screen.
will this case fit the samsung galaxy S3 phone?,I believe the S3 is a bit smaller than the S4. I would recommend only buying accessories if they're marked for your specific model.
"Is the ""red"" case bright red - or the purple seen here?",I bought black
Even tho this has 5 ports if I have 2 iPads and an iPhone (3 devices) i have maxed its use at 5.2A?,"Correct... I haven't tested to see which port(s) would be 'ramped down', but the effect would be that one or more devices would charge a bit more slowly. Chances are good they will all charge, and pretty fast (you're only ""missing"" 200mA), but it won't be all three devices at full speed."
"Why does the four port cost more than the five port, shouldn't be the other way around?","Both the white and black color version of this charger have 5 ports. The black color charger costs more because it uses ""smart ports"" where each of the 5 ports can provide a charge at any device's maximum capability (for example, it can charge 5 iPads at once at full speed). On the white color charger, only certain ports will charge certain devices at full speed (for example, only 2 of the ports can charge the iPad at full speed)."
does this product support ipad mini?,"Yes it does, you can use the iPad port. It works great and if you're at the airport, you'll make lots of friends :). Just make sure they're only plugging in their phones."
Is the AC power consumed 0.00 watts when no USB devices are plugged in?,My Kill-A-Watt shows 0.0 watts with the charger plugged in and nothing plugged into the USB ports.
Is it UL listed?,"I don't think so, there is not a UL symbol on the device. If I could post an image here, I have a scan of the bottom plate of the device. It shows a C, a curved Capital E, a diamond with PS over E in it, a FC with a small 'c' in the capital C, an oval with CCC with 3 small letters in the last C that I can't read, a circle with curved ETL, a Square within a square, a symbol for a house, a recycle icon and a do not put in trash icon. There is some very tiny text that I cannot read at all. The instruction manual does not have any mention of the UL rating. In regard to my earlier comment, the Anker customer service has now contacted me and I'm waiting for another response."
Is it compatible with 240V outlets? I am traveling out of the USA and the country I am visiting has 240v current.,"Hi Cyrus. Yes, it is 120-240 volts so it is electrically compatible all over the world. To be physically compatible, either carry a universal AC adapter (best) or you can change the power cord to have a local plug. The power cord is a fairly common twin-wire appliance cord. Another option, for Germany, France, Spain, and some others is to purchase the item on amazon.de. You'll get a compatible cord. Cost is similar to"
Would like to put in a multi device charging station/cord organizer. Lying sideways will it fit in confined space &amp; stay cool (in lieu of power strip),I have never noticed it getting hot. I am not sure about confined spaces. I do like the quality and feel and convenience of a multiple usb port charger with a separate cord allowing charging in more convenient locations.
can I charge my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1?,"Yes. I also had one that I use regularly...this is one of the devices that takes more energy to charge...which is one of the main reasons I bough this 5 port device. It will easily charge my Galaxy Note 10.1 (before it died last month...booohooo) my phone, my husband's phone, my I pod and his Kindle Fire when needed. All as fast as if they were plugged in separately. This actually reproduces more amps than most..they usually split the power - which takes forever to charge the Note 10.1."
"Does this charge Nokia Windows 8 phones, 920, 928, 929, 1020, 1520?","I don't know about that phone specifically, but I would imagine so. It charges my HTC One, my iPad and Kindle HD and all my other devices."
Will this charge the Anker E5.?,"Yes it will. If you plug it into the ""Android"" port, you're getting ~the same current that your USB port on your computer provides. You can charge most any modern device (made since implementation of USB 2.0) through any of the ports. Plugging into one of the ""iPad"" ports may shorten your charging time significantly; it depends on how the E5 negotiates the charge current it draws. But, long story short, you should be able to plug just about any modern device into any of the ports on this charger and charge it as fast or faster than through your computer's USB port. I recommend using the ""iPad"" port to ensure that your device draws the maximum current it will accept to minimize charge time. Hope that helps!"
Which one to i buy for iphone 5? :(,"Depending on your iPhone original carrier (AT&T, T-Mobile). This SIM card is for your iPhone T-mobile only and make sure T-Mobile coverage in the area you'd like to activate."

will the iPhone 5 work with this type of sim card because i don't know what type of network it is. all i know that its from united kingdom,I wouldn't recommend it. You service will be very bad from areas that you shouldn't have a problem getting service from. I had to do away with that straight talk Sim and I no longer have any problems. I hear that it's so screwed up because it doesn't know which tower to use. I wouldn't recommend this route.
i have a blu life 8 and ned a at&amp;t sim card for staight talk,This SIM card worked for 2weejs then went out. I was with out a phone for days

Does this work with the iPad Air?,It works but unsure for the iPad air.

can i use this only for activation my iphone5s,I believe so.
Does the phone case protect better than the otter box? and does it mess with the signal??,"I'm very happy with the protection , but I have to be honest it more than doubles the weight of the phone and being able to listen sounds like people are under water I don't expect much on quality of speaker but I couldn't even understand people."

MINI JAMBOX Speaker 24"" (0.61m) Micro-USB charging cable 36"" (0.91m) 3.5mm stereo cable Quick Start Guide So you get a USB cable for plugging the speaker into an AC/DC adapter but no adapter. So, you can use an existing one for like an IPHONE or Android phone or plug it into a USB port on a laptop/desktop and you should be able to charge from there. The battery is built in and included. A case is not included unless someone is bundling it or it's a special edition your looking at."

Does this speaker hold up well to sand from the beach?,No electronic equipment holds up well to sand. Sand can get in the USB and sound jack. I think it can also find its way through the speaker cover. I treat it like a phone...no water and no sand.
Can this speaker be paired with multiple devices at once? Or does it need to be re-paired every time you switch between your phone and your tablet?,"I have paired my Mini Jambox with my phone and laptop at the same time. Obviously, you can only use the speaker with one device at a time. When you switch between the two you must turn off one and press the pairing button on the Jambox to activate the other."
can I use my ipod with jambox?,Absolutely.
what is the difference between jamboxes,The mini jambox is the size of a large cell phone and is good for inside. Good for casual listening. The Jambox is the size of an 8-pack box of soda and pumps out alot of volume. Great for poolside or parties.

"I want to have music around th house, room to room with one of these speakers. But I have a desktop PC. Do I need a tablet or Ipad to use speaker?",You can use it with your desktop as long as it has bluetooth capability.

I have an older intercom system that I play music my phone/Ipod through the aux . I want to add wireless speaker(s) outside.Will the signal reach?,"Hello Andrea. If your intercom system has a bluetooth transmitter, the ""usual"" operational range is 15 feet. I've heard of of other posts claiming 30 feet, but that's pushing it.

how to install?,It works on Bluetooth
HOW DO YOU PAIR IT?,"Carole, First step is to make sure Bluetooth is turned on on your mobile device. Power up the Jambox, set it close to the device and push the button below the power button.

can you sync it with multiple devices?,Yes. Very easy.
DOES IT WORK WITH mp3 player? Is sound loud enough to put on motorcycle?,"It does have an audio input from a headphone jack so that would function.

I have noticed a few iPhone users complaining about lower than desired volume, but on my Samsung Galaxy S4 the volume is very loud for such a small device. Hope that helps."
"When I have the speaker connected to my laptop with bluetooth the sound is fuzzy, is there something wrong with the speaker?","Try To Connect It To Another Device If Its Fuzzy It Most likely Bad, You Can Try To Connect Using The Cord Too. I Heard Some Were Bad Sounding."

Does it fit or do you have one for Galaxy S4 Active,"Sherry, This case well deffintly fit the active but I have never seen someone buy the otter box defender series for the active because it is already protected from damage.

"How long does it hold charge when not in use? Box says 7 days, instructions says 3-4 weeks. Which one is more accurate?",I think 3-4 wks is more accurate. I feel a lot safer having it.

I really like having this unit but today I was alarmed. While charging my phone in my purse it got really hot. What's up with that? Can't be healthy.,Im not sure if its healthy or not but its happening because electricity is being transferred and with it being in an enclosed space (your purse) the heat from it charging your phone has no were to go so it continues to build hotter and hotter. If I charge my phone while it's in my purse I normally have the battery inside my purse and the phone in and outside pocket. That seems to work really well for me. :)

What is the wrist band and how is it used? How does the kick stand feature work? How do you carry the touch pen with this case?,"The wrist band is just one of those rubber 'bracelets' and really has nothing to do with it. I am guessing that it's advertising and we just pitched it. The kick stand works great - you just pull it out and then it holds the phone up on your desk (or whatever surface you have it sitting on). And the touch pen really doesn't 'fit' anywhere on the case. It's just a separate stylus that you can use with your phone. But it does work great and is nice to have if you do use them. This was ordered for my boss and he doesn't use the 'touch pen', but I keep it at my desk for when I have to do stuff on his phone for him. I hope this helps!"
Will this work with the new OtterBox Prefix Series Case for Samsung Galaxy S III?,"I wish I could tell you this, but I don't know.

will this belt clip fit a samsung s3 with a thin aluminum case on it?,I don't think so. I have the otterbox commuter case and the clip is not spring loaded. Its molded so it probably won't hold the slim aluminum case securely
When receiving calls do you have to take it out of the case?,"No, you don't need to. You can set up your phone so the home key answers the phone and the power button ends calls. And you can talk with the flap closed. Or if you don't have it set up that way you just simply pull the flap back as you talk."
"Hi, I would like to know if my Samsung Express (measurements 5 3/16"" x 2 &frac34;"" x 3/8"") will fit in this case, without being loose. We have already tried 2 other cases that were supposed to fit my cell, but they were almost a 1/4"" bigger. Thanks","Hey ari, my samsung express fits nice and snug, im not sure about the dimensions and dont have a measuring tape on hand. But the model number is ""Samsung-SGH-I437"" On an unrelated note the ""leather"" is faux leather and has started to crack and bubble. I am satisfied with the case for what Iit costs, but wouldn't re buy."
Does anyone know if the Samsung Galaxy Express in an Otterbox Defender case would fit in this? I don't want to take my new phone out of the Otterbox. Looking for a case with a cover that I can put the whole thing into for times when I want extra...,"I can tell you that the ultra slim case fits the phone perfectly as the phone locks in place once it is put in the case. That said, I don't believe it will fit with the otter box case applied to it. Hope this helps."

"There are 2 sticker tabs on the screen protector, these tabs would not peel off the screen protector cleanly. What a mess! Is this normal?",I had the same issue at first. Then I realized the sticker tabs are only on the two protector tabs. The actual screen protector is in between.

"I bought this 2 days ago and ruined all 3 front ones by putting them on getting bubbles and repeating, how can i replace them??",Email them
why front shield cover the little hole for microphone,"That part is pre-cut, all you need to do is to removed it and you should be ready to go."
Will this fit the iPhone 5c?,"The 5c has the same screen size as the 5 and 5s so yes, it will fit any of those devices. It's a good product just so long as you properly clean your screen before applying. So many people are terrible at applying screen protectors and in turn give the product a bad review when in actuality it's the person that's defective, not the product. Best advice I've gotten when applying screen protectors is to use a piece of duct tape and dab it across the screen to grab up any minor dust particles immediately before applying the screen protector."
"Hi, i would like to know if these screen protectors were made specifically for iPhone 5 or 5s",It's for both the 5 and 5s. It has a large enough opening for the flash that it does not hinder the use.

I'm not sure for the warranty, because the phone is a gift from a friend, I think is still under warranty but I don't know for how long.

Does it show notifications with the iPhone 5S emails SMS ect.,nope mine was extremely bad all i could get it to do was answer a voice call. mine i could set the time and alarm . but unfortunately it would not tell time. it was like being in the twilight zone where time stood still. it was a total waist of time & money.
What is its memory size? Can it play MP3 music from its memory without a sim card?,I'm not sure what size the memory is and I don't see any ports on the thing. DON'T buy it. It sucks big time. Lousy design and operation. Any time you move your wrist you trigger buttons that are on the wrong spot on the thing.
is it worth the 45$???,"yes it was,it does not have all the options of other watches, but for the money, it was well worth it."
"Hello, does it work with blackberry too? or just with android an iOS?",I don't know.... But watch is not worth price and is plastic junk. It stopped working and while it was speaker was junk I couldn't hear caller andccaller couldn't hear me

Does it work for note 4? Thanks.,Maybe only if it's listed with the product the magnifier its self screws on to the case that comes with it...well that was the case with my s4
does it include the vinyl (or plastic) case?,"It does but I can say I was a little disappointed after it showed up. The magnifier screws onto the case, but the camera hole to the case is smaller than the camera lense which makes for a circle picture. It looks like the pic is being taken from a tube. But, once you figure out the focus on it, whatever is inside that circle looks super magnified with good clarity. The lights on it are strong too. I'd rate it 3 out of 5"
IT CAME whit the back case to put the camera?,"Yes, it comes with a back case to attach the camera to. Works great!"
Will this work on the Galaxy S4 Mini?,"No, it won't fit. It's mounted to a shell that snaps onto the back of the phone, so it wouldn't fit on a mini."
does this fit the s4 sgh m919,yes it does
is this product good for videos and pictures at stadium concerts?,"Hi Maria F., i'm sorry but i bought that as a gift for my father and i haven't received a feedback, i think it's probably because he hasn't used it! I would recomend you to ask another user who has bought the item and used it already! Again, sorry i can't be more of any more assistance! Good luck!!"
will this fit on the sprint version of the s4?,Yes it should. I myself do not like the magnifier you have to place it right on top of things
Anyone try to put this on a Galazy S4 Active (waterproof model)?,Cheap products it's still in the package but for twenty bucks hey I have the s4
This case will also serve the huawei ascend Y300?,Yes!

Do you combine shipping charges if I bought a phone case and a watch?,Sorry to tell you that we don't offer combine shipping. You need pay each item's shipping fee.
Is the front of the case raised on the sides?,A little but not really the case doesn't have much support but it is cute
Are the sides clear?,no the sides are blackish...it is cheap not worth it! It looks like someone made the design from a printer then stuck it to some plastic.
Is the design blurry?,Yeah it is pretty blurry.
Can anyone verify the output at 1.5 amps? All I have seen are 1 amp and my Nexus 7 uses 1.8 so this would be much faster than the 1 amp versions.,To properly charge the Nexus 7 alignment is the key issue it does charge my Nexus 5 almost as fast as a USB cable
Does this work with a plastic case on phone?,Depends on the thickness of the case. I use it with a Poetic bumper on my Nexus 4. I also use it with a TPU case on my Nexus 7 (2013). No issues with either despite the device not physically touching the charge pad.
"HELLO, WORKING WITH A HTC ONE M7?","Unsure. I have a Samsung Galaxy S4 but a word of warning: I ordered two and one of them no longer works properly. Now when I lay my phone on top, it charges for a second, then stops charging and re-starts immediately, over and over again. Each time it emits a beep. Not usable. The other one is still working fine."
"Can I use charging pad to charge multiple devices at same time, for example, my nexus and my moto 360","No. The sweet spot is only big enough for one device. I do like this charger, though"
Can this charger charge two phones at the same time?,I haven't tried but I would guess no.
can it charge HTC one MAX?,Sadly it doesn't look like that phone uses QI built into the battery charger...sooo you'll need to add it....and as you can not remove the back cover you'll need to use something silly like thishttp://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00H92C2US/ref=mp_s_a_1_sc_3?qid=1404534420&sr=8-3-spell&pi=AC_SX110_SY165_QL70. I don't think it's worth sticking something that ugly to the back of your phone....keep the wire ;-).
what are the demensions of the pad,its about the size of the phone but it doesnt work for my phone - nexus 4
Will this charge a a motorola droid max with holster on?,Yes it does. I am assuming you are referring to the shell and holster set. It will charge the phone even if it is in the holster as long as the back of the phone can set on the device it will charge.
"I have a nexus 4 - will this charger charge to 100%, turn off, then turn on again if battery discharges? i.e. keep battery about 100%?",Yes. It does for my droid MAXX.
What are the pad dimensions? (I guess what's shown on the product description is the size of the packaging),3 1/8 inches wide by 5 15/16 inches long.
I cannot unscrew the tip to put on a replacement. What am I doing wrong?,"I think you may have purchased the amPen that is not replaceable. If you purchased it on Amazon, only the pink hybrid stylus has the removable tip."
What size is the tip?,I am not sure if this is a great answer but it is the size of the eraser at the back of a pencil. The writing line is smaller though and not as thick as it might look. I hope that helps.
Will these tips fit the iFrogz stylus pen?,"I doubt it. The am pen New Hybrid Stylus is the one that takes the screw-in refills. It's approximately 1/2"" in diameter and 47/8"" long. The Capacitive Stylus is 3/8""in diameter and 44/8"" long. Although that's irrelevant to your question I was asked that a while ago so it's available to anyone who reads the reviews. You may have to buy the Hybrid if you want the convenience of refills."
"How long is a tip supposed to last? Mine appears to be in good condition, but no longer works on my iPhone 5. Have had to go back to the old rubber-tip type. I will be happy to buy the replacement tips when I know how many ""miles"" each should last. Are...",I have a iPhone 4 and IPAD 3 and have not had a problem with this stylus. I just replaced the tip after three months of using as I only use a stylus. The only thing I found with the rubber tip ones is that it made a black streak on my screen which comes off with the ZAGG foam cleaner. I sure like this stylus as so nice and smooth and I bought 10 pacs of the tips. If you want a good rubber tip that has replacement tips the Wacom was my other one that I use. I hope this helped.
What is the extra spring for?,It's to attach to the pen itself to lengthen the cord that goes in the headphone jack for portability
"Why is everyone buying the 7 mm size, as opposed to the smaller 6 mm stylus refills? Seems like smaller is better when working on a small tablet...",I like the bigger one as it fits my hand better. Didn't like the small one. Felt like there was nothing in my hand.
Wll these tips fit the TruGlide Stylus with microfiber tip?,"The ad says: Compatible with all amPen New Hybrid Styli (Black, Silver and Pink). I would buy tips which are compatible with TruGlide."
What happened to the slim tips?,"Good question, I just bought a pack last month! I emailed the company to see what's up. From Techmatte: ""Sorry for that. It is out of stock right now. It is expected to be restocked on Jan 6. Sorry for any inconvenience. Best TechMatte Support"""
I HAVE 5 OF THE amPen Ultra-sensitive Capacitive Stylus' How do I screw the tips on.,"Make sure you have the ampen with the remove able tip, I have a older one that the tip is not removable and they look the same. If so follow what Tom Buchanan posted before me."
"Do these fit the Wisdompro stylus, it says they are often purchased together?","Sorry, but I don't know. I use the amPen stylus."
Can a cover be used on Nokia Lumia 1020 with camera grip attached? Is there a case to fit over hump to give better protection from falls??,"I do not know of a cover for the camera grip attachment. The camera grip attachment, in addition to adding a second battery and the convenience of a tripod mount, is also a protective shell for the phone. It would be rather redundant and bulky to add yet another protective element to the Nokia 1020. The device comes with a lanyard which when used provides assurance from dropping the phone."
does it have a hole to attach to a standard tripod,"Yes it does. It's not centered under the lens like you might expect, but you can mount it no problem to any standard tripod."
"Does it have a ""hole"" somewhere on this case to where you can tie a lanyard to it? Or any type of strap or tie?","Yes. It has a slit in the case, on the front, so that the lanyard you have on the phone can still function."
Why is the black one so much more expensive than white and yellow?,Go on Microsoft website. They were same

"First of all, does this look exactly as it does in the picture (colors and print on belly)? Second of all, does it really fit the iPhone 5/5s?",Yes this item is exactly as it appears! Purchased it for my teenage daughter and she was completely satisfied!

Will this work with a Samsung Galaxy Light phone?,I Don't know.
Does it work good?,Very good my husband uses the car adapter and charges good speed. The 3ft is shorter then factory id recommended the longer cord.
Can it work with a samsung galaxy s2?,O yes I am sure. Just so you know it takes a long time to charge my phone. Its cute but after having for awhile not very fast.
Will this work with an LG MS770 MetroPCS smartphone?,I'm not sure II and now samsung 4?? Sorry
what can u do when the battery charger is not charging?,You may need a new charger. have them check it in the store. We got a dud one time.
how do you know when the battery is fully charged?,"When you first connect the battery the light turns red to show its connected properly. Then when you plug into the wall it flashes blue. When it is done charging it turns solid blue. It takes a long time, but worth it if you charge them ahead of time and take the batteries with you. I charge them overnight. Hope that helps."
"The charger has 2 movable contacts, the battery has 3 contacts, how do we set the chargers movable contacts for the EB484659VA?","If you look closely, one of the contacts is probably marked + and another - If not, you'll have to try all the combinations; the charger's green light comes on when you get the connections right, even if it isn't plugged in."
does this work with the galaxy s3 battery?,Yes
Will iPhone 4S in ballistic case fit this? Or will the ballistic case have to be removed first ?,Removed 1st

can you still plug in the charge cable without removing it from the case,Yes

Is this armband sturdy? I don't want my phone rockin' and rollin' when I do cardio.,"It doesn't move.. you can work out, run, snow blow, etc.... Arm band is wide, which really helps..."
does it allow us to access on leftside buttuns?,Yes absolutely does. The case is soft rubber. All buttons are accessible.
Will it fit an IPhone 4 in a Lifeproof case?,No it's snug. U have to take it out of your caee
"How to attach strap? Just put inside silicone 1 end&amp; out other end? Silicone doesn't fit tightly, iphone could phone fall out???",The strap is already attached to the silicone case. You just slip it on your arm and use the velcro to tighten it to your liking. I had an iphone 4s that fit snug in the case; I wasn't worried it would fall out. The case is a harder structure than I had thought which was a pleasant surprise. Hope that helps!
I would like to know how good the velcro is? Does it last? How long? Does it have a strong grip or the armband slides down the arm?,The Velcro is fantastic. The armband is easily adjusted and stays in place pretty well. This is the best of 4 armbands I have owned.
Do I have to take my Otterbox case off of my phone in order that it will fit inside this armband?,"Hi Tak, I havent tried it with the case since I didnt have one in the first place. The arm band is a precise fit for the phone. So it seem like it would not fit. You would have to remove the case."
Will this fit the Droid Maxx?,It fits but controls do not match I cut an extra hole..... But hard to control the music I am playing and volume
Does this fit the Droid RAZR HD?,yes
Can I wear this on my wrist as opposed to my upper arm?,The strap is adjustable with velcro so you could wear it on your wrist
Can you fit a photo ID or credit card behind the phone(inside the case)? Thanks.,"Hello Mike, Yes you can fit about 2 credit card style objects behind the phone. Thanks, Mediabridge Customer Support 856-216-8222 support@Mediabridgeproducts.com"
Does this fit the regular Droid Razr (non maxx)?,I don't know. I don't have one. I have an IPOD Nano and don't use it for my phone or anything else. It is the size of an IPOD nano if that helps.

Does this phone work with a normal sim card? Thanks,Yes it does

Hi! Which color is this cellphone?,Urban grey
"Hi, will it work in Brazil? I&acute;m almost buying this one :)","I have no idea, but it works here perfectly in the UK. Check your mobile providers network bands for GSM/EDGE/3G/HSPA/HSPDA+ and see if they match up with the specs for this international model. If they do you should be fine"
Hi goodnight. Will it work in Trinidad and does it have a SIM card slot?,"YES, it will work in Trinidad as long as the network is GSM and it has SIM card slot. very lovely phone."

Do I need to purchase this to get the QI charging pad to work?,Yes
"Does the receiver module actually ""stick"" to the battery? Will I be able to use it if I switch between two batteries?","It does stick. And in my experience, can be finicky about where exactly it's sitting. You could certainly try to not peel the tape and just use it, but not sure how successful you might be."
with this charge through a leather case ?,"It charges my phone through my otter box case, so it should work through you leather one."
Is this device magnetic? Will it allow the phone to stick to a magnetic mount?,No this is not magnetic. It has its own tape backing to adhere it to your battery. Nothing else.
does this fit the samsung galaxy 3 mini?,Not for sure about the mini...
Has anyone had issues with losing their wireless internet connection once this is installed (going from full to 0-1 bars)?,That never happened to me...
Just got in the mail today and it is charging. Instructions say to enter password on keyboard in order to connect it to bluetooth. None there. ???,connect it to Blutooth first and then it will automatically give you the password

Will this work on the 1st generation kindle fire had?,Yes this will work . The cases changed with the kindle fire hd they made them slimmer andwith cameras in some so the cases won't inter change. We bought the curve cover too especially for the grandkids and they aren't worth looking at!!!! They wont even keep the unit inside!!! Hope this helps.
How do I know if I have a 2nd or 3rd generation,"Look on the back of your device! If it says ""kindle"" it will be the first generation. The second and third says ""Amazon"" I have the first generation."
Is there an opening in the case for charger?,"There is, it's covered by a removable piece of rubber to keep it splash proof."
"Is the kindle ""sandwiched"" in between protective pieces so that the screen is covered by a sturdier firm plastic cover??",Yes it is
"My kindle is the Kindle Fire HD 7"", not sure what generation, it is 7.6"" x 5.4"", will it fit??","Please read below. Here is where I purchased from: Sold by: Phone Accessories Mall PLEASE NOTE: The case is only fit Kindle Fire HD 7"" Previous Generation (2012 ). It will not fit NEW Kindle HD 7(2013)or HDX 7(2013) Friendly Reminder&#65306; There are two layers of protective film on on each side of the screen protector. In order to avoid misunderstanding, we have removed some of protective film on the back.If the front has obvious lines across,please peel off the protective film on each side of screen protector.Thanks! The travellor Kindle Fire HD 7"" case combines durable protection with a lightweight design. Constructed from a special foam that provides shock absorption and impact resistance, the travellor child-proofs your device from the kid in all of us. I hope this helps"
"Can you verify the port holes for charging the kindle are on the opposite side of the camera? Wanting to make sure the case will line up properly on Kindle Fire HD 7"" I have","If you bought your kindle fire HD after October 2013 and did not buy the previous generation then this case will not fit. The newest kindle fire HD has the charger port on the opposite side from a speaker. It is very streamlined with a micro usb port, a power button, a speaker port and a plus and a minus button. That is it. This case is made for Kindle Fire HD's produced prior to October 2013 and has a large flap/opening on one long side and then two round windows and a circular port opening on the other long side. It has a speaker opening, three buttons and a flap on the bottom short side and a speaker opening on the top short side. I know that is not that clear but hopefully it gives you enough information to make a decision."
my kindle says previous generation...what does that mean? how do i know what generation kindle i have,"Kindle Fire is 1st generation, Kindle Fire HD is 2nd Generation, Kindle Fire HDX is 3rd generation and is the current generation. Kindle Fire is the smallest."
Will this case fit the 1 generation kindle fire? Will ports all match up? I do not have kindle fire hd,The one I bought like this ( I think mine was red) did not fit the 1 generation Kindle. The Kindle was too thick and case would not close around it.
Which generation kindle fire hd does this fit?,It only fits the kindle fire hd not the hdx
Does this case fit the new 2014 Kindle Fire HD 7?,No
will this case fit the kindle previous generation? will the power port match up?,"No, it will not fit."
"I am wondering if the case has an attached plastic face like an otterbox, not a seprate sticker type cover",Correct. The screen protector part of this case is a built in part of the case. It is not a sticker type add on.
How do I get all of these bubbles out from under the screen cover??,"Hello Heather, that has been the most aggravating situation for my kids as well as me. If you can find a frame shop that has gorilla glass they can replace it for you, however I have not been able to find one. You can also order gorilla glass online and either try it for yourself or have a professional glass company that deals in windshields try and do it for you. That is my next step. One other option that helps but you will still will have a little bubbles is place the top and your Kindle and a moist free dry environment and that will help a little. The best option though it's try and get that top replaced with gorilla glass. Good luck that is better trust me, I feel your pain and aggravation."
"is this case necessary for wireless charging the lumia 1020? If I dont buy this, and only but the dt-900 charger will it work?","The 1020 cant communicate with the dt-900 without the wireless charging cover. If you look on the back of your Nokia 1020, you will notice two small circular openings near the bottom. The wireless charging cover has two prongs that actually insert into those openings when you put the cover on. In any case, this is how the cover adds in the functionality to use the NFC feature to wirelessly charge the phone. I know that was a long answer, but the short answer is ""YES the case is necessary for wirelessly charging the Lumia 1020""."
does it include the charger or only the case?,The CC-3066 is packaged with the snap on back and no other items. The charger/induction plate combination is available separately.
Can you add an additional cover over the case ? Will it still charge with a case over it to protect the phone?,"The charging cover and the charging base seem to be engineered to pretty precise specs. The charging cover is thin and permits charging to full charge in the same time as a direct wire charge. If I were going to consider a cover, ""Otter"" grade, I would have to give up on transduced charging. I enjoy the convenience of charging during the day without the hassle direct wiring. Forget the cover and enjoy the charging system of the future or go for the cover and forget the advanced charging system that Nokia has created. The 1020 discharges faster that the iPhone 5 that I had. So always being charged up is a priority for me. When at my desk, my 1020 sets on the charge plate. No wires to fiddle with to charge my phone during the day. I never know when I will be away from a charging system, so being charged up is important to me. When I retire for the night, my phone is generally 100% charged up. The feeling of a charged up phone is important to me."
"Does this case also protect the phone like other cell phone cases in case it is dropped? Also, does it add a lot of bulk or weight?",It won't protect the phone and yes it adds bulk. I only use it when I'm actively using a wireless charger. This phone would be so much better if the wireless charging was built in.
"Has anyone painted the cover? If so, what type of prep/paint did you utilize? How did it turn out?",I haven't painted anything! I just need one that works!
"Can you slip a thin cover over this charging cover and still get it to work? My 920 worked with a cover on it, might make this feasible.","So just for my understanding you want to put a case over this case? If that's what you mean I could try it out for you and see. I have ghost armor on my 1020 and I put the case over it and it still works fine, but that's just a thin protective film. Let me know in more detail what you plan on doing and I'll do a quick experiment to see what it can do."
"Does this wireless cover provide drop protection - to absorb impact of a drop? If not, is there any such case to go over this?","No, and I doubt if there is any extra cover for shock reduction unless it is specially crafted."
"When I was adjusting the cover to work consistently, i unfortunately broke the pin on one side. Will it be covered in warranty or any solution?",I am not sure. Call the manufacturer. I have not had that issue
Any clues on how to get this cover to work consistently. I cleaned the metal tabs with Lysol wipes. It worked a time or two. Now it's dead again....,It has never died on me so far. I haven't cleaned it since unpacking it.
nokia is original? works for 1020? he is black? warranty?,"Yes, original from nokia. Yes, made for the 1020. Yes, it is black. Yes, nokia warranty."
"Is the case actually available? It says ""1-3 weeks"", which isn't great, but ok, if it actually is that timeframe?",I received mine on 12 August from an different supplier. So they exist and are commercially available. I cannot comment on availabity through this channel.
What is the best protective case to use on top of the Wireless Charging Cover to protect it?,I don't use a protective case in addition to having the charging cover. There really is no need unless you work in construction or in a field where there's a lot of dust. I like having my phone as raw as possible to show off its beauty. The charging cover flattens out the rise of the rear camera lens.
Does it come with a charger and event though its refurbish is it worth buying,"Yes, the one I bought came with an european socket multivolt charger and an adapter for US use. Mine was bought new."
In that frequency works this phone? I'm looking for one that works on 3G 900 Mhz,It works on 3G in HSDPA 900 / 2100 frecuency. Sure it will fit your needs.
"is this phone FACTORY UNLOCKED, gsm and wifi",Yes to all three questions. And working perfectly!
will this fit Iphone 6 plus,"Yes, it's a standard Lightning cable."
"Is this cable really Apple certified? If so, why some reviewers said when they plugged in the cable, iPhone 5 will say it's not certified?","I have an iPhone 5 which I use with this cable and the phone has never said ""it's not certified""? In fact, this cable has worked perfect with my iPhone 5. I've had no problems and it's a much sturdier cable than apple's cable (I had to replace the cable apple gave me because it frayed)."
what makes this cable better then the rest? Ive had too many issues with lightning cables,"It's very well-made, and Tech Armor will replace it if you have any issues... no questions asked."
Does this cable fit into the iPhone 5 with the official apple leather case on?,I don't know for sure but it may not... I bought it for my phone and I have a lifeproof case on my phone and it didn't fit but my boyfriend has a leather case on his (not an apple one tho) and it for him... amazon does have a great return policy tho if you want to try it out!
Does the lightning end fit an iPhone 5S which has Tech Armor's edge protect bumper cover on it?,"Robert, yes it does! We designed it all to fit together. I hope that helps. Best, TA Support"
Will the connector fit into my iPhone 5 through an Otterbox Armor case? the opening is just large enough for the Apple cable.,"Should work ...it's a good cable and the 8 pin connector is only very, very slightly larger than the Apple cable"
Will this phone work with AT&amp;T Wireless?,"yes but only if it's unlocked, tmobile requires more than one month of service and not more than 2 per year for unlock requests"
I have an existing postpaid connection with Tmobile can i just buy this phone and use it with that connection?,Yes
"16GB with no expansion must be a little crammed, of which Windows probably takes a few. How many FREE GB are available on the phone?","After installing all my apps I have 10.7 GB free. OneDrive is now 15 GB free, so I don't have any issue with space"
Does it have voice activated GPS?,Yes it has here now which is by far one of the best GPS apps out there. I don't even use my car GPS anymore.
"So after read all reviews and questiones i'm more confused, someone said here after he bought the phone he has to ask tmobile to unlock it, and some people said here you can just put in your sim card and use it right away, i'm now a tmobile customer,...","No confusion: It may need to clarify. If your carrier is T-Mobile, you just put the SIM card in and it will work fine. If your carrier is someone else like AT&T, Verizon, you need to unlock the phone in order to use it. If the phone is unlocked, you can use it with your SIM with any carriers. Hope it helps."
DOES THIS PHONE HAVE WINDOWS 8.1?,Yes. :-)
"I read that this phone is the international version, but will it work in the US?",This specific model is for T-Mobile in the US.
will this phone work in the us?,Yes
"Does this phone have T-Mobile carrier branding on it? Logo on the front or back, or during boot-up?",Yes. Logo on the screen and during boot up.
Can the operating system still be updated to the latest version.,T mobile hasn't released the cyan update. Although att Nokia Lumia 925 has the cyan update. So the answer to your question is yes.
"which size samsung mega does this fit, mega has 2 sizes mine is the 6.3",It fits 6.3...
does this case fit the mega i527,"It fits my Sumsung Mega perfectly! I search online and think i527 is another name from AT&T for Sumsung Mega. You can confirm with your cell phone company. On the back of my phone, you will find ""GALAXY MEGA"". So you may consider to buy it if you have same wording."
"Hello, I am wondering if a samsung galaxy will fit in this type of case? -Thank you",Yes! It fits perfectly. I love it....
"Hello, I am wondering if a samsung galaxy 3.6 will fit in this type of case? -Thank you",the galaxy mega is a lot bigger then the galaxy 3 so i dont think it will fit. the mega fits in it perfectly.
How is the protection as compared to the Otterbox case?,Not as good as otterbox. If you drop or bang your phone around a fair amount then I would.go with a more rugged case. I dont mind being a little more cognisant with my phone since the battery life is so good
Does the flip cover fold back all way flat against the back of the phone when opened?,"It can. It doesn't hold there, but its quite flexible."
Why should I purchase this if the battery size is the same as a default GS4? (2600 mAh),"It has two batteries...one built into the case, and the other (which it comes with) replaces the battery presently in your phone."
Does this case work with inductive charging?,No
Does NFC and GPS work accurately with this? I have had GPS problems with extended batteries.,I haven't had any problems yet. I use the gps several times a week and haven't noticed a decrease in performance or accuracy. Not sure about about NFC interference
how do u know both of the battery charged.the cAse and the battery?,Your battery life display will represent both batteries.
how it supposed to charge? my percent go down easy :( someone help me please,What is helpful is to allow battery to go completely dead then recharge from scratch.
is this case a rechargable case? Can i use a regular case till my battery dies then use this when I need extra battery life? Trying to find a rechargable case to use on the bus while traveling.,"Yes, take your old battery out of your phone and use the case."
Is this compatible with the Active?,I dont have the active. But think the size is much different.
Can this case fit a samsung S4 I19506 as well,Yes it can.

Does the case full enclose the phone or are there cut outs?,space of the photographic camera is well defined not see a problem with that
"If i bought this case, would it look exactly like the picture?","The image is correct, but it's a little grainy/pixelated."
Do you have it for ipod 4?,Thanks for your question.Sorry to tell you that It will not fit ipod.
where is the case coming from?,I bought it from a store in Chicago
The description says it is for the iphone4 but I noticed it doesnt have the second circle for the apple sign that is on all other iphone cases...,"you mean the apple sign on the back? i had a iphone 4 and i loved it the case will fit it perfectly but it looks like a printed sticker on the back of a generic plastic phone case. it will fit your phone, but the edges will be black and its just a sticker on the back side where you see the galexy. i mean its cute and cheaply made but it will fit your iphone 4 it fit mine."
"Does this case fit a iphone 4? And is the design printed on the case, not like a sticker.",It is more like a sticker. Yes it does fit an iPhone 4
Will iphone 5s with incipio case fit,"This is the case I have and it is 0.4"" thick. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A9LVC2K/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 It fits very well in this VERY NICE case. Not loose, but not too tight either. You will love the Knox case. Very durable and the swivel feature is great for positioning while driving. One thing though, make sure the case is clipped on a belt for best security. I hook it on my waist band sometimes, but it will get pulled off. That's only happened twice, when got hung up on seat belt. My suggestion would be to not go more than 0.6"" thick. I really like the plastic cover I bought above to go with the Knox case. A winning combo!!!! Hope this helps."
"Dear Knox, I have one of your Knox Belt Clip for iPhone 5/5S/5C with Shell Case. The clip broke, do you sell th clips?",Same thing happened to me. Don't know if they sell just the clips.
If you insert the iPhone 5s upside down can you then use this case with headphones?,"Yes, the headphone port is clear of the magnetic strap. It should work fine."
I have a iPhone 5c with a Survivor case - do you think this will fit this case? Thanks in advance.,"If that is the thick otter box case, I would guess no"
Is the iPhone 5 case or the iPhone 5 with shell case a better fit for a phone without a case?,"We purchased the case for the ""iPhone 5"". My husband didn't have a case around his iPhone, and it fits like a glove -- just perfectly. After seeing how it fits, if you don't have a case on your iPhone, definitely go for the one designed for a phone without a case. Unless, you want a loose fit, I guess. My husband likes a tight fit so he knows definitely that it won't fall out regardless of what he is doing."
I have iPhone 5c with a casemate case. Would this be too tight,I think so I think it's about the same size as the s 5
After owning this for six months the swivel clip broke. Is there anyway to get replacement parts?,Yes
Will it fit perfectly an iPhone 5 with an adopted leather wrap case,I doubt it. I had a rubbierized shell and had to discard it for a slick plastic shell that would slide in and out of the Knox easily. But the knox is a good case.
I have a shell case that is a little less than 1/2 an inch wide. Do you think this Knox case will work?,"It will be tight but it should work. I have an iPhone 5s with the Apple shell that is 0.4"" thick and it fits nicely with a little room to spare. It was pretty tight at first but stretched a little over the first couple of weeks."
I have a iPhone 5s with incipio frequency case - will it fit?,Nope! The only way it will fit is with no case. I had to returm mine. So sad. It is a beautiful case.
where can I find replacement belt clips,Not sure. Mine has not broken.
iphone 4,I can only guarantee it works on a 5S.
Is the belt clip removable?,"No, the belt clip is not removable. It rotates 360 degrees with a click-stop every 15 degrees."
"I have a Luvvitt clear case it is very slim. Size (LWH): 4.96 inches, 2.36 inches, 0.39 inches. Will your smaller holster fit this case?",The case will fit an iPhone 5s only without a case.

Does anyone have good or bad experiences using the camera grip?,"You have to take the phone out of this case to put the camera grip on. I love the camera grip, however because of the added bulk, I only use it when I'm planning taking pictures, or when I am expecting to need extra battery life. The phone is snug inside. I have Zagg invisible shield on both the front and back as well, and the phone does not come out of the camera grip easily. However, I'm not sure if that's because of the Zagg product on the phone, or because the camera grip is really grippy. Either way, if I had it to do all over again, I would definitely pick up the camera grip. -Maddy @transatheistpod"

Does it use BT 4.0 &amp; Dolby Digital Plus like the new Jabra ROX? Thanks.,"Even though it doesn't have BT 4.0, the benefits of 4.0 vs 3.0 do not impact sound quality from what I have read while researching bluetooth headphones. This is because streaming music is a high bandwidth activity and BT 4.0 improvements are in low energy low bandwidth applications. The Jaybird BlueBuds have excellent sound quality but run BT 2.1 + EDR. I'm wondering if it effects standby time though, but I don't really care about that with bluetooth headphones. The sound quality comes more from the codec used (aptX or jaybird's Shift) and the quality of the headphone itself. This headphone has aptX and a balanced armature driver, which is a very good combination. I'd definitely test them both out and decide for myself which are better."
why is it disconnected so often? Do I need to charge it up or.... ? I unboxed it and use it but after a day it disconnected very often.,"I think i may have your answer, i have the same problem, but it happens because when you connect your Bluetooth headset to your phone, your WiFi disrupts the connection that it has made to you phone's network. I know because it happens to me, I do not use my WiFi with my Bluetooth headset, i have better strength and signal with my network. If i use my WIFI, it pops out sporadically, i think it is because the signal strength wavers, and therefore causing many disconnections, hope this helps..."

Can this be used with cases? Looking at otterbox defender or tirdent cyclops. Was hoping to use this glass and remove the cases plastic.,Yes the otter box defender will work with this with no problem
Greetings - Are the edges of the glass squared or rounded over?,"The edges are square. They still feel nice, however I would recommend a case as the protector just barely comes above handset's edge. I use the Fosmon DURA S SERIES SLIM-Fit Flexible TPU Case which extends above the protector enough that laying face down isn't a worry."
"I heard this was fixed when the 4.4 update was realesed as far as the proximity sensor, are their any other roblems and is it worth buying?",****EDIT****I This answer was for another product. I changed it to reflect this product.***Once you lay the screen protector down you can not lift it up to readjust. The youtube video I saw said it was ok to try and adjust it if you don't get it lined up the first time. I centered the speaker hole and then realized the speaker cutout was not centered. once i lifted it back up it would not reapply. and yes they changed something because the speaker grill no longer centers like explained in the video I watched. LIkea few reviews said buy 3 because you may need to use them all just to get one clean install with no dust.
Is it redesigned not to cover the proximity sensor?,"No they have not been redesigned. I was told, over the phone, that they had been redesigned. I bought one and found that they hadn't."
Is this screen protector for the Moto X 2014 second gen phone? Thanks,No this is for the first generation Moto X
How well do the curves/angles of this protector's edges match the actual glass on the phone?,"I find that the glass matches the moto x' curves and angles rather well. I'm writing this response on my second i-Blason, and I can attest that it is absolutely bubble free. There is a slight gap around the edges, but I find that it helps with case compatibility."
"Want to use this with the otterbox defender, if i use it should i cut out the otterbox screen protecter?",You can just poke it out. You don't have to cut it. The screen protector in the otter is glued in and if you just push real hard itll pop out.just make sure you clean the glue off before you put your phone in there
"Does it provide high power (2A or is it low power, I want to power a LG G3 or Galaxy S5)",I use mine with my nexus 7 2014 version that uses a 1.7a charger and don't notice a power drain while in use.

Is the RM-875 or the RM-877 a better choice if I will be going to school in Rome over the next 6 years with occasional visits back to the US?,"I would say 875, as AT&T tends to ""rape"" their phones - for example tethering is disabled and even if you unlock the phone or restore it with the Nokia Recovery Tool, you still cannot use that feature... If there are other specific features you want that 877 has and 875 doesn't, then that is a different story, but I'd say stay away from the Death Star..."
"What does ""NONE AT&amp;T or LOGO"" mean?","On the front and back cover, there is no printed at&t logo. When the phone boots up, there is no at&t splash screen either. It only displays the generic Nokia and windows phone screen."

"i bought the phone but the camera doesnt seem to work properly the focus is not working,can you help me guys fix that//?","first things first, be sure that it's in auto mode. There's also a manual focus mode. To check all your settings, simply swipe the shutter button up, you'll see the manual setting sliders. Check if the focus slider rests in auto mode. If it is not, slide all the way to your left, and leave it there. If this is not the case, check for the updates. First you gotta be sure that you're running the latest version of both the OS and the camera app. If no updates available, try to uninstall and install the camera app again. If nothing works, could be a hw problem. Let me know how it goes. Cheers."

But the very reason why I bought it is because it is UNLOCKED. That itself means it operates with any carrier. The reason why cells don't work with any carrier is because they are locked under specific code to allow only specific SIM to work with but those are of course cells purchased with a contract and cost 50$ instead of 700$. But that if you ask me is a contract with a devil. With Blu you not only get a fabulous Samsung Galaxy S3 analogue, you get it for 180$ and NO contract!!! Definetely a YES for the purchase if you ask me:)."

It appears to not work with voice comand with my droid. Is there a secret,you need to have bluetooth version 4 on tour phone in order to support voice comand
is it compatible with a Samsung cell phone?,As long as the phone has bluetooth it should be able to interact with it. I hope that helps.
does it work with your music playlist too,I wouldn't recomend for listening music. Frequency range and dynamic ranges are limited to vocal range. It is great unit for phone conversation. Very clear and last long as they claimed.
I have msn sync in my Escape and need better mic than the one the phone. It sounds like I am talking through long tunnel. Will this work?,"I have a Kia Rio. It does not have msn sync or any other device, so I can't compare it with the quality you currently have. Sorry! I am still in love with it."

"Can this mount in any orientation? Meaning, does it self align or have the ability to manually align to the landscapes orientation? (i.e. if I mount it on a 45 degree angle will the video still be parallel to the ground?)","Yes it can. It' almost like your smart phone it will adjust the screen back to center parallel to the ground. However, when you start to record it will capture all angles like a normal camera should. When you mount the camera upside down it will correct the orientation BEFORE you record. Does that help?"

"Please confirm that this will properly fit the samsung s4MINI, verizon model. Other answers say no! Please confirm this is right cover to fit. Thanks.","I purchased the holster two or three months ago, and it continues to hold and protect my S4MINI as advertised. I needed a sturdy and dependable belt clip holster, and this does the job."
does this case have a built in screeen protector,"No it does not, i have been very pleased with this purchase"
Does the case hold the phone properly? One review said it does not. The buttons on the side are difficult to press and the case keeps rising. Thanks,"I honestly didn't have any issue with the buttons. The case fit perfectly on my S4 mini, and was actually pretty tough to get off once it's on the phone. I use the case with the belt clip when I'm at work and it stays in place just fine. :)"
How hard is it to get the phone out of the clip part of the holster? Do you just push up from the bottom?,"Yes, hold the sides and push up from the bottom. The phone is very secure in the holster."

how long are the wires? i would like to discreetly keep this under clothes with a phone in my pocket. will the wires be long enough?,"Not sure on the actual length, but I know they're long enough. I'm 6'2"" and can wear it with my phone in pants pocket and the mic cord is long enough to run down a sleeve. I can say that the ptt button does not work with iPhones."
Does it work with a Samsung Galaxy S5?,It should work fine if the Galaxy have a 3.5mm slot
Wanting to get this for my phone and phone calls. Is the quality good enough to spend my money on this? Specifically the sound and product quality.,"This product does what it says it will do. Now I will tell you, because the earbud is it does not allow your ear to breath. You can change it out, but the sound quality will go down. I used similar ear devices when I am on duty with my radio and I can not tell you the benefits of them. If you are in Law Enforcement then it is the way to go. This device works with my Iphone 4s. It allowed me to use Voxer wonderfully, people could hear me and I could hear them. Now, siri will work with the PPT function... but it is not the best thing. Over all it does what it says its going to do. I will be buying another one for my boss for Christmas. Hope this helps."
Does the microphone work with Samsung Android phones,Yes
"What is the sound quality like on this, I dont need high definition but is it easy to understand people in a call and to speak and be heard clearly?","I had a very difficult time hearing a conversation, my volume was all the way up and it still sounded like the person was whispering not good sound quality"
"Just and to be 100% sure, It does have a mic?",Yes it does
is it dual bead or just for one ear,Just 1 ear.
iPad mini? S2?,"I like mine, I use it for LEO work. It's very clear to hear out of, can't feel wearing it. I'm sure it will work on your devices, I'm using it on a radio."
how do i put it together ????????????????/,"Plug the clear ear piece into the black round end, that's how you hear the conversation, the other black end, the box shaped piece, is how you talk. At the other side of the black cord is the auxiliary jack which plugs into your device"
"cant get the ptt to work on my iphone4 shouldnt plugging this into my phone disable the phones built in mics so i can ptt , but it doesnt?","It's not ptt, once you plug it in you can already talk, the button mutes the sound so that whomever you are talking to cannot hear what's being said"
"Anyone know how many AMPS this charger is? 12W yes, but at how many A?","4.8 Amps total. 2.4 Amps per port. 2.4 Amps per port x 2 ports = 4.8 Amps. 12W x 2 = 24W 24W / 5V = 4.8A This unit is called reVOLT 12W + 12W by Scosche. So 24 Watts, not 12."
How come this doesn't work with my Samsung Galaxy S 5? Even tried with the original cable that came with the phone.,"You need a charge only cable. You can make one but just buy one. Do not use that cable to connect to your computer, though...may or may not short the computer's USB port. The unique feature of charge only cable is that the communication wires are severed and shorted together on the micro-USB end and left open circuited on the USB end. Your phone sends a signal out on one of the data wires and if the signal comes back, it accepts 2 amps. If it does not come back, it accepts around half that. The reason your Samsung Cable and wall charger work is because the wall chargers are wired that way so the cable needn't be a charge only cable. I have thus far been unable to find a cigarette lighter USB charger that has the data wires configured like a wall charger. So it is actually your phone that is limiting the charging rate at the moment. Pick up a charge only cable and you'll be all set."
Could anyone confirm if I will be able to charge a Samsung Galaxy S4 with this charger? Headed overseas soon and need a charger for rental car.,I have used this on my Galaxy S4. I have had no problems with it charging.
What kind of cable is included? The description says it's only a 3-ft cable. Thanks.,There is no cable included. You need to add your own.
Can this charge 2x ipad 4s @ 2.4 Amp @ 30C ambient temp for at least 1 hour without overheat? need to know to justify products price and functionality,I have charged 1 ipad4 and 1 ipad1 with no over heating problem.
Does the LED light stay on all the time?,"Whenever there is power to the 12 outlet it is pluged into, yes. Some vehicals supply power to those 12v outlets/Cig lighters only when the key is on. And some supply power for 5 -10 min after the vehical is off or until the headlights turn off (courtesy lights). Some older vehicals supplied power continuously."
is this compatible with quick charge 2.0,No
"From the model number (USBC242M) it should be the reVOLT 12W + 12W, however, the image in this listing does looks like reVOLT c2. Please enlighten me.",The photos on scosche.com show the reVOLT 12W+12W as having black USB ports and the reVOLT c2 as having white ports. I have the reVOLT 12W+12W and it does have the black USB ports and the side label says 2.4A per port. The photo may be incorrect but the side label should identify the device.
"I am still confused, will this charger provide 2.4A per port? (12W + 12W)",Yes it will.
How will this device affect the car battery when left plugged in and not charging a device?,Insignificant quiescent current
Does the floral image on the back wear off as some of the reviews stated?,Yes it has worn off
Would it work for the iphone 5c? It says in the description iphone 5 so idk!,I ordered for a Samsung Gallaxy 4.
Does this fit the S4 Active?,"Not sure how different the S4 active is from the s4, but it fits my s4 beautifully. Go to otterbox.com and see if they have different cases for the s4 and the s4 active."
I noticed the packaging is from AT&amp;T. Does it matter that my phone is from Verizon?,It doesn't matter what carrier you have as long as its the otterbox for your specific phone.
will this work on galaxy s4 from tmobile,"Yes it will, as long as it is Samsung Galaxy S4, no matter what network provider you have."
it says works with bluetooth 4.o will it work with 3.0 or do you have to have 4.0 im lost. i looked at my phone and i cant find out motorola atrix hd,"Yes, this model also work with 3.0."
How can it be stereo when there's only one?,A another headset with cable is included in the package.
Is this item work with SumSung S2 ?,"Yes, sure, it works with all of the Bluetooth enabled devices."
"hey, is this work for samsung note 2?","absolutely no,"
"Will this SIM card reader work on my Samsung Galaxy S4 SGH-I337 16GB. Currently, the phone is utilizing 4.4.2 android version operating system.","this sim card works for the AT&T version of this phone, not sure if it works for other providers."
Will this work for US Cellular,It depends on your phone model (unlocked or not) Doesn't have anything to do with this item
What country does this item ship from?,we shipped from China and takes 7--10 working days to USA
"I need one of these tomorrow. Do you offer overnight shipping, and how much?",sorry we don't offer overnight shipping
"I have a s4 AT&amp;T phone ,will this work for any carrier phone?",no it will not unless it is unlocked either from your carrier or you unlock it your self.
"Is this compatible and will it fit in a T-Mobile Galaxy S4, SGH-M919?","Yes it is. It is a cheaper version, not OEM but it does the job."
How do these lenses attache to the S4,It comes with a clip that can be used with just about any phone.
how do i know it will fit around my htc one m7 camera? i know its a magnet. and will it cover the flash for good?,Yeah
Can this work on the front facing camera as well?,No
Would this work with an iPhone 6?,Yes I think so. It's adaptable to most phones with a flat surface and autofocus capabilities.
Will they fit an iPhone 5S with an Otterbox Defender case?,"I don't believe it will. This isn't a very good device. I bought it for my Galaxy S4 Active and it did nothing for the camera that it couldn't already do. Maybe or lower end cameras it will work, but not for the newer ones."
"Hi, my phone is a Galaxy S4 mini GT9195. Do this camera lens fix to this galaxy?","Because of how generic this kit is, the lenses could probably be used on almost any camera phone you can think of. If your phone doesn't have metal around its camera for the magnets to stick to, you simply apply the magnetic ring, which is sticky like a Post-It note, and then attach the lenses to the magnetic ring."
I have a Samsung Galaxy S3 and i have read a couple of the negative reviews. are they magnetic or double sided sticker? are they stable?,yes they are double sided. I did not have any issue with the stability and the lens fits snuggly
Does this work on the MyTouch HTC phone?,Im sure it does. I have galaxy s4 and it does the job. For the price you cant go wrong anyway.
Does it cover the back flash for HTC One M7? Can it be also be used on the front camera?,"I personally didn't like this product, it didn't fit my galaxy s4. It comes with other little magnets, but they won't stay so the pense falls right off. Maybe I did it wrong, but I didn't like it"
can i use this lenses with a phone case on? my phone is note 2,"Probably, I can with my samsung gs 2"
Would this Diztronic case allow the Moto X to be stood up on the edge for when you're viewing a video?,"No, the edges are all rounded, and there's no kickstand."
Does the case preserve the Moto X's curved back? And does it have enough of a lip to protect if the phone falls on its front?,The case makes it a little more evened out but it does maintain a slight curve. The lip does help to protect the front but it wouldn't help if it hit a jagged edge. I have dropped it already on the front and back and there is no noticeable damage.
does this case snap on like the hard plastic otter boxes,"Does this case snap on? Well, yes, but don't expect an audible, 'Plastic' sounding click. This case has a snug fit, and you can feel it 'snap' into place, but since the case is semi flexible you won't hear it. Rest assured though, that the case will stay in place until you WANT to take it off. Hope this helps."
"Is the case ""slippery"" enough to slide into pocket easily? Does it add a lot of bulk? I like the Moto X because of it's size.",It slides very easily into pocket. Does not add any significant bulk. For the price it is definitely worth it if your end goal is to protect your phone from scratches without adding bulk.
Does this also fit Moto X Developer edition?,Yes
Does this case retain the 'M' dimple in the back? Pic doesn't look like it but pics aren't always accurate.,Nope. It covers it up. The dimple is overrated :)
can this case fit on Motorola Moto X XT1058 -16GB Black,"Yes, worked for mine"
Is it slippery?,No
Is the black opaque (not able to see through it) or is it slightly transparent (showing parts of the color of the actual phone)?,Not able.
does it fit the new released moto x( september 2014),My moto x is brand new so I'm assuming it the one your asking about. It fits the phone fine just the opening for the speaker on the back is on the wrong side!
Will it fit the Republic Wireless Moto X?,Yep. I actually bought the white version from republic. Its the exact same phone as far as dimensions across all carriers.
"Will this ""color"" hide the color of the phone?","The colored ones will certainly hide or at least alter the color of your custom back. No surprise there. The clear one still alters the color a bit since it has a frosted finish on the inside. On my green-backed Moto X, the green looks much more subtle than I prefer and the signature, which is silver, almost disappears due to the frosted finish. That's really my only disappointment."
moto x,"It fits my moto x great. Was a little snug going on, but that's to be expected."
Does this case have a dimple or opening for the dimple??,No dimple...
"PROTECTION: This looks like a nice case, but does it offer high protection? And grip?","I wouldn't say it gives high protection at all, but is more of a soft plastic outer layer. Also makes for a better grip than with the phone alone. It keeps the thin profile. This is just what I was looking for."
Does the clear case yellow like the old matte frosted s3 case from diztronic?,No not so much... I have had it for a couple of months and it still looks clear frost with no yellow.
Many menus on Android apps require you to pull from the left to access the menu functions (like Spotify). Can this be easily done with this case?,Yes. The case ends before the edge of the screen. You should have no trouble.
Does it cover the volume/power button?,"it does cover the volume/power buttons, but it has its own raised buttons that you can press and they work just fine."
Are the buttons on the Moto X version easy to destinguish and use by feel?,Yes they are covered but you can distinguish by a raised dimple where the buttons are. Very easy to use and works perfectly.
Will this fit a Droid 3?,It lists the phone it supports on the product page under the In Stock box. droid 3 isn't on that list ...Moto X here
Where is it made?,"The sticker under the battery cover says it was made in Korea, assembled in China. It's a poj worldwide."
Does Waterproof body mean that if the phone is dropped and submerged in water it will still work?,Have dropped mine in water and still works. Very ruged phone
"does this phone have an sd card slot? if it does, is it under the battery or on a side?","It does have a micro sd card slot, next to the battery but under the back cover. This way the phone is ""waterproof"". Except that if it falls out of your shirt pocket, the back cover pops off, the battery falls out, and if it happens to fall in a puddle, the phone is toast. DO NOT buy this phone!!! Almost any other phone on the planet in it's price range has a better interface, is easier to use, a better camera, etc. Samsung is playing on the reputation of the old flip-phone Rugby (which was amazingly tough) to sucker people into buying this POJ."
"can my husband use it on net10 and what comes in the box with the phone? (charger,earbuds,etc)",Just.charger. it fits samsung.phone s
Does this have wifi calling capability?,yes it does fully
Does this phone come with a charger? I am waiting on a response from the seller. Thank You.,yes when I receive my Samsung Rugby it did come with the charger
Can I activate this unlocked phone for use with my verizon contract?,i dont know
how big is the screen?,"About the size of a credit card, slightly bigger maybe, but not by a lot."
can i use this with the straight talk service?,"Straight Talk is an mvno service that utilizes the network several different mobile carriers. So short answer is yes. You need to find out what signal is strongest where you'll be using your device and order the sim card that works best. If AT&T is the strongest signal, buy a sim card that works with AT&T. If T/MO, order appropriately. I don't believe the Rugby device works on Sprint or Verizon though. If your present service is AT&T, I suggest using Cricket, whose service doesn't throttle down data speeds, like Straight Talk does."
Will this phone work in Canada with Bell,Yes it will!
Is the black item really black or grey? Looking at the product image it seems gray!,"it is black, but is a little bit lighter than the Z1"
does this come with screen protectors as someone mentioned?,"No, mine didn't. I didn't see any information about screen protectors on the product descriptio, so I wasn't even expecting it."
Does it fit the Xperia Z1 LTE C6906?,Yes
Does this case fit the T-Mobile Sony Xperia Z1S?,"No it doesn't fit the Z1S properly, the sd card slot and the charging port are opposite and thus you would have to remove the case when you charged the phone."
Is it hard? Or is it some kind of gel?,"It is not a soft gel, nor is it hard and smooth. Sort of a thin, textured shell. Very nice to grip, and fits perfectly."
Is it possible to use this product with the magnetic charger DK-31?,"Yes, it certainly will. However, it involves some tweaking. The supplied adapters are obviously too thin to support the phone in a case. So, I took the thinner of the two adapters and with a Dremel tool removed the front and bottom sides, leaving only the back. Took about 10 mins to do. After that, phone fits in like a glove. The only case I know of that just works straight out of the box with the DK031 is the Case-Mate Barely There However, it has zero protection for that side of the phone."
"Does this allow passthrough charging, where you can charge the juice box and a device plugged into the juice box at the same time? Can you charge 2?","No, mine would not. There was no charge going to my device while the juice box was charging. As soon as I removed the charge cord to the juice box my IPhone began to charge."
how do you turn on the light?,Press the 'on' button twice quickly to turn on and off the light.
does it work with a nexus 5 ? thanks i appreciate your answer,"I see no reason it wouldn't, it powers a gs3, gs4, nexus 7, 3ds xl, and a ds lite. It should be providing the same amount of power that a wall adapter provides to the USB cable. The manufacturer is quick to reply and extremely helpful if my answer is not sufficient though."
Can you charge the Juice Box with a 2A charger? It's labeled with 5V/1A but will a 5V/2A fry it?,No problem at all. The Juice Box will only draw the 1A. This goes for most devices.
Does this require a seperate charger or does the charger come with it?,"Theres one cord.. It has a usb that you can plug into the computer to charge it, which is the same usb that you use to charge your phone. Also, to operate the flashlight, you must push the power button twice. That wasn't in the documentation that came with it."
Could I get an exact weight and how does it fare in water ?,"2\3 lbs but if you ask me, because of shape feels like a Pound. As for water, don't hold your breath. This is not water tight in anyway! I did give mine to my sister who has an iPhone and she Loves it! For the price it's far better for the price than I have seen other, also a lot more charge. Like I said, the weight is wierd because of the shape."
Why do you recommend total discharge every few months even though this a Lithium Ion battery and that it is not recommended for those batteries?,"What I have found with lithium ion batteries is that when you don't drain the battery even few months even though they say you don't need to.. The battery becomes disproportionate in its charge. Letting it run all theway down allows it to evenly charge. I do it with all my devices. Just let them run out every few months and get a longer, better charge. Li-batteries normally have a strong life 2 to 3 years. My batteries average 4 to 6. And yes I use all of devices daily."
is this compatable for the Q10,Yes with the right USB Cable
Is it compatible and can be charge on Ipad 2?,Yes
Does it have a light or anything to let me know how much charge it has?,When the power bank is charge the light is red and when you see a green light then it's fully charged
"How does this charger charge up? I'm seeing how you would connect it to the phone via USB, but how do you connect it to the wall to charge it up?",You only charge it Via the USB cable connected then to your Tv if you have a USB socket or to your PC/Laptop because it does not come supplied with a wall charger but if you have one for a Cell/Mobile phone then just use that with the supplied USB cable and all will be good.
"buy this battery does not work me, I do ???????",Give it an overnight charge to see if it will kick in. If not contact customer services.
does it work for galaxy note 3 and iPhone 5,Yes
how long it takes to charge it? i dont want to over charge it.,It usually takes 6-8 hours.
"DOES THIS CHARGE iPHONE 5C, 5s or samsung stratosphere?",It charges anything with a cord that one end is USB. So yes it charges the iPhone 5.
"Lightning connector is not included for the iphone 5, but will it charge the iphone 5??",Yes! It sure can
Does it come in retail packaging?,"Yes, it is."
Hello - I bought this device and can't figure out how to charge it - I hook it up to my computer but no light comes on. Defective?,"I always plug it into a wall charger to charge it, so I'm not sure if that makes a difference. However, you would think the charging light would come on either way, so it may very well be defective."
does this charger come with the 5 adapters shown in the picture?,"Yes, there are 5 adapters in the package."
"How to know when the juice box needs to be charged? The manual says: ""The charging lights flashing, a few lights when fully charged."" What?","Hello Julie, my take on this is the device needs charging when only one of the four LEDs is on - if the Juice Box is near to being totally flat then the last LED will flash and the device will certainly need charging. Hope this helps. Paul"
"my battery doesn't take a charge, would this work to power on my phone or would the internal battery need to be functional?",You would have to test it both ways!
I wanto to use this to power other USB devices - but it automatically turns off after about 20 seconds. How do I prevent this?,"Mine doesn't do this, so I suggest you contact technical support for OXA."
"If I have the bank fully charged, how many times will I be able to charge my Galaxy S4 from that? I need something like for camping for 4 days.",Yup!
"When charging this, how can you tell when it's fully charged?",See the blue disc in the picture on the product page? See the four small dots? Those are LED lights. It is fully charged when all lights are lit.
is it water proof,yes
Looks like it blocks the front camera does it and also how does the silent button work,It does not block the camera and the silent button works awesome ! It's a great case! Just know that it's a little heavy. It's literally a tank. I love mine tho
Looks like it blocks the front camera does it and also how does the silent button work,"It doesn't block the front camera, and the silent button works perfectly. It does, however, add plenty of extra weight to your phone and surely does interfere with the signal coming to it. I loved it for a while but stopped using it because of the extra bulk and decreased reception. It's a good heavy case for the price if you're a member of a bomb squad!"
"i need a case for iphone 5c, do you have one????",Yes I have one.

Will this charge on iPhone 3? Thanks,It charges my iPhone 5 so it should definitely charge the 3. As long as a phone has a USB charging cable it will work.
"In full sunlight, how long does it take to charge an iPhone from completely drained to 100%? How long does it take to charge a 10,000 mah battery?","A long time! I've never quite accomplished this because my Allpowers 7 watt quits charging my iPhone5 phone (using an Apple charger) after a few minutes. I receive that annoying error message """"This accessory is not made to work with iPhone"" and it stops charging my phone!!"

Is this compatible with iPhone 5?,Yes
is this compactible with kindle,"I've charged both my old Kindle reader and a Kindle fire from this device, but it is a bit slow on anything less than a vert bright day. Does not always produce enough power for my iPad to recognize it and charge. I normally use the panel to charge a back-up battery unit then charge my devices from the battery."
Will this charge a IPad ?,"In bright sunlight, usually not a problem. In less ideal conditions, the available wattage may not be enough to ""Trip the trigger"" of the iPad charging circuit. But that is true of any solar system at some point; there are some days where I can't get my 45watt panel to charge an iPad."
What is the exact weight of the panel?,I'm not sure but it pretty light weight. I expected more from it in terms of charging capacity/speed. Not too bad but not as much as I would like.

Does this come with the case for the phone? I'm not quite sure how this works...,No
Will the suction cup work as effectively on a metal surface? I'm planning to mount this on my Vespa.,I doubt it. The suction works great on glass but other surfaces it WILL fall I tried
"I have a Vespa and there's really no bar where the bike mount fits. If I get suction cup version, will this work effectively on a plastic windscreen?","You need to check if the windscreen is flat. The suction cup is really good, but it may not work properly on curve surfaces."
can you buy the windshield attachment seperatly,Yes
Will this hold an iPad air? use it for gps.,"The stand can handle it, but the standard suction cup will probably give out fast."
How do you get the phone off the car mount? I had to remove the phone from the case to get it off...and now the case is stuck to the car mount. Could,"To get the case off the bracket, all you need to do is turn the phone 45 If the case still spends and doesn't come off, tighten the thumbscrew on the back of the bracket"
"Would this be easy to switch between vehicles, or would the suction cup start to wear out pretty quickly if it is mounted and remounted regularly?","I've had it for about a year, the suction cup is pretty thick/tough so I'd not expect it to wear out. That said mine is pretty much in one car all the time."
"When mounted with the adhesive dash adapter, does the adhesive dammage the dashboard at all and will it come off without residue if needed?","I suspect that it will not damage modern polymer dashboards. A vinyl dashboard (or laminated dashboard) may be susceptible to damage. However, I cannot be sure. Personally, I would trust the product, because everything else I have by them is top quality (bike mount, suction cup mount, poncho screen cover, cases, etc.)."

From your question it seems like you are saying that your Digitizer and LCD Screen are both broken. This listing is for the Digitizer only. You would need to buy the LCD Screen separately, or find a listing that sells the two parts together. Thank you"
how much costs shiping to albania?,$9.99
I just need to purchase the LCD screen and mobile adhesive separately. Is that correct?,"It depends on the model you have. Basically there are 3 things in a screen, the LCD screen, the glass and the digitizer (which helps in the swipe etc). Depending on the model nokia 920, you can buy LCD separate and the digitizer with screen depending on what is broken, but for nokia 930 and later version, the LCD, Screen and Digitizer are sandwiched and comes bound together. So, check your model first before deciding on purchase"
"I would like to know if you can ship for me an accessories of Lumia 920? my Lumia Screen is Broken, but i live in Angola, what can i do?","Unfortunately, we do not offer International shipping."

does this case fit a lumia 530,I believe it's only for the 520. Sorry I couldn't be more help
will an lumia 521 case fit an 520,"I personally have an 521, but I did some research for you to help you out. It turns out that the 521 is just a bit longer than the 520, so if you are going to buy this cover it might be a bit loose, but in my opinion, I think it will work just fine.

is it suitable for a nokia lumia 520 and i mean does it fit propaly,"I would say that it is slightly loose, but considering the fact that it's a rubbery case that is to be expected. I loved the case so much I barely even cared! It is a great product!"

Is this compatible with a droid razr m?,Yes it has adapters for everything.
This phone work in Venezuela.? is Fast.. What version android.?,"The only thing that is true about this phone is the RUGGEDNESS. Every other spec are false. The phone has only 4GB internal Storage, 700MB System Installation space. Which can hardly take Facebook, messenger, twitter, whatsapp & bbm without complaining of insufficient storage. As against the advertised 8GB internal Storage & 1GB System Installation. The phone hangs alot & does restart at will for no reason. So if you are really looking for fast please stay off, but if you are looking for a phone to JUST MAKE CALLS ONLY & NOT USE THE INTERNET FACILITY YOU CAN GO AHEAD WITH IT."
Hello. is this phone unlocked and able to use verizon wireless?,The phone is a GSM phone and not compatible with the Verizon CDMA network.
"its unlocked?, im from venezuela,","Completely locked, and impossible to Unlock, since NEC has taken away support."
Is the memory card included or do you have to buy that separately?,No memory card included.
Can you replace the operating system? It would seem that replacing the operating system would improve its performance.,"Technically, if you knew how to root the phone and such you could. I am not certain on how that pertains to the manufacturers warranty or AT&T policies. But as a matter of technical can do's; then yes. It would be possible."
want to use for straight talk. is it compatible?,"Technically yes, since you can take just about any GSM or CDMA phone to Straight Talk. You may want to contact them just to be certain though. Also, if it is not unlocked from AT&T you will need to contact them first to have it unlocked. Which from everything I have heard, has been a hassle with this particular phone."

How to power off when not carrying stock cable.,I dont think this product can be turn off when someone not carrying stock cable. It has its own inteligent circuit board to keep battery from leaking out. so you dont have to worry about the battery gone from the power bank
This might be a stupid question but..........how do I recharge this battery?,"You use the included orange USB cable to plug into any USB charger (like the one that came with your phone) or USB port on a computer/laptop. Because of this battery's size you'll want to use a charger capable of putting out 2 amps, though anything 1 amp and above will suffice. More amps = shorter charging time. I believe the specs say it'll take 7 hours at 2.1A to charge so roughly double that time at 1 amp."
Does it also good for Nokia Lumia 1520 &#xFF1F;thx,"Yes, it will."

Can i use this for Samsung S5?,"Yep, any device with a USB cable"
can you plug in other micro usb cables than what it cames with?,Yes
does this plug directly into phone or connected by cable,It has a USB standard port like you would find on a computer and it also has a mini USB port on it. I have an iPhone and just plug the charging cable into the standard USB port like you would find on your computer and it does the job.
How many times can it discharge power?,"Under normal circumstances (product temperature and current stability) and to ensure that the discharge 500, the conversion rate remains at 85%."
Won't the recharging time be long since the capacity of this charger is big?,"The input speed for this power bank is 2.1A / 5V and will finish recharging within 7 hours, which is faster than most on the market. Just plug it in before you go to sleep!"

"Will this charge e-ink Kindles, like the basic model and the paperwhite?","Short answer = Yes, it will (I have the 1st gen Kindle touch with the e-ink screen and just plugged it in to verify for you). Longer answer = It'll charge faster than the stock Kindle charger because the stock charger's output is 500mA (.5 Amps) and this one has the 1 Amp (1000 mA) output and 2.4 Amp (2400 mA) output charge ports. Unsolicited advice = Don't do it. For two reasons- 1) If you look right above the charging port on the back of the Kindle, you should see ""INPUT 5.25V MAX 500mA"" meaning the maximum voltage rating for the Kindle's charging circuitry and battery type is 5.25 volts (standard USB output) and maximum current rating is .5 Amps- or HALF that of the lower power output of this charger- so there's a very real possibility that you could damage the Kindle. If you do damage it this way, Amazon most likely won't cover this damage under the warranty because it'll be obvious the circuitry was overloaded rather than failed as the result of a manufacturing flaw. 2) Power output and potentially damaged electronics aside, I can't recommend this charger. Whatever the hinge mechanism is inside this charger is apparently a very poor design. I've had it for maybe 3 weeks, folded and unfolded it POSSIBLY 8 or 9 times and the hinge is already lose enough that when plugged in, the slightest bump causes the charger to spark as the mechanism separates and re-contacts. At best, this is an annoyance because it means the charger could sit an an angle that keeps it from charging your device if the hinge never reconnects. At worst, it's a pretty significant fire hazard (I've stopped using mine and it's going in the garbage)."
So this would be safe to charge two iPhone 5Cs at the same time?,Mine works with an iPad2 and iPhone 4 at the same time so I would think 2 5c should be good.

What does the blinking blue light mean? I'm trying to charge ipad 2nd gen and iPhone 5.,It's right there in the description for the product: one port 1A maximum and the other port 2.4A maximum with blue LED indicator. So it means you've plugged a cable into the port with the 2.4A maximum. They're labeled right above each port which is which.

How long do the panels hold the charge? Meaning if I have a sunny day and leave it out to charge can I use it 3 days later?,The panels do not hold a charge themselves. You can charge directly from the panels or connect an external battery (not included) and charge that as your future power source.
Just how durable is this? Is it really safe to toss it in a backpack with a bunch of other stuff and just hike on without worrying about cracking?,"It is pretty hardy for a solar panel. I take it backpacking and store it on the outside of my bag. Last hike I forgot I had it on the outside pocket of my pack and tossed it waist-belt up in my trunk. It was 50lbs. I thought for sure I broke something. It was fine. I seriously am blown away by this thing. Get it. Treat it best you can of course. I will never forget where it is attached again! it is a solar panel after all, they are inherently a bit fragile."
Has anyone tried using it from inside a car? does the appropriate wavelength go thru auto glass?,In Nebraska fall and winter sunlight expect a huge decrease (or stop) in efficiency behind even a windshield on a modern car/truck. Any tint / uv protection seems to drop the performance.
Does this have an internal battery it stores a charge in to be used later? Or will only charge directly to other devices?,"It only charges directly to other devices, there is no internal storage battery.

Does anyone know if this solar panel charger can be hooked together with another one for more charging power?If so how is this done?,Easy answer--no.

Can the 14W panel charge a 12V car battery? Or is the output on for 5V? Is there a USB to gator clip wires I can buy?,The voltage is wrong you need a 12v panel directly to the car battery.

"Samsung S4 Active users: When on the QI charger it does not constantly charge. It charges, stops, charges, stops. Any suggestions?",I have had that a couple of times and my solution was to remove the back plate and make sure the charging contacts are fullyy engaged. In my specific case I have the charging pad mounted to the underside of my back plate not to the battery. Ive also bent the snout of the charging pad (where the contacts are located) away from the underside of the back plate so when mounting the back plate the contacts can line up better. This is not necessary if youve taped the charging plate to the battery. If youve taped the charging plate to the battery and your confident the charging contacts are fully engaged then I would look to the

I would only advise purchasing this item if you have experience in changing screens on tablets"

I have a screen protector on my phone. Will I have to take it off and leave my screen unprotected to use the case?,"No, the front is open but it is sealed around the edges.

Will this for the s4?,Phone calls were echoed... I will not purchase this case again.
Does this case interfere with the phone's NFC connectivity?,"Yes and no. Distancing the phone from the tag and having any form of barrier will decrease the range of the tag.

It is possible to attach a cord to the case to be able hang the cellphone in my neck?,No. I disagree with the previous answer...it's not the worst case ever. It's a pain to get open but I think that's the point. No dirt or water can get in if you can't.
Will it still be waterproof if I have a cracked screen?,"The case itself should continue protecting from water damage as long as the case is not damaged. I don't believe it would be fully waterproof with a cracked screen, but the case should come with a screen protector which will help protect your phone as well."
Does the phone overheat while in this case? Can you leave it in the case all the time?,No and yea
"How hard is this case to get on and off, because I regularly have to take the battery out and put a new one in due to my charging port being broken?","If you have to take it out daily, then I would say don't get it.

Will it slide nicely in the pockets?,Yes
Does this case protect the screen as well,"No, just the back and sides. It does extend up over the sides enough so that when you lay the phone face down the glass does not touch the surface."
is it a solid/ tough plastic or is it a silicon/ soft plastic,"It's bendable, twistable...but if I dig my nail in it, it doesn't leave an impression, which is why I have difficulty with the buttons on the phone but I've gotten used to it. It doesn't add bulk to the phone and for the price it works well. Hope this helps."
Does it come with a screen protector?,No it does not.
I wonder about the ease of using the side buttons. I'd like to hear both pros and cons.,Somtimes the -button hesitate a little but I think is my fault(comparing it with my xperia play case works far better)
Will this fit Lumia 521?,"No, Lumia 521 is slightly larger and some controls positions do not match."
"Is it made out of real leather, bonded leather or some sort of synthetic material?","It is made out of leather with a microfiber inner lining.

I am looking for a case that I can have a hard shell case on phone then carry in holster for S3 Galaxy mini. Will this product work?,Fits perfect for me but I have an S4 with defender case

What are the actually measurements of this case?,I don't have the dimensions but I wanted it to be a little big so I ordered it to fit a Samsung Galaxy S3 when my phone is a S2. The S3 is bigger than my phone. Better too big than too small.
Does it get in the way of your car's seat belts,"It depends on if you wear it on your belt or on your pocket. I wore it on my front left pocket and I either just let the belt rest over it, or sometimes I would slide the belt under it. If you wear it on your belt, it really shouldn't be an issue. I don't know if men's jeans fit higher up than women's, so that may make a difference if you wear it on your pocket also. I am obviously female. I hope that helps even just a little bit."
"My HTC One w/ Urban Armor case measures 5 11/16 x 3 x 5/8...Is the length exactly 5.5 or 5 1/2""? Need a belt looped runners case to add on HTC","It may be a little snug (lengthen wise) at first but it will stretch with repeated use. So far it has worked for my Samsung Galaxy 3 with a Case logic protective case which are very close to your measurements. FYI the ""bonus"" antenna extender did nothing for my Samsung Galaxy 3 and since the ""anti-radiation shield"" did not comes with clear enough instructions, it was a waste for me."

Thanks. What is difference to Maxboost Shell Holster on Amazon list $29.95 Sale $12.95?,"Looks like for an extra 3 dollars the belt clip/kickstand is much more versatile.

is that the HTC warranty work?,"For item purchased overseas, HTC manufacturer warranty not applied. We offer 1 year seller warranty, if there are any problem, you can send back to us for repair. Thanks."
Is it 3g let,I believe if its unlocked it is not I loved the phone but sent it back because since know carrier in the US has started carrying this phone I wouldn't recommend it until someone does but overall I loved the phone but they tell u because it's unlocked its like 2 G it is a great phone for the Asian and Europe market but wait for some us carrier to pick it up
the phone is unlocked?,Yes it is factory unlocked can work with any SIM card worldwide
What is their frequency response range? Data should be on specs sheet if product is reputable...,Thanks for your advice.:) The frequency response range is 90Hz-20kHz.
"Does an iPhone 4s have enough power to produce good volume enough to realize the bass feature? I'm looking for the best bass speaker, if possible.",Yes.
Is this speaker waterproof?,No
is this compatible with the iphone 5c as well?,"Yes, it works with any Bluetooth A2DP device, however I would not recommend it. I tested and thoroughly compared about 60 different Bluetooth speakers recently. The SHARKK Bluetooth 4.0 speaker is the best bang for your buck, period, and it has double the battery life they list because they upgraded the battery but didn't update the description. Though it's sound is a tad sharp, the Altec Lansing iMW575 speaker is the best waterproof one I've discovered. It's loud and clear but does start to distort at high volume when the battery gets very low, instead of just turning off. Maybe they fixed that with a firmware update. The best non-waterproof speaker hands-down is the Sound Blaster Roar SR20 and it really cranks out awesome, clear sound with sweet bass and amazing battery life. Speakers that support APT-X and AAC audio codecs have clear, uncompressed sound. Skip Bose, except for the Soundlink mini, which sounds very good but is a little soft. Most Bose is way overpriced. The Sony SRX-X7 is awesome but also overpriced and the software, if you choose to use it, is way overcomplicated and buggy."
Does it automatically shut off to save battery when either 1) audio is zero or 2) bluetooth connection is lost ? Some time delay until shut off is OK,"No it does neither of these functions, it would be nice. Great audio tho"
My Braven (3rd portable BT speakers set) has extremely-useful (occasionally...) AUDIO OUT 3.5mm audio jack: does this one...?,The package includes: Bluetooth Speaker*1; USB Changing Cable*1; 3.5mm Audio Cable*1; Manual*1; Carrying Bag*1
Would product provide ample sound and be beach friendly?,"Hi Gabriel, My truly sincere opinion: no. Quality of sound is so so at best. Best quality price in town : no contest it's the Sharkk boombox . Sound is great, loud , battery is great. So it help you . Thanks .Guy"
"Hi, I would like to know about the shipping destination. Can you ship to Cambodia?","Sorry, our products cannot be shipped to Cambodia. We only have 7 markets of Germany, UK, US, Spain, Italy, Japan and France. Some other Europian courtries also within delivery range."
Is this compatible with model SCH-R970C?,"I would compare the actual measurements; as long as it's close to the same size and the power port is in the same spot, it should work"
Is the phone NFC capable when the case is installed?,Don't waste your money charges really slow and not NFc capable
so after i charge the product and my phone ... i then put the phone in the case and the phone stays charged longer...Correct???,Yep
Is it compatible with model SCH-i545?,I don't have i545 phone so I do not an answer. S4
How would this charger work for Galaxy s5? Would you have to break off the cap at the bottom in order to plug in the case?,"Hi, not sure as have the S4."
does this work with samsung s4 GT-19500,Yes
Is this a good case?,I like it but it only will fully charge my phone when in standby. Which is fine if you don't use your phone while it's charging.
Is this a good case?,I do like this case. It charges the phone quickly and protects it. When my first one stopped working the company replaced it immediately. I didn't realize how much I depended on until I didn't have it.
so i charge the case then put my phone in it,That is the fastest way to charge both the phone and case. It will charge if you leave it in the case but it will charge slower that way
Will the work with a galaxy s4 Active?,I believe it only works with the regular S4.
"This might sound like a dumb question, but how does the case charge? I have the problem where my phone is not charging at all.","Make sure the pins are touching the two metal plates on the side of your phone - if they aren't touching or one of the pins is broken you might need a new case - I was able to repair mine with a small piece of paperclip when it broke and just replaced the broken pin with that, but the preferable thing would be just to get a new battery pack."
It does receive the energy from the dock's interface? Can I use it as a dock replacement?,Yes
dose this work for the c6602,Of course! It's the same phone in all the models.
Will this fix on the L36a model # C6606?,"Yes, it does."
does this battery case works with the sony xperia z1 C6903?,Not sure. I ordered the wrong one and returned it over mail and am still waiting almost a month later to receive my money back.
does this battery case works with the sony xperia z1 C6903?,"Sorry but I just bought this for a friend. Quality wise, I think this is pretty good."
Does this work with the Xperia Z (c6606),"Yes, works fine"
"is this formen or women, what is the size of the bracelet","For women mainly. The gap opens to a max of 1"" and the inside diameter from side-to-side is 2 5/8""."
can it be set for regular time. I seem to only get military time.............,"Yes you can set it the normal timing with the am and pm displayed, just check the manual its very easy. :)"
is it water proof? and how many meters can i have it from my mobile?,No its not waterproof and probably about 15 feet...it stops working from my bedroom to the next room over.. And is really for women. .I never use mine
will this work with the LG G2 and can I use my bluetooth headset with this bracelet,"It works with most phones as long you have bluetooth but you need to install a program called franklin bracelet in the app store and its totally free, but I have managed to connect it without the program but its better if you download it. As for the headset I dont think its possible, I havent tried it yet but if I have any updates i'll let you know :p trust me its worth getting it :) I hope that helps. Billy"
can you download music to this watch or just control it on your phone,No control. Just listen to music
Can i receive text messages? Can I adjust the size of the print?,"No text messages, just alerts of missed calls and mail. But make sure you have a phone that's compatible, because i basically wasted the $, getting the bracelet, because my phone doesn't support the app. So i have to get a knew phone, so i basically use it for music."
will it work with ipod?,iPhone - yes
Will it work for Iphones ?,Yes. Works with Android and iPhone.
does it vibarate to let you know you have an incoming call or text?,"Yes, for both."
what is your estimated delivery time?,"Hello, our normal time is between 7- 20 business days. If u place your order today or tomorrow we will ship it on Monday for sure as this is long weekend. We thank you for your interest in our products."
Will this fit iPhone 5s or just the 5?,"They are the same size, so it fits an iphone 5 & 5s."
Will this fit an iphone 5C?,I really don't know fits my iphone 5 great
what is your estimated delivery time?,"Dear friend, Thank you for asking,because we ship it from China,we will ship the item after the customer pay for it, it will take about 15-28 days to arrive America. Thank you so much, best wishes!"
"if I order 2 or more cases, does that reduce the shipping?","yes,if you buy one case the shipping is $4.49, if 2 or more reduce $0.99 is 3.5"
There must be an opening for headphones but where is it?,"The headphones stick out the bottom where you slide the phone in- so 1 skinny end is open, if that makes sense."
How's the build quality? The seams in the photos seem a bit crooked..,It's a very durable band. I am pretty hard on mine and have yet to bust a seam open.
"My forearm is about 6.5"". Does the band fit an arm that small?",Should fit fine.
There seems to be several color options but no way to choose them on this site. What color did people get? Is it just random?,They are currently in Black only. The colored MyBands you see on the website are samples. The order for the colored MyBands was placed and will be available to purchase in October. Thank you for your interest.
do you know maybe if a droid mini with otterbox case will fit in it? Thanks,I would say the phone itself would fit but not with the outterbox case. It literally holds just the iPhone 5 and that's it. And that's a snug fit at first. The droid mini should work but not with any case on it.
Is the phone compartment completely waterproof especially from sweat?,"It's sweat proof! I use mine while running with my dog and takes a dip in the pool everyday to cool off, water and sweat get all over it and nothing gets through."
Will this work with a Mophie case on an iPhone 5?,No. Didn't fit
Can you touch and control iphone from the screen ?,"Yes it works great like that. I used it for hands free during my work, since all communication is through text. I could see them and answer with one hand. Great but sweaty in the summer months."
Will this work with an Otterbox Defender case?,if you take the rubber part off it will. It's a tight squeeze but it will fit. I have the Otterbox Defender case also.
"If I am running in the rain, is my phone going to be protected?","Yes, it has a plastic cover that will protect your phone"
Would this case protect the front (screen) of the phone if dropped? It looks like there's a slightly-raised lip around the screen-side? Thanks!,Not as heavy duty as an OtterBox style case but will provide some impact protection. It does wrap around and cover the outer edge of the glass.
Does the Nokia wireless charging case if over this case?,"Dear Matthew L.,in answer to your question will the Nokia charging case fit over this one that I have no idea,but I do know that to answer your question to the best of my ability I placed it on my DT 900 charging plate which I brought for my Nokia Lumia 920 and haven't used since I got my 1520,so as soon as I placed it on charging began right away,so I say you don't need a case to go over this one since it works without another,hope this helps you in deciding what to do,have a blessed morning."
With the case on is the back camera exposed or is there a plastic clear cover over it? If exposed is it recessed a little bit? Thanks,The camera is exposed and is not recessed.
headphone,It has a good sized opening for a headphone.
"Does the part surrounding the camera bulge protect the camera or not? Some reviews say ""No"" and others say ""Yes"". Product image shown seems it does.","I would say it does not. If it does, its by a micro millimeter and in my book that's not good enough."
Can it work in Botswana?,"This coverage maps shows that Orange is a GSM carrier in Botswana, so it should work with an Orange sim card or other carrier with an international data package in the areas shown on the map in this link: http://www.orange.co.bw/mobile/coverage.php However, it looks like mostly 2G GPRS and EDGE data coverage is available, your tablet is backwards compatible to these data services, but it will be slooowww when it works. 3G is available in only a couple of areas according to the map. There may be other GSM carriers but coverage will be likely similar. Even if the service works, make sure to address the costs of using a regional or international data package from the provider before hand. This tablet uses the micro-sim size card, and they may sell local prepaid sim cards in the more populated areas in electronics/cell phone stores, maybe some grocery/convenience stores. The tablet can also connect to WiFi, hopefully there are some free and public hotspots somewhere."
can it work with T MOBILE ?,"Am using T-Mobile with my tab 3,make sure it's GSM assisted"
Does this work in the Bahamas (BTC) like a cellphone?,Yes
Can this phone use the 64GB Momrey card?,Yes it can. I am using the 64 GB in mine and it is perfectly working.
Is this tab have international warranty that can be valid in any country,"No international warranty at all, sold as-is"
Does it have camera flash?,"No, this model did not have a flash. I thought I would be OK without it, but I was amazed how often I wished it had one..."

How mou chspeed,"For me, it is fast enough for whatever thing you are doing"
it is compatible with OTG? Can I connect a pendrive or an external hard drive?,"I have a Sony 32G Microvault with a USB on one side and a micro USB on the other. I can download files from my desktop using the USB side of the microvault. I can then plug the microUSB into phone. The Office Suite Pro app allows me to view, work, and save, though I don't use that often. I don't know about pendrives."
will it work with a bluetooth?,"Dear Jessica, yes, it works Best regards."
How do I connect this with my iphone 6?,follow the Bluetooth pairing instructions for the head set and set you iPhone Bluetooth option on - things should pair up fairly easy.
how do I get the whisper headset to alert me of incoming calls from my contact list?,Mine does that automatically. I am using an Iphone 4S.
does it work with phones that arent Smart Phones,"It should work with all phones that have Bluetooth capability. However, it's been so long since I used a ""dumb"" phone I don't know if they are typically made with a Bluetooth capability or not. If it's a super cheap ""dumb"" phone, then I'd guess not as it cost money to add Bluetooth. You'll have to carefully read about the phone's capability to determine it if has it or not."
Does the Motorola Whisper come with any warranty?,Yes a 1 year warranty.
what ear bud and ear hook accessories are included in the package? Online shows several options included but none are mentioned in your description.,"one ear loop and i think 5 ear buds of several sizes are included. I do offer a strong bit of advice I learned a long time ago, go to a local shop that sells high quality hearing aids. bring your blue tooth headset and the ear buds with you. Pick a ear-bud that you wouldn't use I always choose too small of one for me to use. Tell them you want to get a custom earpiece like for a hearing aid. they will put a little piece of foam rubber in your ear and then inject over it into your ear canal a gel that will harden and then pull it out. If your headset has a tube like this one or a piece like many other brands that must rest against your cheek for the noise filtering to work that they understand the position that is REQUIRED for the Bluetooth headset to work properly. They send it with your ear gel off and you typically get it back at their office in about 72 hrs when you go back bring your phone and your bluetooth headset. Make sure you turn your volume way DOWN or it will be like a cartoon when something is loud and blows out the other ear. You will find out that the headset will have the best volume that you ever had and you will be able to jump up and down, you could even lay down and put your head on a pillow and it will stay on and in position! Hope this answer and additional info helps."
does this come with a charger,No
"Does the 300ft range include talking, or is it just in reference to playing music etc? Quality versus Range?","Hey Mike...I've never went as far as 300 feet, but it does have great range for both. It's the best bluetooth set I've ever had. Hope this helps. Billy"
What Bluetooth version is installed on this headset?,"A2DP 1.2, Hands Free (HFP), AVRCP 1.4, HFP 1.6 Bluetooth Technology 2 Version 3.0, Class 1 Range"
Does anyone know where to get replacement ear gels? Mine have gotten all loose,"Call Motorola and complain. They didn't have any, and we should tell them that they are not supporting their customer. I think other manufactures work, like Plan...what ever."
Have they fixed iPhone 6 compatibility issues?,They must have. I own an iPhone 6 plus and my Bluetooth works great. No problems whatsoever.
Do you sell replacement tips?,Replacement tips are not available at this time. Please contact Griffin Technology Customer Support if you are having any issues with your MouthStick Stylus.
Can I order replacement tips?,"No, but, if it breaks within the warranty period they will replace it for free"
"does this comes in other sizes? because a bigger one like 20"" would be great for me",Unfortunately the MouthStick Stylus is not available in other lengths.

PIAOPIAO fashion PU leather wallet credit card flip stand Case cover for Iphone 4 4g 4s (mint green) -- does this model has flowers showed in the pic?,"When I recieved it, there were no flowers. But I must tell you be careful. It's protective but there are no sections to insert cards!"
Are the flowers included on the front of all the cases?,Not on this one

Does the case close magnetically?,Yes it does.

Does this come with an actual stylus?,"Yes mine did. There is no wrist strap on the wristlet though, thought I'd mention that. Hope this helps!"
"Hello, wondering if this item is for the iPhone 4? Also, does this item come with the wristlet strap included?",this item is for iphone 4 and come with strap.thanks

Does this work with all S4 models? (i.e. Sprints S4 SPH-L720T model),Yes it will!
It works with S4 i9505?,"It should if it has the same plug in size from the charger. And if it does, I would highly recommend this portable charger. Its a little heavy but so far, it does it job. Quick charge too."

Does it work with my HTC Inspire 4G? How long it will run?,"Yes, it is. For the running time, I can say they are much better than the original 1600mAh battery, one of these 2450mAh batteries last all day most days, love it."
"if i used HDMI port for tv,Micro USB for charging &amp; regular USB port for game controller.Will all ports work at the same time?can someone test this?thx","Actually I finally was able to get it to work all at the same time. Follow these steps and you'll probably have success. 1) connect any USB device you want to use, IE keyboard/mouse/etc 2) connect the HDMI cable to the adapter but not to the tv/monitor. Alternatively you can connect to the monitor and not to the adapter. Either way don't connect it to the screen you want to use just yet. 3) connect YOUR charging cable directly from your wall-charger. The cable that was sent with the adapter to provide power must not be high enough quality to power everything and USB does not have enough 'umph' to do it either. 4) plug the adapter into your phone, verify that the phone has recognized your USB device(keyboard/mouse/etc). If not, start over from step 1. If you continue to have issues, your adapter may be defective. 5) now you can connect your HDMI cable to your screen. At first nothing will happen but within 3-5 seconds your phone's screen will turn off and your tv/monitor will turn on. hope this helped."
"Buying for my son, will this work with a Motorola Moto X phone? Thanks!",Don't bother. Bought it and could never get it to do anything. Took the $10 as a loss and avoid this OEM.
can you charge and use the other device's functions at the same time?,"So far yes, haven't had any problems. You have to plug charger into adapter first and then adapter into phone."
"So far, my adapter does a very good imitation of a lump of plastic.I have a Nexus 7 ver 2, a HTC vivid, and a Samsung s4 from ATT, no response from any not even a notice I had plugged it in, used power suppy at all times, tried sd card and USB...",Same thing happen to me.
"Is the HDMI video only, or does it also transmit audio as well?",it also transmit audio
Is this compatible with Mega Galaxy phone?,yes
Attaching cords to this device will place a LOT of strain on the connector to the phone. Can I use an 'extension cord' or will that prevent MHL? (e.g. will attaching a USB micro female to micro male extension cord between this device and the phone...,"I had the same concern, bought a 5 pin extension and it did not pick up the device. I'm using a Samsung S4 Active, so I've got a port cover that seriously gets in the way, especially when my case is on the phone. One workaround I've accidentally found is that the tent-shaped portion at the top of the device pops off rather easily and fits much better."
Does a USB Hub work on the USB port of this item?,"Yes, I have A USB hub that I used with a mouse, keyboard, and flash drive all at the same time."
Will it work on a Nexus 5 or Nexus 7 (2013) device? Im Interested but i wanna be sure if it's full compatible.,I do not know. The one I have doesn't work for mine
WILL THIS WORK WITH THE SAMSUNG NOTE 1 i717?,I'm not too sure about that...my guess is that it should. I just know for sure that it works with all the samsung galaxy phones.
Will this work with the LifeProof S4 FreCase?,"No Scott, and larger/extended batteries no...I actually returned this, it was defective. And purchased Samsung Galaxy Smart Dock Multimedia Hub...it will accommodate your case and do so much more...and I purchased the Caseology battery charger combo (since hub doesn't have extra charge ""station""...little more pricey...but well worth it...they latter two purchases are excellent! Hope this is helpful."
It is compatible with Samsung Galaxy SIII?,"The two phones are basically the size except the the Galaxy s4 is slightly thinner than the Galaxy s3. The port for the mini-usb is in the middle so the charger should accommadate the S3, and the only difference in the batteries is that the s3 battery is also slightly thinner than the s4 in width and will work in either phone, the s3 battery should be easier to fit in the back charging slot of the desktop unit, as the s4 is albeit tight, but does charge."
Can I use my car charger cord connected to this charger while driving to charge the battery?,I don't see why not.
sorry but I am educated in batteries. I have a Samsung 2600 mAh battery. Is that the one I am to use? No light comes on when I put it in the slot.,light on mine went out I returned it as defective ---mine only worked for a couple of hours
If i keep it on though the night will it stop charging when it is fully charged,Yes
Does the plug make a noise when you take your phone off the charger?,No it does not
I know this doesn't work with the defender case on. is there a cradle charger that will work with the case on ?,"I don't know. That is a problem that you must research yourself. I do not have a defender case and have never used one. But I do know that if you take your Samasung Galaxy S4 phone out of the case, this cradle charger will work just fine. After all, you must remove the phone to change batteries...."
Does this come with an AC wall adapter? I do not want to plug it into my computer to charge.,No it doesnt. I had a few phone usb adapters i didnt need one.
Will this unit also fit samsung galaxy s5 ACTIVE,I dont believe it will. The Galaxy S5 uses a USB 3.0 connection for faster data transfer. The Galaxy S5 Active i understand still uses the USB 2.0 connection.
which way does the spare battery sit in charger?,"Look at the top of the battery - Line up the ""+"" , ""-"" on the top upper left edge. And notice the brass contacts on the top. If your facing the charger, the black contacts on the charger are on the right side. Black to brass and your good to go. Hope this helps. In case your charger is black, look for the two little pins inside the battery slot."
Does this have a camera hole?,Yes it does.
How hard or soft is this case? The back makes it look like a central hard plastic bit to hold the case on.,"It's all soft silicone - that part is just smooth and not ""pebbled"" like the rest of the case..."
Does this product work for the second generation Nexus 7,"Hey, Donald! Yes, this case is specifically made for the Nexus 7 2nd Gen tablet."
My Nexus 7 Full HD is considerably thinner then my older Nexus 7. Will this cover fit?,"Fits my gen 2013 Nexus just perfect, so if there's any size difference (sorry unfamiliar with your model) it may not fit right. Hope this helps."
"What is the difference between the Fredom Sprint and the X Sport? For running outside - 5 minles or so, and in the gym, which would you recommend?","I have owned both pairs in the past 3 months and myself as well as my roomate like how the freedom sprint fits better in our ears. With that being said it may just mean we need to play with the attachments more. However alot of customer reviews on the apple website also state they don't fit their ears as well either. The bluebuds X are a little bigger outward and their center of gravity is outward more and thus they seem to want to fall out of your ear even when oriented in the secure fit orientation. The freedom sprint have two options to fit in the over ear position or inner ear and bluebuds x only fit inner ear style. The secure fit orientation is nice, but IMO it takes way too much adjustment to get it right as I still can't find that sweet spot. Pros: Bluebud X sound is great if you can get it to fit and stay. Also the secure fit gets the cord off your neck which is way better than sticking to your neck when you get sweaty. Cons: Bluebud X is smaller in size, but sticks out too far and may cause ear buds to fall out easier beacause of that. Some people don't like the way they fit in your ear. I'd say freedom sprint in terms of cost and ease of use."
Do these headphones have a built in Mic?,Yes they are amazing
What is the range of the bluetooth for this headset? Does it really have to be on your body as stated in one of the reviews?,It depends. I generally set mine on the ground in the gym. Best works if in your pocket. But works well enough within about 5 ft.
Do they turn off automagically?,No. You have to manually turn them off by holding down the power button for 8 seconds.
what is included in the packaging?,"I returned mine because they were low volume n didn't stay on my ear well especially with the wire connecting. Anyway, I think it came with the headset, a hard case, 3 different sizes of the the tips the go inside your ear, 3 different sizes of the flaps that balance the headset in your ear, 1 set of removable clips to go around your ear during heavy movement, and a charger. I don't remember anything else being in the package. I'm not sure if the charger was just the USB cable or if it also included the unit that plugs into the wall."
"What does it mean by ""Retail Packaging""? Does this come with the little case like when you buy from the Apple Store?",It just means that it's the actual packaging you'd find it at a store.
Do they fall of your ear while running fast??,Yes they will. They fall out at the gym. Go for beats
this ones or the pantronics backbeat go 2?????????? wich one is better?,I wouldn't recommend any of their products. Go Bose.
It's water resistant?,It claims to be sweat resistant. There is a small door on one ear piece which covers up the micro hdmi charging port. I think you'd have to immerse the headset in water to short it out.
these work with bluetooth headphones for tv and films to see imac ??,"Yes, they do within a certain range... I think is around 12 or 18 feet... Great sound and other built in functions..."
How protective is this case? Does it have much protective cushioning or is it mostly plastic?,"Corners, top, bottom and inside of case is a rubber material. The middle 80% is a hard plastic (blue) but almost resembles metal. I think the case protects the phone pretty well. It does not protect the face in anyway but I bought screen protectors for that. It does come with one screen protector but I wanted more and installed the other not the one with the case, no particular reason thats just how it happened. Hopefully this helps, it is a good value IMO and I have paid more for lesser cases that is for sure."
Does it come with a screen protector?,Yes
Will this case actually fit the new iphone 5C? Regular iphone 5 and 5S are are different and 5C phones will not fit in their cases. Making sure you actually have one that fits the 5C. Thank you!,"Yes, it fits my 5C perfectly."
Just received my Obliq case in the mail. It does not fit my iPhone 5c at all. Do you know why this may be?,"The only thing I can say is that maybe it is the wrong case, as my fits perfectly! I would contact the seller for an exchange."
Where is the kickstand card stored when not in use?,"Nowhere to put it... It's just a cardboard card, imagine a credit card, so I guess you can put it in your pocket or wallet?.. I have given up on trying to use the ""stand"""
will this work with a glass screen protector,It will work. I have one and it works just fine
Does this case go well with the green iphone 5c?,Yes works great!
Is the color the same as in the picture?,"Yes, it is that same color as long as your monitor is correctly adjusted."
Would this be a good color to pair with the Pink 5C? Or should I choose the Pink case? Or Which other color?,I would go with the punk case...It would give it the cotten candy affect
Where is the card stored that serves as a kickstand and will it stand in vertical position?,You insert the card at the little open space at the back. The card only goes in a little bit but it stays in . Hope that helps
fit for iphone 5c,It says for the iPhone 5C so it should fit it.
Is the case one piece or 2 pieces?,"It's 2, and they fit awesomely. This pic Amazon is showing me is not exactly my Oblique case--I have no kickstand--but the cases totally rock. I'm PICKY!:)"
Does it rise over the screen so the screen is protected?,No it does not but it comes with a screen protector you can put on top
Does it have rubber edges so it doesn't slide so easily?,The edges are hard plastic NOT RUBBER.
All reviews for this case seem to be regarding the Samsung S4. Has anyone tried it on an iPhone 5C?,"Sorry, my wife and I only have the Samsung S4"
"Anybody know if this case is compatilble with the AmazonBasics USB Lightning cable http://www.amazon.com/dp/B009SYZ8OC/r... The body on the lightning end is a bit bigger than the Apple Lightning cable is,",Looks like it should work..the opening is quite a bit larger than the receptacle area.
Does this fit the Verizon iphone 5c,Yes

Which case is more durable - the Obliq or the Speck?,"while both are durable, The Obliq is more so. The hard shell speck cases I have had are very rigid and prone to cracking with impact or age. While the Obliq is still durable, it is slightly more rubbery in its movement so it will not only protect the phone but will act a shock absorber if you happen to drop it."
does it come with screen protector,Yes
dose it come with the black part the rubber part too???,"Mine was for the S4 and the case is dual layer. There is the black tpu rubber like case that goes on the phone then the harder outer shell. Mine was very quality. Feels excellent with a great fit. Doesn't come off easy but isn't difficult for me to take off. The buttons for mine aren't stiff but they feel secure and have stopped me from accidentally turning the power on many times which I was prone to do. So, I like the buttons. Mine was specifically made for the S4. You've probably noticed but on Amazon there is a box for picking which phone you have. My case also feels nice. The material seems quality. For the money I couldn't ask for better. I know everyone has different tastes but I was pleasantly surprised. Hope this helps!"
can I use a screen protector with this one,Yes!!!! There is no screen protection with this case.
Will it fit the iphone 5 c latest version and will the color match the pink iphone5c?,"yes, the case fits perfectly.. but im sorry i dont know about the color part i got the gray one, but if it helps it is the same color as the picture shows :)"
Does the 5c case fit a 5S?,No it does not. 5C is rounder than the 5S
Is this pink the same color as the pink iphone 5c?,It is dark orange color.
Does the case come up above the front face of the phone on the 5c like the otterbox cases to protect the phone from a face down drop?,Yes mine does
"Considering this for my 5c - it seems to match the ""pink"" well. My question is does this have a rubber/silicone inside? I want something cushioned.",The entire case is soft in feel from out as well as inside. I do not think it will impact your phone from inside. There is no cushion but it gives good protection to the phone. I dropped it couple of times and there is no issue. But I am using this for my Samsung S4. So I hope that for 5C it is the same.
Did the 5C case protect your phone well?,"I have the obig case on my galaxy s4-- It is rugged, looks good and it's a good deal. I liked it so much that I'm looking for an Obiq case for my Kindle- unfortunately the don't make one :-("
When will the purple be in stock?,"Soon, go to mygsmstore com and send us a message, once we get it we will notify you. Thanks"
"Another question actually Camera 13.0 MP, LED, 16X, 1080p, 2.2 MP 1080p?",Yes it is you can also review the features on amazon or on Google if you type the model number of the phone
Is This The Google Play Edition?,"No, this is not the GPE"
what Carrier would be used for this phone?,"any GSM carrier would suffice...at&t, t-mobile, straight talk, ect..."
Is this unlocked phone?,Yes. This is unlocked phone.
What is the size of xperia z ultra?,"the screen is 6.4"""
It comes in a new sealed box?,Yes
Is it a KIT KAT 4.4.4?,Mine actually updated to Android 5.02 a couple of days ago.
"when you say international, what exactly does that mean? I have metro pcs, which runs on T-Mobile. They said that the phone will run on their network","International means the GSM system, which is the US is T-mobile and ATT. It won't work on Sprint or Verizon."
does this phone support t-moible,Yes... You'll just need to put your Sim in and change the apn settings
How can I use two Melody wireless speakers as left and right speakers for stereo separation?,Thanks for your question. This speaker does not have that capability. They are only one-point-stereo each. This is a fantastic sounding speaker. World Wide Stereo is 35 years old and a very proud Soundcast dealer.
Can the melody fits in a regular size backpac?,"Hello KAF and thank you for your inquiry. The Melody measures aproximatly 8"" x 8"" x 10"". I checked it with my backpack that I use for my computer and it was too big? I believe you can find a back pack that this would fit it but don't know if I'd call it regular size? We're here to help so please let us know if you have any additional questions! Thanks again, Scott G and the rest of the ListenUp.com sales team"
"Does it have a built in amplifier? If so, how loud does it get outdoors?",Thanks for your question. There is a built in amplifier. This gets very loud outside. This is a fantastic sounding speaker. World Wide Stereo is 35 years old and a very proud Soundcast dealer.
Is it possible to run the soundcast melody with a power cord or only the internal battery?,"It has a USB AC charger included which could be plugged in while playing. The battery lasts so long and charges in a couple hours, I've never had to run it from the ac adapter."
Can anyone give an accurate estimate as to what the real world battery life is when played at close to full blast?,"I had the thing on a medium volume on Saturday, and it wasn't even on a full charge and it was still going when i brought the speaker inside 7-8 hours later. I use it all the time and have yet to use it for enough time for the battery to run out. Amazing battery life."
what do I add in order to get a range of 60-70 feet?,"I am able to get a range of around 50ft ""line of sight"" and about 20 ft indoors with walls."
what do I add in order to get a range of 60-70 feet?,I'm afraid I don't know as I haven't had to extend range of speaker beyond just a few feet from my source.
"We just got our Melody. Does anyone else have issues with the sound ""skipping"" when first connected to a device, or""clipping"" at the higher volumes.",I have had this be an issue with some of my streaming music services. The issue apparently was with them as they released patches to fix that. I would connect it with the cord and see if you have the same issues. It might just be interference of the Bluetooth signal etc.
How does this compare to the klipsch kmc 3?,Having never heard the kitsch I am unsure however I can tell you I bought a dozen soundcast Melody units due to positive reviews and everyone raves still about them.
Internally how many speakers this device is made up of? I listened to the music. I have some concerns on the sound quality. Can we adjust bass?,I don't know how many individual speakers it has. Cannot adjust bass. It sounds great.
Really can i use my s4 underwater with that case?? according with the product description said that against water immersion up to 1 mete,I took my phone with me to the beach and accidentally brought it in the ocean with me 30 minutes later I realized it was there and it was still working perfectly. The case does its job

Does it have a screen protector?,"Hello, Thank you for contacting us. Unfortunately, this item does not have a screen protector. Hope this helps!"
will phone fit in Holster for Casio G'zOne GZ1 Commando 2 4G LTE C811 in Black while having this case on,"probably too tight - better to have the cover and get another holster. I don't think the ""snap in"" variety will accommodate a cover. The pouch type would be better and more secure"
"Does this case go directly over the phone? Sorry to ask, just not sure. Also if purchasing more items will you combine shipping? Thank you!","Hi Kelly, yes this item goes directly over the phone. Sorry we don't offer combine shipping, shipping and handling cost is per item"
"will this fit into the oem clip,inward facing type ??",I never got the OEM clip. I know if you have the charging dock you will have to take this cover on and off every time. So you know there is jet out on the back of the cover near the battery.
Please please tell me this now gets 3G or 4G with T-Mobile for I see both the 1700 and 2100 bands now listed. I don't want the phone if it gets edge.,I have this phone. I use tmobile in oklahoma city. Its not edge. I get hsdpa+ and my download speeds reach 12mbps down and about 3mbps up. I love it. Mms works fast and perfect also.
Is it unlocked ?,Yes it's unlocked.
how much memory does it have?,16gb but expandable up 64gb
Is there a warranty?,No if you can wait for the att one is conningsoon
can this be worn under shirt?,Not unless the shirt is very large and untucked. The pouch on the side hangs down close to the beltline and would be very uncomfortable under a tucked in shirt. Think jacket rather than shirt.
Will an iPad air fit?,"The only tablet can fit is abt 6 to 8""."
"would a 8.8"" x 5.0"" tablet fit?",An. iPhone fits. Snugly with an extra pocket for something small with a small pocket that zips . I weAr it all the time
what is the chest size?,the chest is adjustable.I have a size 40. hwst and I have had to tighten it
it is suitable for an ipad mini?,"Yes, it is suitable for an ipad mini."
How deep is the pockets? Is this suitable for a Samsung S3 phone?,"Dear friend, Packing size: 24.00cm x 25.50cm x 2.00cm (9.46in x 10.05in x 0.79in) It suitable for a Samsung S3 phone. Thank you. Eliconn"
"My phone slipped off my lap and fell on the ground, but the screen cracked and spider webbed even with this case. Any suggestions for other cases?","I know that otterbox started to put out a line of cases for the Moto X, you might want to look at one of those."
Is the back rounded? Is any of the screen covered? Does it allow the Moto X to be stood up on the edge for viewing videos?,"Yes, no, and yes it stands up on its side in a very stable manner when set on a flat surface with glass being the most ideal."
How much thicker does this make your phone?,"This is very thin but durable case, adds very little to the size. I had an Otterbox on my old phone, but took it off after a while, too bulky. This is just perfect to help survive a fall and still get in and out of a pocket. Beware the instructions for installing the screen protector: DO NOT USE THE INCLUDED CLOTH ON THE ADHESIVE SIDE OF THE PROTECTOR. I DID, NOW THE PROTECTOR IS TRASHED!"
I am hoping this is for moto x 1st gen. is it?,Yes
is this a bulky case or is i on the slimmer side ?,I wouldn't call it bulky. It's adds a bit around the edges of the phone. It was comfortable in my hand.
Can you plug in headphones to the headphone jack without problem? I don't want to have to take off the case to listen to music.,"yes, you can plug it without problem (don't need take off the case)"
Can this fit moto x developers edition? this one:http://www.amazon.com/motorola-mo...,"Yes, there is no difference between the physical measurements of the two phones, only internal and software differences. It will fit."
Is this for the Moto X 1st gen (2013)?,Yes
What is the texture of the solid plastic back? Is it completely smooth/glossy or does it have a rough-ish finish on it?,"The back has a slight, very slight, texture. Enough to allow some grip. The outside perimeter looks exactly as the back, but has more grip/texture and feels more rubber-like. If you look at a close up, there is a glossy border around the outside. But, the rest has texture. The raised portion around the outside complements the texture, adding to the grip-ability."
How much protection does this offer and is any part of this case rubber/silicone?,"If you're going for max protection, this wouldn't be your best bet. It's better than not having a case, but there are other cases out there that would offer more (Like any of the Ballistic cases.) There are no rubber/silicone bits. It's all hard."
How thin is this? Does it add much bulk to the phone?,It doesn't add bulk to the phone it's actually pretty thin and light.
"How much does the frosted back obscure the color of the back? If I've got a wood back on my Moto X, will it be hard to see?",It obscures it pretty well. My navy back just looks vaugely blue but mostly black brighter colors will show more but you definitely aren't going to see the gain of the wood super clearly especially If its ebony.
Does anyone else have any issues with taking pictures in the dark with the case on? There seems to be some glare associated and the pictures are bad?,I haven't noticed any issues with that.
Is the case ACTUALLY clear? Not frost?,"It's frost. I got a custom Black front/White Back with Orange accents Moto X, hoping to see White back clearly like a TPU case. It makes your back look dimmer or dingy, with camera clearly open & showing your phone's color. The case is very good, even keeping the dimple, but the back description is misleading. Definitely NOT ACTUALLY clear."
"Does the frost add any texture to the back? Also, what is the texture of the colored side area. Does it feel like silicone or hard plastic?","The center frosted section is smooth with no additional texture, however grip is greatly improved by the surrounding material. The side area is semi-hard and gives great added feel and grip to the phone. I love it. The case has a great snug fit and still lets the phone fit comfortably in a pocket without added bulk."
"I just got this &amp; really like it, but side buttons are VERY difficult to get to work. Anyone else have this issue, or does it ""break in?"" Defective?",I haven't had any issues with the buttons. Mine are placed perfectly!
is this for the first gen (2013) moto x? thanks.,Yes 1st gen.
Is the back of this case very rounded or flat? I am trying to use along side an adhesive card holder,It has a bit of a cruve to
does it work with the new moto x recently relased (sept 20140 and how do i get to make color choice?,"No, the hav diferentes fitness"
does the red and black case look cool?,"It does, but orange and black are classic Harley Davidson colors and would be popular with those looking for a cheaper alternative to a Harley Davidson overpriced case."
Can you easily get the screen protector off and replace with a new one directly attached to the 1020?,"No, it is NOT removeable. But it does work rather well. Touch commands and all. Makes it abit bulky but will do the job intended. Hope that helps. I'd replace it in a minute if needed."
Would this case fit a Lumia 1520?,No. The 1520 is significantly larger than the 1020... sorry.
need case for 1320 nokia,pretty sure
does the otter box case cover the speaker on bottom of phone ?,"No, it does not cover the speaker on the bottom. There is a flap that allows you to close over the charger plug, but the speaker remains open and unhindered"
Is it waterproof,Not waterproof but great protection! Totally recommend
Does this fit the Nokia Lumia 1020 unlocked GSM version?,Yes
Does the warranty apply to these otterboxes as they do on the official otterbox website?,"Yes, the Otterbox warranty applies to this case too. There is a official Otterbox Limited Warranty card included in the ATT packaging."
This also covers the case of the rear camera?,Nope
does it come with the built-in screen protector?,"Yes. I covers everything from except the common stuff (i.e. front-facing camera, light sensor, etc... makes it soooooo much easier to wipe off fingerprints."
What size arm would a S/M vs a M/L fit?,"I got a small and I am 5'3"" 110 lb woman. It fits great."
is it easy to control your music player with this armband?,It's not as easy as some other arm bands I've used. The home button for the iPhone 5 falls slightly below the frame of the armband and the plastic is quite thick (good for protecting against rain though).
Is it possible to wash it in the washer?and after how could I dry it?,I do not think so
Would this fit an iPhone 5S in a Lifeproof case?,Haven't tried but might be really tight or not fit at all. The iphone4 in a LIFEPROOF case fits just right and leaves only about a quarter inch of space at the top.
I have an Armor Series by Otterbox iPhone 5s cover....will this case fit it?,It's tight but it will fit. I have same phone and same Otterbox. Only issue I had was that I had to punch a hole in the bottom for the earbuds cord connection. I use it for running and it's fine.
Hi! Which is the maximum circumference of arm that can cover?,"I would say 18"" comfortably with a solid bite of the velcro flap."
Does anyone know the inside measurements of S/M and M/L?,"S/M fits arm size 8.5"" - 11"". Size M/L fits arm size 11"" - 16"" The gray tab is pretty rigid, so I there's not any play beyond that, but they do have an extender you can get from their website if you need one."
Does this fit an iPhone 6?,I would say it will not fit the iPhone 6 model. My 5s fit perfectly while still in the commuter series Otterbox case but I got a new case (the defender series) and I have to take the outer layer off in order for it to fit in this arm band. Aside from that it's great. Well put together. Hope that helps!
is it waterproof,I have worn it in the rain (in Seattle no less) and it does keep my phone dry. I doubt it could survive submersion in a body of water though
Will the Samsung Galaxy S5 with an Otterbox Defender case fit in it?,Unfortunately no. But we do have an armband called a V1xl that fits the S5
does this armband hold a iphone 4s with a lifeproof case,Yes it does
will the iPhone 5s with life proof case fit,"Yes, with room to spare."
What are the dimensions of the smart phone storage area?,I'm not sure the exact dimensions but I have an iPhone 5s and with the otter box case it doesn't fit into this.
Does this case have a hole at the bottom for the headphone plug of an iPhone 5S?,"Yes, it has a hole at the bottom - it's really hard to get to, though - you kind of have to weave it into the case. It makes it really difficult to get the jack in & out and make any adjustments. I bought some cheap bluetooth headphones from living social, which work well, and I now only hardwire in the headphones when I forget to charge the other ones."
Is this case usable with the iPhone 4 lifeproof case and if so what size. Also is it waterproof. Can I swim with it.,I have an iPhone 5 with an otter box and it fits. The case is nylon with a zipper opening so you definitely cannot swim with it.
What are the inches this band can wrap around on your arm? I'd like pink but I don't know the dimensions the band would surround before I purchase.,I believe it is 11 inches. I saw it somewhere before I ordered it. My arm is 12.5 inches and without the extension it is snug. You may find the information on Sporteer website or contact there customer service for more information. Their customer service is excellant!!
Is the opening smaller on the S/M model?,"I don't have anything to compare it to as never saw the other models, but that would be my assumption."
Will this fit the iphone 5s with the otterbox defender case?,Yes. I use it with an Otterbox Defender case. It fits nicely.
Will it fit an HTC one?,"I'm sorry, I honestly don't know."
what is the difference between bulk packaged and retail packaged plantronics headset?,"""Bulk packaged"" is in fact refurbished. The headset includes a 90-day limited warranty issued by a third party warranty services company specifically for refurbished products. The retail version is brand new and includes a one-year warranty directly from Plantronics. I purchased both a retail version and the bulk version through Amazon at the same time. Examining both units, I also noticed a few small scratches and gouges on the bulk version where the two halves come together, presumably the result of being pried apart to repair the unit. There's nothing wrong with selling refurbished products, but they should be labeled as such. These are being presented as ""new"" and that is misleading, basically bait and switch."
"My issue is the earpiece, all of them are round these days and dont fit my tiny ear. I cant see the earpiece, is it the kind that sits down in the ear and not the silly round ear bud option that is uncomfortable?",Go to this website - http://the-gadgeteer.com/2011/12/14/plantronics-m50-review/ Scroll down the page - there is a photo of the back of the earpiece.
"Why can't I pair my headset with my smart phone? To elaborate, my bluetooth setting on my phone is on. It is in discovery mode. I am searching for the nearby bluetooth devices and nothing can be found. The bluetooth is on and fully charged. I've got...","Hi, Try this: First make sure that the bluetooth headset is OFF. Then When the bluetooth is off. try pressing the middle button and keep holding it. first the light will turn on flashing. keep ur finger pressed even after that. after like 5-10 more seconds it should become a flashing red & blue light then try to pair it with the cell phone. If your phone asks you for a passcode then enter fours zeros (0000). Let me know how it goes. Thanks... Isaac @ BluetoothPlus"
"If I buy the bulk packaged item, will I still get the instructions with it? It is going to be a gift for my daughter.","Yes, there is a short instruction sheet included. It's enough info to pair up and start a conversation!"
Does it work with PC or laptops?,STeve I Use It With My Tablet So I assume It Would With PC Or Laptop
android,"Android what? Does it work? Ok android? Absolutely, works on my Galaxy S3 phone and on my Galaxy Note 8 tablet with no problems"
Can this unit be used for iphone 5 ?,I don't see why it would not work with the iPhone
"The picture shows right-ear. Can over-ear-piece be switched, so you can wear it in your left ear?",Yes. You can switch ears easily. I do it all the time.
is this bluetooth compatible with LG A340 phone,It should be is working fine with mine
does this work with a Nokia Lumia 820?,"Yes it does, I have had 3 of these excellent bluetooths and will continue to repurchase them as I lose them ocassionaly"
"Is the back side/design a rubberized material? I use mine for GPS frequently, and I can't have the phone slipping out of my hand. Thanks.","Dropped my phone many times and the case has protected it. BTW - due to the case's very tight fit, I had to cut away the material at the bottom in order for the charger cord to fit properly. Many years ago I purchased a case from Ballistic for my iPhone 4S which I use for work now. It is a much higher quality case - no modifications needed with extra protection on sides, front, & edges than this one. However, it was several years ago at a time when there were very few options. I enjoy the design very much and was willing to try it. No regrets! Hope this helps your decision-making."
Would this model fit an iphone 5?,Yes this case fits my 5s perfectly. I have dropped my phone several times & had no damage. I would recommend this case for an iPhone 5 or 5 s.
"Is ""iphone"" and the smaller words under actually printed on the back of the case or is it just in the photo?",Hi. They are actually a part of the design so they will show up on the case. Thanks
"Is this the ""tough case"" version or the""slim snap-on"" version?",Hi.. This is the tough case version. Thanks
how does this case do for drop protection?,"The one I got was broken on arrival, the plastic way too hard and brittle. They sent me a new one at no charge, made of much softer plastic. Works perfectly. Also a rooCase, but not the same model."
which model is it that has a softer better plastic?,"I'm sorry, but I don't know... I got the gloss yellow and blue, but I think that matte finish may be a little better. No evidence to back that up since I haven't seen or had the opportunity to have any contact with the matte bumpers, but that is my thoughts on that. Sorry I can't be of more help. :-/"
Does this case come also cover the back of the phone?,"Yes, it covers the back and sides of the phone."
Will this fit an iPhone 5 or just the 5C?,"Hello, Thank you for your email. This case will on ly fit the Iphone 5c. I hope this helps! Feel free to let me know if you have any further questions.

Does this fit an Apple Ipod 4?,"It fits my 4g like a glove. Unless you are a skankee fan, then you will want to buy something else!"
will it fit the android razor ?,"Not to my knowledge, it fits my iPhone 4S. I get many compliments on it though."
pls explain the two pieces,Fits the iPhone perfectly. Just like any protector. Both pieces fit together. My husband loves it!
pls explain the two pieces,The grey part in my case is silicon ( I have the Yankees case that's why it's grey.) The part with the team logo is a hard layer. I hope this helps
does this fit in a snap in belt clip,"I'm sorry, but I can't answer that question. I'm sure it would depend on the belt clip. For what it's worth, I have found that belt clips tend to be made for a specific cover these days and most are not compatible with other covers. Try reviewing this on google and see if there are others out there that have reviewed for this specific question."
Does this have the screen shield?,No it does not
"For the Iphone 5s, does this cover allow you to utilize the fingerprint technology to unlock your phone from the home button?",Sorry it was a present. I dont know.
Can you get this same case for a Samsung galaxy s4,"Hello, the closet is: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00E91WI6K"

Does it fit the 5c iPhone?,"No, the 5c has a slightly larger body and the buttons are different (rectangles for the volume instead of circles) so this case will not fit the 5c."
Why am I not seeing a model listed for 32gb? I'm only seeing 16gb sold from Motorola.,"The stock black or white devices are only available in 16 GB versions. If you want to upgrade to 32, you would have to order a customized device via Motorola.com."
Does this phone have an SD slot?,"Hi Ted, Unfortunately this model doesn't comes with SD slot, it's something I still don't understand why. Though mine came with 1 year free Dropbox included. I got many apps and songs and still have 3gb memory free. Is up to you how much memory you need to use."
I am asking about the one sold by amazon.com ($299) is the color black or woven black (carbon fiber like) like we usually see on other moto x ?,Carbon fiber like
Does anyone know what 4g Lte Bands is this phone available? It would be truly helpful. Thanks!,4G LTE bands (GSM Unlocked model only) 700/AWS/1900MHz (B17/B4/B2)

Has anyone had any experience with these in regular outdoor use in the rain? I want to use them on my bike but am afraid that rain might ruin them.,I haven't used mine in the rain but I sweat quite a bit when riding my bike here in Texas and haven't had any troubles. These bluetooth headphones are probably the best ones of probably that I've owned and I've had probably a dozen or more brands and types.
"do they play music too, or are they just for calls?",They play whatever is on the Bluetooth device you are using. If connected to your iPhone they will play your iTunes and then mute the music if a call comes in and return to iTunes when you hang up from the call.
"Do these work in a high noise environment (I'm thinking lawn mower). I use in ear buds, now, and they get wet and tend to slip, at least partially...","i go running with mine. i sweat a lot. no problems with slippage. also, i've thrown in ear plugs and used these things while operating a jackhammer. pretty nice to have something interesting (Darn Carlin's Hardcore History) to listen to while working."
"How are they for talking on the phone on a car? I drive a fairly noisy vehicle, so I need good noise cancellation at the microphone.",I have been told by people I have spoken with that they have very good noise reduction filters when using the phone.
How do people with Glasses feel wearing this?,"I wear glasses, and while it does take some adjustment, it works out fine for me. I found the best results by raising the temples of my glasses a bit so that the arms of the Bluez rest just under them. It shouldn't affect your vision nor the conduction of sound. It will take a bit of playing around. I really enjoy mine."
have they improved the performance?,"Hi James, I was never really satisfied with their performance and eventually gave them away."
i have a iphone 5s does siri work with this and wich button do i press and hold?????,"hi, yes siri will work. Press and hold the phone button for 2-3 seconds on your left ear, until you hear voice dial"
"Are the speaker pods significantly thicker than on wired versions? I use for sleeping on my side and the wired version is OK, but wires are a pain.","I don't have the wired versions to compare. On my set, the speaker pads, measuring from the outside edge of the plastic shell to the outside edge of the pad, I get about 1.2cm for the front-facing side and 1.5cm for the widest part of the back-facing side. (Back facing side tapers.)"
Does it work only wireless? could I plug it to any device to use it without bluetooth service?,"It's wireless only; sadly, there is no wired option."
"I've got a big fat head, any chance these will fit?",Probably I wear an extra large bike helmet and works for me. May be a little stretched and not so comfortable. Ask manufacturer to be sure.
Has anyone used this case with the VicTsing Black Magnetic Charging Dock? http://www.amazon.com/VicTsing-Magnet...,"I use the sony official dock, but I can tell you the problem I faced since they have a similar build (unless you get the one with the case holder, which I wasn't willing to try). The charging side of this case comes up way to far, so I had to trim the case back about a inch, wasn't really hard few swipes with a exacto knife and i was able to cleanly snap it off.The real problem with the case is the weight, it tends to pull the phone backwards, so i have to position the case correctly to use the dock, it sounds more of a hassle than it actually is.

We have Iphones and it charges those.It also charges my gf I pad and the kindle fires the kids have and my e pad. It does not charge my Play station 3 controllers.

can you plug it into 220v with an adapter?,"Sure; the device is rated at 120/240 V. Have the correct adapter and your all set. The only issue could be your device if it isn't happy with the slightly different output wattage. But, not too likely to be an issue with modern devices."

"How secure is it hanging, like from a carabiner. I almost never have my keys in a pocket so im wondering how well it takes abuse.",The cap really locks on so it should hang very well from a carabiner. It is as cool as it sounds. Thanks for asking.
Im concerned that the lightning tip does not have a protective cap or something to protect it? does it bring one?,I've had mine a few months on my key ring and I haven't seen a need for protective cap. Mine still works perfect and there's been no damage to the lightning connector.

I am unable to get this device to charge an Iphone 5 or 6.Any hints?,I had the exact same problem and I returned the product. It says it will charge IPhone 5 and 6 but mine did not work.
Will this charge the new Iphone 6 Plus which requires more power and IPad Air 2?,"I don't know. I have the iPhone 5s, and it charges this just fine. Remember, this is a small cable meant for using when you forget, or don't have your normal cable; it isn't meant for using as a replacement. According to the Apple website, all of the new lightning cables are compatible with all of the new products, so it should be compatible with your iPad Air 2. The cost isn't much, which is why I decided to take a chance and bought it, and I wasn't disappointed. It is a very good cable."
I see it can be used on Consumer Cellular. Does it have 3G/4G capability? Can battery be changed?,"Yes, Barb, it does have 3G/4G capability. And the battery can be replaced. My first battery didn't last very long (5 months) but was able to purchase another from Amazon and it worked perfectly."
Will this phone work with Consumer Cellular phone service?,Yes. That is what I use with it.

what is the range on these?,Around 32 ft
What is the battery life for playing music?,4 to 5 hours
What are the details of the sound quality: Is the bass decent? Is the treble clear?,The sound quality is good. I'm not an earbud connesieur by any means but I know they aren't crystal clear and perfectly balanced like the more expensive buds that reduce background noise. I have found that some of the songs I play are quieter than others. I never had that problem with my yurbuds. That can be controlled by the buttons on the ear piece. I haven't noticed a buzzy bass or a distorted pingy treble though.
does it block out all noise (dangerous if running outside),"I've only tried it I have not used completely. at that time I could not listen to me speaking, but I was not paying attention to them so I could not tell."
Will it pair with a kindle fire.,"No idea, sorry. It seems like it would sync with any device that can find Bluetooth devices. Sorry I couldn't be more help."

I can't get it to pair with my iPhone 5. please help?,I had no problems at all with my iphone 4S. I just followed the directions and paired them. Sorry I can't be more help.
"I can't get this to connect to my iphone 5s. It doesn't pop up when i have the bluetooth on, and I've definitely followed the description!",You need to keep holding on the switch until it turn blue/red then you can search on your phone for tech007 .
Do all earbuds come with the behind-the-ear piece? I need them because the bud never stays in my ear alone.,Yes it comes with 2 pcs
I don&acute;t see a cutout for the speakers. Does this case affect its sound?,The speaker is on the back of the phone next to the camera. The case has tiny holes (20 to be specific) directly over the speaker. I have noticed no loss in sound with the case on.
Is this similar in texture and feel to the FREQUENCY incipio line? I have one for another phone and LOVE it. Not available for the Moto X.,Yes! Exact same material. Its a great Case!

We have instructions for AT&T and T-Mobile (USA only). We look forward to have you as a customer. Thanks, Gus"
What is the exact version of the firmware? Is it Android 4.2.1 or 4.2.2?,i have BLU_L100i_V15_GENERIC 2013-11-26 09:05 Android 4.2.1
Is this actually the L100a or the L100i? It says L100i in the title but then it mentions 3G HSPA 850/1900 which is the L100a version. Please advise.,Wrong description. Bits the l100i
Is anyone selling a case for this phone?,"This phone exists also under another name, E-something in some chinese stores they sell the full line of stuff for it."
Will this phone work in Europe?,"This is an unlocked phone, it will work anywhere worldwide as long as you use it with a GSM carrier that is compatible with this phone's operating bands."
"What kind of SIM cards this mobile use? SIM, Micro-SIM or Nano-SIM? Tks.",there are two sim slots. one is for normal sized sim cards (mini sim) and the other is for micro sim cards

Will this hold an iPad mini? I am a bit worried about pot holes,"Magnet on Mountek is pretty powerful, that should handle the task. However the part goes in to your CD player defienetely cannot carry the weight of your iPad Mini, couldn't even carry my iPhone 5!!! I don't recommend this if you are going to use it with your CD player. Check out InfiniApps Magnetic Stand ( not the one with the CD lip mount). Good luck!"
How many badges does this come with and can you order additional ones?,The order will come with 2 badges and there will be an option to purchase additional badges soon.
Will it hold a Nexus 5? I'm not necessarily looking for charging it or using NFC in combination with this. I just need a nice magnetic holder.,Sure will. It holds my LG G2 with a otterbox defender and its bigger and heavier than the nexus 5.
"Are both of the badges the same? Are they both useful with a heavier device, or is one if them thin?","One is thicker than the other and supports more weight. I went straight for the heavier one for my Note, didn't test the thinner one."
How come some people are receiving 2 and some 3 badges?,"I *think* it is a product of whether you pre-ordered the nGroove or not. It is supposed to come with only 2, but because the pre-orders were so delayed in shipping, they added a third badge to the order."
Has anyone tried this with the Samsung Galaxy 2014 Edition? Measures a little over 6 inches (W) &amp; 9 1/2 (H) Little over 1.5 LBS.,I am returning this product. My Galaxy Note 2 kept falling off!!
"How much (how many degrees) will the magnetic holder move horizontally left/right, or is it rigid?",I would figure 270 in any direction; it's a ball joint.
"Where would i place the plate on Samsung Note 3 to ""offset it"" so it doesn't interfere with NFC?",Mine works great with it placed on the lower back side toward the charging port.
Doesn't the magnet interfere with proper operation of the compass function in a GPS or GPS enabled phone?,I have used it with an iPhone 4 and a nexus 5 and have had no interference issues with either one
Will it hold a note 3 with a charger plugged in?,It should hold note 3 and charger if you have spare metal plate behind cellphone or under cover case it will hold!
Can you confirm the size specifications for me? iPhone 4 is 4.5 inches and otterbox is 4.76 in x 2.53 in x 0.56 which won't fit in either pouch.,"I'm sorry I can't speak to actual dimensions but I have one iPhone in a very thin Splash case which increases width only by about an eighth of an inch but there is not room for a case on the other. It's a work phone so I won't buy a case for it. I honestly don't think an otter box will fit in this case at all, much less with another phone. I hope this helps."
IPhone 5 can not possibly fit. iPhone 4.87 inches and case on the large size measures 4.27 inches. The is misleading,"I have and iPhone 5 and iPhone 4 that fit just fine in this case. Now I don't bulky protectors on either phone, but the phones themselves fit easily."
Will this work with a galaxy S4?,See dimensions in details. The Galaxy series pop f phones are not supported now.
"I have an IPhone 5 and an IPhone 4, one business and one personal. I need to carry both phones during the day. Will the I-Phone 5 work with this case?","It most certainly. This item, believe it or no, took over two years to develop. As we neared the end of development the 5 came out. We went back to ensure it will fit also. Check the size specifications on the product details. Thanks for asking."
Has anyone tested the efficiency? like repeatedly recharge the same battery than do the math? because if this is even close to 75% im in for 2!,"The power bank is good. Works perfectly. Fully and easily charges from AC power, and the charge lasts for weeks while still regularly charging your phone/camera batteries.The time it takes the power bank to charge my phone battery is the same time with AC power (I mean normal power from the wall unit). I've used the power bank since November 2013. I bought it because I was traveling abroad to a remote community without electricity to charge my gadgets. Even back in the US, I'm still using it especially outdoors because my phone battery runs down very fast. So over to you"
"Is this 50,000 mAh battery capable of charging a laptop computer?",Unless you have special equipment I would say NO. The charge is released by 2 USB ports not from a wall outlet so for a standard laptop that charges by wall outlet you can't plug it in. You would need to convert from DC to AC current and then adapt the plug type from 3 prong to USB. Also the amperage of the charge produced from the larger USB outlet on this device is 5 amps. That is a very slow charge in laptop terms. It would at best slow down your drain rate while the laptop is turned.
will this device re-charge a Kindle HD?,Yes and fast.
Can this item be delivered to india and is it door to door delivery?....do i need to pay tax above this price ?,"Have not yet, do not know"
My Device needs 750mA Max power output but from the description above I read the output currents of the the battery bank are 1000mA and 2100mA .so how can it works with my device? the higher output current doesn't damage my device? please clarify me...,"This isn't a car battery with straight wires shoving into your phone like Frankenstein. I don't know what kind of ""device"" you have but I'm pretty sure it won't have a problem charging with this"
"Hello, why is isn't the battery charging my devices? It's just pulsating. Please help...is it defective?",Make sure you are charging from the right port. If that's correct. .make sure it's charged for 24 hrs. ..If not successful. .its faulty. ..assuming that your charging a device has a good battery and the voltage is correct
what is circle time.,Well it depends on what kind of battery have and for how long you will use it but as for me which I have a 1500mAh Battery well lasted me for at least 9 hours if I don't use my phone at the same time
Do you ship from China or US?,"Hi,we ship from China.Thank you."
is 50.000 or 5.000 mAh?,"It is 50,000 Mah. Most cell phones are between 3,000 and 4,000 Mah. This would give you more than a week of backup on your battery."
"A lot of the comments say that this battery isnt really 50,000 mAh, they say its more like 10,000 - 15,000. Is there battery faulty???",everything is said and more my tablet my laptop and my phone any more power Annika start your car
Will it work on HTC Sensation,I'm not sure if the Sensation has Qi (wireless) charging built in or if it has pins inside the battery cover (like the Galaxy S3) to allow the addition of Qi internally. It may be possible to find a 3rd party case that would connect to the USB of the Sensation and allow for the charging to work.
Can this charger work with an Otter Box with a Galaxy S5 (Qi enabled)?,"It can, but a month later it will not work consistently since the pad will burn out internally causing you to constally unplug and replug the charging pad"
Does this support Moto X?,"The moto x does not support wireless charging. I understand it is possible to purchase a case for the moto x that will make it support wireless charging, but I have no experience with these products."
Can use this charger to htc one x,"This phone does not have native Qi charging capability, so no, you cannot."
Will this work with my s3?,Only if you have an aftermarket qi charge coil installed over your battery.
will this work for the dell venue 8 (andriod)?,"Hi Alyssa; this device is a transmitter of power in the Qi standard -- Qi is a standard just like ""NEMA-5-15"" is a standard that describes how your power cords plug into your walls in the USA. This device speaks ""Qi"". The problem is that I don't see a Dell Venue 8 receiver for the power. Just as Radio has a transmitter (the station) and receiver (your radio, converting radio waves into sound), you need a Qi receiver that converts Qi power into power to charge your battery. I just did a search for ""Qi Venue"" and found no matches on Amazon; you might have better luck. The key is that ""Qi"" symbol: make sure that you have a Dell Venue case or adapter for Qi, and this or any other Qi transmitter will work with your Dell."
Some mention having to reset the charger by unplugging and plugging it back in to have it charge. Do you have to do this as well?,"Yes, sometimes....."
Is there a reason I am only getting 12ma with this charger on my LG G2?,This chargers output is only 1mA when you use a 2mA adapter.
does it work well with galaxy S4?,No it doesn't work with s4. You need reciver chip.
will it work with the samsung galaxy s4,"Yes, It can fit for Samsung S4"
Will it work on HTC Sensation,I'm not sure if the Sensation has Qi (wireless) charging built in or if it has pins inside the battery cover (like the Galaxy S3) to allow the addition of Qi internally. It may be possible to find a 3rd party case that would connect to the USB of the Sensation and allow for the charging to work.
Can this charger work with an Otter Box with a Galaxy S5 (Qi enabled)?,"It can, but a month later it will not work consistently since the pad will burn out internally causing you to constally unplug and replug the charging pad"
Does this support Moto X?,"The moto x does not support wireless charging. I understand it is possible to purchase a case for the moto x that will make it support wireless charging, but I have no experience with these products."
Can use this charger to htc one x,"This phone does not have native Qi charging capability, so no, you cannot."
Will this work with my s3?,Only if you have an aftermarket qi charge coil installed over your battery.
will this work for the dell venue 8 (andriod)?,"Hi Alyssa; this device is a transmitter of power in the Qi standard -- Qi is a standard just like ""NEMA-5-15"" is a standard that describes how your power cords plug into your walls in the USA. This device speaks ""Qi"". The problem is that I don't see a Dell Venue 8 receiver for the power.

My charger seems to turn off after an hour or more (no LED lights are on). I have to unplug/plug it in again. Is this normal? My phone will not charge when the LED lights are off,I have a simular issue. I had planned to return it.
"Will this work with a Samsung note 3, with the QI wireless charging case?","I have the Samsung Galaxy S4 with the Samsung wireless charging case (QI compatible) and it works great! It charges at 620 milliamps, which is a little faster than over usb charging on a computer and slower than plugging in the cable to the wall directly. I bought 2 - one for overnight charging and one for charging at work in the afternoon. There is only a dim blue light when you start charging, no beeps or noise."
I have a Glxy S3 with a broken power port. Currently I have to remove battery and place on charger. Will this work so I don't have to remove battery?,"If your phone supports qi charging, yes should work for you."
"my phone will not keep charging,, it starts but then it stops... what do i do?","I do not know about your particular phone's charging issues, but with my Samsung Galaxy s3 I learned that the problem (and apparently a common one with Samsung phones) is that the USB recharging port has poor quality soldering. I've ultimately found that a better solution than USB charging or even using the Lerway wireless Qi ""drop-pad charger"" is to use multiple batteries with wall charging units. I believe I've written a review for such a product - it was around $20 for the charging unit and 2 spare batteries. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE how fast and efficient wall chargers/spare batteries are. I know have 7 spare batteries so I can keep several at home, a few in my office, a few in the car, etc. I can pop out a discharged battery and replace it with a fully charged on in about 15 seconds. Forget USB and drop-pad chargers."
"Hi, I don't know if I'm charging my phone, it is currently dead. When I put my phone on the charger the LED light will turn blue, but sometimes it wil blink, or sometimes, blink blue to green, theere is no red like some people are saying. What is...","When you place your phone on the pad, the indicator light should turn blue for normal operation. The indicator light will occasionally flash Blue/Green once it senses that the phone has reached an adequate charge state. A red indicator light means that there is a problem with either the charger, the battery or both. If your battery is completely dead, and will not take a charge then the battery must be replaced. Never completely let a lithium battery discharge, that will kill it. This is unlikely in your phone, since it has a protective circuit built in to avoid this. It can take 8 to 12 hours to recharge a phone that will not turn on because of a low battery. The other possibility is the recharging receiver built into the phone. If it is defective it may need to be replaced. If the phone will charge with a wired charger then that may be the problem."
Can this wipe an SD card? My SD files were recently deleted and I don't know if this is why.,??????? My SD card is intact with no problems. Try researching the problem through Qi technical sites......
Does it connect to the Lumia 920 NFC ability?,"It does, but if the battery is critically low it will not charge."
Does this make the phone warm or heat up during charging?,"I have four different wireless chargers, including this one. The phone/tablet gets slightly (and equally) warm on all of them. However, if you allow the phone/tablet to ""daydream"" (display clock or other graphic of choice) while wireless charging the phone/tablet gets very warm, even hot. I find this to be equal on all chargers as well. I always push the power button after the phone/tablet starts charging. This stops the dream mode. Also you can disable dream mode in the display settings. I like this particular charger because it's easy to line up the coils and the green/red/blue light is visible from top, end and sides. Bottom line is if your phone/tablet is active while charging, it will get hot. The charger itself doesn't cause the heat."
I have a Diztronic silicone case on my phone. Do I have to remove this case to use the wireless charger?,Yes it works through most cases. The only cases that don't work are the huge otterboxes.
How bright is the light(s)?,"Not very bright at all. The led is actually underneath the housing, which seems to be semi transparent in that area."

there is a pic of case opening on the front as is its a snap door to protect screen. You can't turn it around am I missing something???,Ya.when I got it.i thought the same thing.ao when I tried to bit the case where the screen went.and I didn't work.and I found out that the pocket thing is to hold cards.
will this fit I phone 5C thank THANK YOU Lynda,I'm not sure.. I purchased this for the original iPhone 5
"What does ""2 pcs"" mean? Does that mean this is two cases?",Yes it's two cases.. I didn't know that at first because the case has two parts (a rubber piece and a hard piece) but in the package it's two cases.
how well does this case protect the phone if dropped face down? are all the buttons easy to use,there is a small lip that goes around the glass of the phone... so there is some protection.. I find that the buttons are easy to use without a lot of pressure. Hope this helps :-)
Does it cover the front of the phone as well?,"It wraps around the edges, but does not cover the screen. We bought a screen protector also."
what are the dimensions on this phone? I have the smaller one and want to make sure I'm getting the right case.,The dimensions are approximately 5 by 2 1/2 inches.
I see a stylus in the photo but no mention is made of it. Is there one? Does it connect to the case?,There was a stylus. I do not know if it connects to the case.
Does this cover fit the S4 mini i435 as well?,It's made for the galaxy s4mini but no cut outs on either side. Raised areas to push in.. placements of certain cutouts are made for that particular brand.
Can i use this case for any mini s4?,I dont see why not they are all the same as far as I know. But they do not protect from anything besides scratches really.
Is this case for s4 galaxy mini answer asap I mean like now!,Yes
is it durable,"I would say yes, although I love the mint green color it did get dirty pretty easily. All the bends in the plastic are dark in color. Not really a big deal and probably to be expected because it is a pale color."
"does the ""fingerprint"" work with this model?",Yes it works very well all the way around :) totally recommend it
Will this case fit the iphone 5c?,no it will not fit
Is there a belt clip available?,No belt clip
Does the case interfere with the headphone jack?,No it does not. It works great with the power cord as well.
Can I use it for an Ipod 5?,No
Will this case fit an iPhone 5c?,Not very well. Doesn't fit correctly where you turn ringer to silent
Will this case fit a iPhone 5c?,I have a 5s and from what I understand is they're basically same structure. Check at a phone retailer and look where the side buttons and camera eye and charger slot places are. That shud answer ur question as to fit.
Does this case have a clip that goes with it?,No clip
Does this case have screen protection?,"If it is the same case as my Broncos one, it does not have screen protection."
Would it fit a 5c?,"No, I believe it is made to fit 5/5s."
Do you have this case for an iPhone 6?,Not yet. It is on order though
Does this fit the iPhone 5c pretty well?,Yes it does. I gave one to my son-in-law (Patriots) for Christmas and he was very pleased with it.
is it waterproof?,No it's not! It's just a case but protects the phone real good from drops
i would like a high quality pittsburgh steelers iphone 5 case !!!! one with a rubber outer cover !!! can you help me ?,"Hi Chris, I have the Colts version of this case. I believe it's fairly good quality, I bought it for my husband but then the next week we upgraded to new phones so we didn't use it very much. On the Colts one that I'm selling, the sides are plastic and the back had a rubber feel. Of course the liner is rubber similar to an otteebox liner. Hope you find the one you want!"
Does this come with a belt clip?,No. Better luck next year
So will this fit a 5c? One of the answers say it will and the other says it won't.,I bought the colts one. I have a 5s. I don't know the diff. My family has 5c and can't see the diff in the style. Think the diff are technical like better camera quality etc. hope this helps. Talk to ur carrier ask what style diff there are. Hope I am some help. &#128522;
can I use with clip holder,If you hav a holster that itll fit. I work in a cell phone store and this case very closely resembles a thin ballistic case
Forever Collectibles San Francisco 49ers Rugged Dual Hybrid Samsung Galaxy S4 Case - Is this SF logo a sticker?,I have Ravens and it is quality logo raised slightly as a part of the cover. Not a Sticker.
will this fit the active?,Yes
does it work for the iPhone 5c,I'm sorry I don't have an iPhone 5C just a iPhone 5. So I wouldn't know to be exact.
thumbprint scan work?,"I am not familiar with the thumbprint scan, but there is not anything covering the front of the phone. The case only covers the sides and back."
Will this case fit the 5th Gen iPod as well?,yes it will . just poorly made !!! mine broke while installing !!!!
Will this case fit the 5th Gen iPod as well?,hon it didnt fit my husbands sorry i wouldnt buy it
Does this come with any type of belt clip?,No. It does not. I haven't had any problems without one.
do you make this for a zte avail z990 phone that is what i have and would love this case,Sorry not at this time. :(
How does this compare to the Otterbox commuter series? I want to make sure this case can handle several drops,It isn't an otterbox but definetely the case can handle any drops. The rubber on the edges helps a lot. I love my case. The only bad thing is the team that you picked.
Does this case fit the iPhone 5c?,"No, it fits the 5 and the 5s. The 5c is different size case."
Does this cover fit the iPhone 5C?,"It doesn't fit the 5C very well. I put up with the poor fit for a couple months before I replaced it. All the buttons worked, but the edges always had some ""strain""."
Do you have this for Samsung galaxy s4?,"Currently we are out of stock for Samsung S4. Sincerely, Cellnstyle Team."
does this just cover the front or is it more like an otter box?,"It covers the solid back and s four sides, but not the screen. My husband has an otter box and it is not as secure as an otter box if that makes sense."
"Does the case provide protection for the front edges and corners of the phone, or only the back?","It covers the entire left and right front edge, but the top and bottom front edges, as well as most of the corner front edges, are exposed. In fact, only the back edges of the top and bottom are covered."
Does it maintain the curve of the phone,Yes
Is this a plastic case? What material is this?,Yes it is a plastic case with very little flexibility
Is anyone else who purchased this having issues with the adjustable sides NOT locking in once the phone is sitting in the holder?,Mine locks ok.
I have a gps app that I like to view with the phone horizontal - does this holder allow me to rotate the phone to a horizontal orientation?,"Yes. You are able to rotate the phone. I use my gps app all the time. I'm so happy with it!!! I also hear music I have downloaded to my phone, and it makes it easy to change songs too;)"
Do the side things obstruct your vision of the phone's screen when looking at it from the side?,Nope! It does tilt
sounds like it will hold an iPhone 4 OK?,"Yep, holds any size phone, because it opens and closes to your desired width. I love mine. Suuuuper useful!"
Will this work with an otterbox case?,Yes and it is easily adjustable. I own a Ford Expedition and it fits great with both my otterbox and lifeproof cases.
"All of the air vents in my car have VERTICAL slots, will it still hold t my phone in place without falling?",I don't think it will be that supportive with the vertical slots. The unit has a flap at the bottom of it that works as support by resting on one of the lower slots of the air vents. So I don't think it will provide enough support for your air vents.
Will this bend the air vent over time due to gravity and the weight of the phone?,I don't think so. I have a 5c phone and it isn't causing any deformation. The only catch is the loss of ventilation flow; but this is minor. I love mine so far.
Where is this product made &amp; what is the estimated delivery?,It is made in China and estimated delivery date is 10 to 20 days from the date buyer purchased
Is this ok for Moto g?,Yes it will accommodate both versions one and two Moto G devices.
Will it hold a LG Tracpone that slides,"I am uncertain as that is not the phone I have, but I do find the pressure that it provides when holding my phone is substantial. The sides have a pressure release which tightens when you place the phone in it. I cannot imagine that wouldn't hold any type phone."
Does this fit the XT926,"I suggest you search on Amazon for a case for that specific model. Cases are generally designed for the individual phone type. And a warning - this is a cute and very durable case, but it had a strong chemical odor for several months."
Does this fit the Razr HD X926 - not a maxx. I'm confused by some of the comments,Yes this fits the DROID RAZR HD x926
Does this case fit the Droid Maxx XT1080?,"Yes. It was very snug, but I was able to snap it in place."
would this case fit just a razr hd...not the maxx hd?,I have the HD and it fits perfectly.
would this case fit just a razr hd...not the maxx hd?,yes it will. i have the hd razor and i got the case for my phone and it fits.
is it just a one piece cover or two ? and does it protect the front side,"It's two pieces; the back completely covers the back and, as in the image, the front portion frames the screen. I'm not aware of any covers that protect the screen itself. I suggest you purchase screen protectors; they're thin pieces of plastic film - they'll prevent scratches but will allow you access to your apps, etc."
Does this fit the Droid Maxx or is the Droid Razor Maxx something different?,Maxx and maxx HD r two different phones
Can you put a case over your phone with the screen protector on or is it too thick?,I put a case on mine. It doesn't cover any of the glass front but very happy with it!
Can I take off and put on different phone,No
Can you put a case that does cover the front edges a littlle?,"Yes, It's thin enough. I have a cover with a rubber bumper that lays over the front slightly."
What is the home button sticker? How does it affect the fingerprint sensor on the Iphone 5s?,"There is no sticker on home button, just a round hole. It doesn't affect the sensor, although the button is kind of deeper because of 0.4mm thickness of the protector, but once you get use to it(1 day) its fine. Anyway the protector is waaaay better than plastic stickers"
None of the reviews mention removal- Can this screen protector be removed without breaking or leaving adhesive residue behind or any other problems?,Yes it can. I removed mine easily all you have to do is lift it up from one corner. No adhesive is left either
This screen protector covers the front-facing camera lens- what is your experience with the adhesive's effect on the clarity &amp; distortion of pics?,I didn't even realize it covered the front facing camera until this question was proposed!
how do iget ringtones,I have never try i am not using it
Is the display on this COMPLETELY READABLE in BRIGHT SUNLIGHT?,Yes the display is readable in bright sunlight. To make the battery last I have a battery management program on it and it will dim it when in doors and brighten it when out doors.
how long does the battery last?,The battery lasts quite a while if you add a battery management app. It will turn things off that drain the battery like gps. If you leave the gps on it will drain it in a day. I was on the phone talking to a friend for about 2 hours and it didn't hardly make a dent in the time left on the battery. I do turn the wifi on when I want to down load something quickly as the 3g is a little slow. But as long as you remember to turn it off when you are done it doesn't take up too much power. I hope this helps.
Will this work with Sprint?,Yes alall our phones are unlocked they work world wide all the majority of all providers....
Can this be activated with cricket wireless? Great review.,All our phones are unlocked just call you provider with the specifications and they will tell you but any unlocked phone should work.
Is the primary camera 13mp or 8mp? And the secondary?,Primary camera 13 secondary 8
"screen size, please","4.7"" but stay alert cos they offer the E975 but deliver the F180L the korean version!"
ram 2 or 1.5 ?,The phone has 2 GB of RAM
which are the product dimensions,131.9 x 68.9 x 8.5 mm (5.19 x 2.71 x 0.33 in) You can see an image here: http://www.lg.com/es/images/telefonos-moviles/optimus-g-e975/gallery/lg-movil-optimusG-medidaLARGE.jpg

"Which android version is this phone, and is it upgradeable?","The version is 4.4. About the upgradeability, I think the answer is yes. The first time when I turned on the phone, it asked me to upgrade the system. Because of that, I couldn't see the primary android version. I hope to help you."

Can be used in Venezuela with Movistar?,I do not know. It works in Argentina with Movistar.
Can it be used with straight talk,no it will not work with straight talk.
What US carriers can be used with this cell phone to have a 3g connection in California?,"Look for a carrier which is said to be GSM ""Global System for Mobile"", some of the US carriers that use GSM are t-mobile, At&t, Net10 wireless, H2O wireless, and others. Most of these offer 3g connection service. This is one of the two types of connection protocols in the United States, the other being cdma. GSM phones allow insertion of a sim card, cdma phones do not. Sprint and Verizon are the major cdma carriers in the united states. cheers"

is it worth my money?,"I would buy it again, it looks good. You just need to concentrate when you are putting it on and it will stretch if you pull on it too hard. But everyone that sees it thinks it is the actual case so I would say its worth the money."
does it reallly work good,yes it looks good on phone just make sure when putting it on you don't stretch it. It will bubble in the bottom corner. That is where I had problem but other than that good product.
does this go on the outside of a lifeproof case or do you need the clear lifeproof case?,no you can put it over any color lifeproof case. I actually bought my son a white one because it was on sale and covered it with the skin. couldn't even tell it. make sure it is straight and in the right place. doesn't come off easily if you screw up.
Is it real and does it work,It holds to phone great! And fits the contours very well. It's especially perfect for giving your phone a different look. Ours never came off.

is this headset foldable,Yes it is
Has anyone had success connecting these to the PS3/PS4?,"I can connect these headphones with my PS3, but you can not hear game sound. You can talk and hear others when you play multiplayer game online. If you do want to use them to listen to game, music or movie, I suggest you to get a Bluetooth transmitter and hook it up with your TV audio output. (I did this in my home setting up)"
"I can't get the microphone to work with VOIP, just in-game and on my phone. Windows 8. How to fix?","What is VOIP you using? Did you ever try changing the Bluetooth profile? If they work with Skype, I think they should work with others."
I have an old Dell Dimension 3000 desktop w/o bluetooth. Will a USB Bluetooth converter that plugs into the USB port let me make/receive phone calls?,"Yes, you can use USB Bluetooth converter to pair and connect to VOXOA HD Wireless Headphones. Hence, you can make/receive phone calls through Skype or Google voice. Thank you for your interests in our products. Cheers, Team VOXOA."
Is there any lag between picture and sound when viewing a video (streaming or otherwise) on an iOS device?,Not at all! I really like these. I wish they were over eat instead of on eat. But I know that before buying them. I may sell mine. Haven't used them much.
Can anyone with 8.1.2 iOS connect to these headphones? I can connect with 8.1.1 on iPad but not 8.1.2 on iPhone. I have tried to Reset All Settings.,These headphones work fine for me with my iPhone 5S running 8.1.2.
Can you activate Siri from the headphones? and if so how well does it work?,Sorry I can't answer that question since all my devices are Android. I know that by holding the Play/Pause button open the voice dialer and by double pressing the power button dialed the last contact. Sorry that I couldn't answer your question but I hope this helped a bit.
Does this have an adaptive noise cancelling feature?,No it does not. In fact it lets a large amount of ambient noise in
Can these headphones be used for running or working out?,I found them too big for running. They also wouldn't stay in my head for running. Maybe for weight training. I prefer in ear for working out. If I were to go with other type of headphones I think I would use over the ear for working out rather than on ear. I hope this helps.

Does this fit the samsung prism II,Yes it fits I have the exact phone from T-mobile. Have dropped it multiple times and not a scratch!!
"Is this case actually ""Rubberized"" like the description states?","In my opinion, NO. It's hard plastic that snaps on. It is not the soft GEL rubber...I have one of those too."
Will this cover fit Huawei Vision U8687,Yes it will. I bought one which is the same match. Its designed for T-Mobile prism 2. Good buy.
Does this come with a screen protector?,No it doesn't. But the cutouts line out perfectly for the Prism Mobile II.
How do you tell when it's fully charged,When you are charging the battery pack it blinks green while charging. The light will stay solid green when it is fully charged.
I have had it plugged in for more than an hour &amp; it is flashing orange. Is it charging?,Mine quit working after one month. It was doing the same thing. The company was no help at alland will not reply back to emails or calls.
Any opinions on if it would be okay to charge this device with a standard iPhone power brick (5v 1A)? I know the literature says to charge it at 5v 2Amp,"Yes, it should be okay. I use a 5v 1A charger to charge from the wall, as well as my laptop's USB port, and both the approaches have worked well."
How long is the charging time for Newtrent powerpak 11.0 nt110t,Don't buy this pack. Mine quit working after a month and a half. I only used it four times. New Trent has not offered any remedies.
How long does this hold its own charge without use?,"I don't really know but it still had a decent charge after a month once. I used to charge it before each trip. But, the unit just died after 6 months so I would not recommend it - a few other folks seemed to have the same experience. I also have their newer model - the NT11.0 - which seems to be doing better. Hope this is helpful."
Can I charge this battery back up using a 220v source? (International) Does it say anything on the packaging that it is only 110 or 120v?,"You will need to use a wall charger similar to what you use for an iPhone or iPad. Most of these are rated for 220V. The wall charger converts the input voltage, typically 100-240V, to 5V for the typical mobile device. This powerpak is specified for an input of 5V at 1.5A. Input and output is listed on the wall charger. So check the wall chargers you already have for your mobile devices, most likely they are rated for input voltages ranging from 100-240V, or 110-220V. Output voltage should be 5V. The output amps will typically be 1A or 2A, which tells you the maximum possible current for that charger. Ideally, you want 1.5A, or higher, output for this powerpak to give you fastest charge time."
any one having problems with this power pack not charging devices?,I've had no problems with it.
Can you charge this while it's charging your devices?,"I called their customer service & they said the thing connected to AC charge & to a phone simultaneously will charge the phone first and then charge the battery pack after that... their words, not mine..."
"Yes, I'd like to know if this charger charges a samsung galaxy smartphone? It says windows smartphones, mines not a windows. Does it keep the battery",Yes - it'll charge devices that can be charged with a USB charger. I use it for my iPhone and it works on my partner's Galaxy. I haven't had any problems with the batteries...
will it work with a kindle fire hd?,No

will it work with a kindle fire hd?,No
Is it iOS8 compatible?,"It does work with iOS8; but it really depends on what device you are using it on. We bought this for an iphone 5s and it worked with one ihome, but not another (different type) of ihome. I cannot figure out why it works on some an not others. It also does not work with an iphone 6 (the pin spacing is different)."
Has anyone used this with the 6 plus? Does it charge and play music?,I bought it for my 6 plus but the space between the audio jack and the 8 pin on the phone is way larger than on the adapter. It does fit my wife's 5s though - but note that it did not transmit audio when plugged into her phone and our existing 30 pin audio dock...it just charged. So I'm actually not sure of what scenario the audio portion of this adapter WOULD work in...
Does it work with the Iphone 5c?,"yes but only charges it on the dock, not allow it to play music on it."
will this fit the ipod nano 7g,"Not sure, but it's not worth the purchase. My IPHONE 5 went dead after using this....DON'T BUY!"
I have a belkin fm transmitter that transmits songs from iphone to my car radio. does this work with that?,"I couldn't get it to fit into my phone, so it wouldn't work that way at all. The male prongs didn't line up with the phone"
I have a 2000 honda civic and i'm not sure if this will connect to my car so that it'll play music? any help?,I connect it to our ihome radio which was for our iphone4 and with my iPhone5 I'm able to hear the music through it. And at planet fitness treadmill which is why I got this adapter for my iPhone5 works great.
Does it support microphone (audio-in)?,Yes it does (that is what the tall plug on the left is for). Just make sure you are buying this for the right device. It is working great for us (to plug our iPod touch into an older stereo).
Does it work with a case?,"No, I think you need to remove the case."
does it work with sony bd\dvd home theatre system bdv-t11,"The adapter is ok. It works sometimes; not all. Sometimes I can't use the remote control to the device it sits on. Other time it doesn't charge my phone while it's on the doc. Best advice is rather than pay for the adapter, replace the device to fit your phone rather than go through the heart ache. Blame apple for their marketing tactics that make us replace phones every year....go figure."
does it work for the ipod touch 5,"In the bigining does, but now is not working..."
is this a flip case that snaps shut?,"It doesnt actually snap shut, there's A magnet on the edge of the case.it definitely opens easily."
Does this case have slots to hold credit cards,"Sorry Ruby, there are no credit card slots in this case"
Does it have credit card slots?,No it doesn't. I got the baby blue with butterfies. I love it. I get a lot of compliments on it.
"PROTECTION: This looks like a nice case, but does it offer high protection? And grip?",My phone has taken a few falls from the arm of the couch to the hard wood floors and no damage. The sides of the case are textured making it grippy. My case is clear. The frosted part on the back is a bit dingy after about a months use. I will try a magic eraser to see if it helps.
Does the case cover the volume buttons? thx :),Yes. If you got custom colors they will be lost in the color of the case. The buttons still function well through the case.
FLASH: Does the clear Wave model have the blurry flash issue that the model without the frosted back does? Due to the narrow flash cutout...,"Yes, unfortunately it does. I corrected the issue by enlarging the cutout with a sharp knife. I removed the indented section around the flash and between the flash and the lense. Still looks good, protects the same."
Would the clear case look good over a wood Moto X or is it so clouded on the back that it would hide the grain? Any other suggestions for clear case?,"Yes, you would definitely still see the wood grain. The only drawback with the Clear case is that it doesn't remain clear -- it ""yellows"" with time and use."
clear case,"It is. It's sort of opaque, but a key reason I got it was because it's colorless/clear."
COLOR: Does the white or clear yellow or stain quickly?,I've had mine for a month and so far there's been no yellowing or staining
"Is this really the same case as the ""GreatShield Guardian S Series Slim Fit Wave Design TPU Case for Motorola Moto X Phone""?","I own the Cimo case, and this GreatShield case looks veeery similar on those pictures. I'd venture to say they are the same thing."
"Does the blue color one become discolored over time? I got the Wave Color in May, now it is all yellow/dark brown. Does this happen to other colors?","I purchased the blue for one of my co-workers & haven't noticed this problem. I bought the white, which is more clear than white, but it has not discolored. I don't think they should discolor in that amount of time. I would hope it would wipe clean, but if the plastic is actually discolored, I might think about an exchange."
"Is there a ""lip"" so when laying face down, the screen does not touch the surface it is laying on?","Yes, there is. It's not very large, but easily sufficient."
thin,Yes .. I would say 1/16 to 1/8 inch
"I keep my phone in my back pocket a lot. I used to have a 'rubbery' case, but it was hard to get it in and out of my pocket. Is this case 'sticky' or will it slide in and out of my pocket easily?",I do the same thing where I put it I'm my back pocket. It does slide in and out easily but keep in mind if you wear skinny jeans it does grip a bit more. If you put the phone camera side down then the grippy rubbery part of the case makes less contact with the pocket.
what color case works best with a white moto,"Any case will work and show off the phone. However, my wife has a Moto X and customized it...so wanted a clear case to show off the entire back. Guess this is not possible as you cannot see the custom wording on the back of the phone. The Clearer the case the better you see the phone and not just the case."
Are the buttons of the phone covered or uncovered?,"The three buttons on the side are covered, the case hase raised molded buttons."
Does this have cut-outs for buttons or raised buttons that press onto the phone buttons?,Raised takes a bit to get used to but not too bad.
"Can you feel the buttons? (power, volume up and down)? I realize you'd have to press them ""through"" the case, tha'ts OK, as long as i can feel 'em","Yes, you can feel them. For the price it's a great case!! I like it better than the one I paid over 3x's the amount for from Motorola."
"I don't particularly love the design on the back. Is it very noticeable when it is on the phone? Also, how much grip did you find it provides?","The design is pretty noticeable to be honest-the right portion of the swirl is completely clear plastic and the rest is sort of ""cloudy"" so you do see the design. The grip is really good.Stays in a pocket well but not so sticky it's annoying."
volume,All switches work properly with this cover. I gave not noticed any affect on volume with cover installed versus no cover.
anyone have experience dropping the phone with the case? Any major damage or does the case hold well,"Yes, we have had instances of the phoe being dropped with no danage, but theses were minor. This case is not designed to keep the phone safe from large or severe drops. It is to provide limited protection, allow the user to be able to grip the slippery phone easier and also allow for phone identification due to the various case colors available."
Anyone have any complaints with the provided screen protector?,I haven't used the screen protector that came with my case yet. I'm still using the one that came with the phone.
Can this cover be used with a wireless charging pad,I don't know.... Sorry.
Do you have to leave the case on all the time? Even when not charging?,Yes. You can take it off after it's done charging if you want though.
"Is it long range, or does it have to touch the pad?",It has to be lined up perfectly on the pad. It does require direct contact.
can i put it in a otter box case,No. The back has to touch the pad in order to charge and the case makes the phone a little longer because of the unit that plugs into the bottom of the phone.
What are the dimensions of the charging pad?,It's about a 4-inch by 4-inch square.
Does the pad have to be plugged in to charge the phone or does the pad hold a charge?,It has to be plugged in.
Does wireless charging take more time than cable charging? Cause there might be some energy loss due to electromagnetic energy transfer.,"I would say slightly longer, but not so much you would be frustrated with it. I just leave it on the charging pad when I go to sleep when I'm really low or beside me in the office when I know I'll need a boost that day for traveling around."
Will this case work with the charging pad on the 2015i Escalade?,"I have no idea. It would not work with the charging pad that shipped with it. There is a remote possibility that the current in my USB adapter was insufficient to make it work, but I tried two different USB adapters, including the original Apple model that came with the iPhone and could never get it to work. It sort of tried, but ultimately it was a fail and I sent it back. Good luck."
"does the product work if your port has been damaged, i see the adapter has to be put into the port but mine isn't responding to any cords",I have iphone 5s-port does not align to to adapter but not to worry you won't need it because it work perfectly on the charger without being tied to a cord port--Jerry V.
"If my IPhone 5 is completely dead, and no wire chargers will charge it, will this charge up my phone?",No
Do they make one for an Ipad? Thanks,"Hi, Carol We currently don't have the receiver for iPad to QI enable it , the charging pad will work for QI enabled device only."
Does this case take away from the curved feel of the phone?,Not at all. The only set back is the sides of the screen are kinda hard to get to with the raised sides. Sometimes I have to put them out of the way to get to the Q and P keys on the vertical keyboard. But over all it is easily worth the price.
"I don't particularly love the design on the back. Is it very noticeable when it is on the phone? Also, how much grip did you find it provides?","It is quite noticeable- but I rather like it over the plain designs that I saw on other covers. The edges are from shiny, polished rubber, that offers good grip for your hand, not as good as leather though."
Is this case easily removable? can i use continue using NFC tags after adding this case? is the side buttons easily pressed or hard to press?,Hi - the case can easily be put on and remove. The quality of material and fit to the phone is great. I haven't used the NFC tags yet but I would be surprised if it didn't work. I was presently surprised how good the side buttons work. My last case had the buttons exposed which made the case rub and lift the screen protector. Hope this helps.
stain,Done know what you mean by stain?
"Is this case for the MOTO X 2nd generation (2014) or the old, smaller 2013 phone?",First generation case
"Judging by the photo, it appears that this case will take away the ""dimple"" feature on the back of the case. Is this correct?","Yes, but there are cutouts for the camera and speaker."

How long are these cables?,I have these on order but haven't received them yet. But from the description they should be approximately 3ft (1M).
Will they work for a Samsung Galaxy S3?,"Yes, it should work just fine"
Will this work with a Kindle?,"They are micro USB cables, so they should/will work with kindle."
Is the end a micro (extra tiny) or just a mini,"micro (very small), used in the cell phones and most electronic gadgets made in the last 3-4 years."
"hi, the pack have 4 cables? how long they have?","yes,4pcs of pack,1m length"
Does it work on the samsung galaxy exhibit?,It should work on any micro usb device you have. It might not charge as quickly or fit as well as the original charger cable that came with your device.
Do they work with a Samsung Convoy 3 Phone?,Yes
Is the data transfer working?,Yes. But it charges very slowly.
Will they work for the Samsung galaxy note 3 &amp; Kindle fire hdx 8.9 inch?,It does work for the galaxy note 3.
how long are they?,One meter.
Hi! I was wondering what is the estimated battery life of the Patuoxun Red Sports Bluetooth stereo Music Earphone Headset? Thank you. Dan,if you're listening to music only about 3.5hrs if you talk on the phone the time varies from about 2-2.5 hrs.
"Also, I am worried about the size of my head (size 8). Is it adjustable or is it a one size fits all? Thank you again.","It is one size fits all, but it is pretty flexible. I think it would fit almost any head size."
Can I use this item with my LG Optimus?,I dond have lg optimus i am sorry
I can't get this to play music or books with iPhone 5. It will make phone calls fine. Center button always gets me voice control and music plays from the iPhone speaker. What am I missing?,It maybe be that it does not run that application. If they work on calls you tube and music and your movies then it might be the app
Does it work with PS3?,Don't know
Does it come with different size ear buds?,no
Has anybody used it while running? How does it fit while running?,not yet
This product works with all phones.,For phone calls it works well with iPhone 5. I can't get it to play music or books from my iPhone 5 though.
"Hello, do you ship this item to Venezuela?","Yes, we can ship to Venezuela with UPS or FedEx but need some more extra fee. Please contact personally for more detail."

Is this is phone is come factory unlocked ?,Yes
Can the OS be upgraded to Android (4.4 Kitkat),Not for now.

Will this work on an I Phone 4?,"Yes, the Vaavud will work with the iPhone 4, 4S, 5, 5C, 5S, Samsung Galaxy S3, S4 and the HTC One."
"How far away does it work from the iPhone? For instance, if you have it say attached to a stick in the ground.","Unless that stick has a headphone jack and a cord going to your phone, not very far."
work on Motolora X?,Apparently it will only not work with Sony phones. I would strongly recomend you to visit their site at : http://vaavud.com/
Will this work on an IPod?,It would have to have the app and I don't think there is one for the iPod.
Do you need an Internet connection for it to work?,No you do not need Internet for this meter to work. You only need a connection to report wind speeds.
Hi will this work with a Samsung Avant Smart Phone ?,I have only used it with an Ipad.
Does it need cell service or wifi to collect data?,No
"Does it works with iphone 5s or 5c and ipad air?, Thanks",Check the information on their website. http://us-shop.vaavud.com/products/vaavud-wind-meter-white it should work with your iPhone and the iPad air.
How does it connect to the ipad/iphone? Via Bluetooth? (which seldom works in my experience) Thanks,"Someone please correct me if I'm wrong, but from what I can tell, the anemometer itself does not use power. When I first used the device, there was no prompt to connect anything using Bluetooth, and the app registered readings right away. The headphone jack piece (which, I believe, is made out of solid plastic) seems to be solely used to attach the device to the iphone/ipad, not to charge or sync the device in any way. Even if you hold the anemometer close to your iphone/ipad without plugging it in, the app will still register the readings. I read that the anemometer uses magnets, so my assumption is that the phone can sense the rotation of the magnets in close range (maybe in the same way it can sense compass readings?). This is all based on my observations, but the packaging lacked any in-depth information so I hope this helps. If you're mainly asking whether or not the app/anemometer has problems connecting, I had no connection issues."
Can I use my current cell phone number and transfer it to the new phone,"only if the number you are transferring is an active number with carrier you are on now. It will take a few days to process, but check with your current cell provider."
Are the 1200 minutes tripled to 3600 minutes or is this 400 minutes that are tripled to 1200 minutes?,"400 minutes are tripled to 1200, but you can go on the internet and get a bonus code and when you activate the phone it will give you another two months service and 250 more hours. Total of 1,450 minutes and 424 days service. Be careful, some sellers are not including both the 1200 minutes and the year of service."
Does the caller's ID pop up when you get a call (before you answer)?,Yes
Do text messages count as .3 minutes or are they one minute?,A text message is 0.3
IS this phone the phone and then a 400 card that you can activate at any time later?,"I'm not the seller of this phone, but since it says that you receive a pin for the minutes/days, you should be able to use that at a later time or even of a different Tracfone. Keep in mind, that if your other phone doesn't have triple minutes for life, you wont receive 1200 minutes, but 400 (unless your phone has double minutes, then it would be 800)."
the phone can download applications from google play ?,"no, not an Android system"
"What sequence is recommended for activation, transfer and adding minutes? Would I transfer my old tracfone number and minutes first, than add 400 car",Yes 1st you want to xfer from an old phone (either trac or other) which will xfer the minutes/days remaining onto this phone.... Then IF you need to right away you can add the 400 card (which will triple to 1200). The mins/days u xfer will not triple but you will get I (I think it was) 20 mins and 60 days service just by buying this phone (added to what u xfer).... When I xfer my daughters old trac to the this new I did it via the website (tracfone).... it take about a half day to xfer the info to the new phone (she just carried both the first morning till it happened). I love her 'new' phone so much I'm getting it too!

You only have to align the phone to the charging surface, and that is not hard as there is plenty of charging surface"

I myself wouldn't chance it because the possibility of it fitting are extremely slim....

Do we still need double sided tape for the edge or just this LOCA glue would be fine?,The glue will travel to every location it can get to. I use the tape still so that the glue won't get into the rest of the phone! I have seen instances the too much glue will seep into the CPU and ruin the phone. YUes Definitely use the two sided tape and use the glue sparingly.
Can this be used with the digitizer still in the phone? Has anyone had problems with the buttons sticking after curing? - using a Galaxy S4,I used this glue to replace the glass only (digitizer still in phone) but I took out all the cameras and sensors first and used double sided adhesive tape as well. I lined the side of the digitizer as well as top and bottom. Lasted the glue on digitizer and set glass on making sure no air bubbles were inside and cured using a UV Lamp from salon edge with no problems on my S4 that I'm using to write this answer to your question. I would say to make sure no glue leaks to places you don't want it to to use the double sided glue and remove sensors and cameras prior to gluing process. Hope this helps
"How strong is this glue, will it be able to hold a lot of weight?",The glue is for screen repair. Don't know what you are wanting to use it for but phone screens do not weigh a lot. You might want to look into some kind of epoxy if you are wanting to hold weight.
What is the viscosity of this product? What are the approx. amounts to use on Galaxy S3 or S4?,Don't use stuff does not work
"Once this is hardened, does it stay rubbery? Can you go back and replace it later, or does it harden like epoxy?",No it stays rubbery just like the original glue used on the phone. Just be careful they give u enough to do about 3 large phones. Don't use it all on one phone
Would this be a good product to use to fill in a surface crack on the screen? (To stop it from spreading and make it feel less rough)?,"Don't think that this product would work to fill in or smooth out a surface crack as it was not meant to be exposed to the outside elements. Once heat or moisture builds up around this product, it can get sticky and will probably start smearing all over your screen."
how much uv glue have the syringe?,10ml in each syringe
"What kind of UV light does it require for curing? I'm not sure about the touchscreen glass, but standard glass (non quartz) blocks most UV light.",Sunlight is the best for the money.
"How much UV does this stuff need? 5 minutes, UV .25 inches away ... like rubber.","I left mine out in the sunlight (natural light contains uv) for about 10 minutes and it was fine. If you are talking about AFTER you apply it. I had a faulty package that was rubber before I ever applied it, that is no bueno!"

I dont know, if this is actually pre owned. Seller should tell it new or used. I bought it as new per the seller."
Some people are saying that the phone is not unlocked. How can I be sure that the phone will be unlocked? I'm leaving and I couldn't return it later.,Yes it's true it was not unlocked when I bought. Also I spend a lot of money trying to put a wireless and to unlocked it
would this phone work thru straight talk,Yes
"I have just money to buy a refurbished or used, it is more advisable grammed according to the experience of who and what I buy?","Hi Lizeth, this is Shaul from Ultimate Electronics. We are selling this phone as both Used and Refurbished but both are in the same condition. These phones were previously used and have since been tested and repackaged with a charger. They are in excellent cosmetic condition. I don't think you'll be disappointed!"
How can I active this cell phone in other countries?,The phone is activated thru Apple. Simply put in the activated SIM card from that country. Then go to settings&gt;general&gt;reset all settings and your should be all set
"Erin, will the 3G work on straight talk? I am buying your white iPhone 4s","If straight talk uses a SIM card, it will work it will walk with any GSM carrier ,it's iPhone 4 not 4s"

how does the built-in screen protector feel? smooth or more matt feeling? does it reflect light or attract fingerprints?,"The screen protector is smooth.

Is this for 1st generation moto x? I see older reviews but the product dimensions don't seem right. Thanks!,"It's for the first gen Moto X, they don't have one for the 2nd gen yet"
"Is the ""Red"" color as purple as the product preview shows? My favorite color is RED... not purple.","No sir it is red my dad has the ""red"" one"
Does the screen react to touch without difficulty?,The screen lays perfectly against the phone and reacts to touch just like the otter box cases do. I haven't had any trouble using the keypad. It even works great for the sliding keyboard texting (I forgot what that's called).
Will a Square credit card reader fit fully into the headphone port with the case on?,"Probably? I don't have access to the case anymore, but it's a rubber flap that can be bent back. The reader might have to sit at an angle. I could try on my Otterbox, but that's about it. :/"
Will this case also fit the Moto G? If not when or will there be a Moto G case available?,"Thank you for shopping with Hans-USA, This case not fit the moto G and we have been told by the factory that the new shipment still can not confirm. Thank you and looking forward to serving you again. Best regards, Hans-USA"
"Is the soft part so soft that it just kind of loosely flaps on the screen like ""gel"" cases, or is it more stiff against the screen?","Its not as soft as the gel cases but its not as hard as the ""gel"" part of the otterbox defender. Kind of an in between. The soft part goes all the way around the phone then the hard piece covers that. The hard stuff doesn't go all the way to the top so the edges around the screen are soft"
Does this cover any of the screen? Does it allow the Moto X to be stood on the edge for viewing videos?,The case does not cover any useable portion of the screen. There is enough of a lip that it stays on. The case won't stand up on its own but it can be leaned against something. The case material is not slippery so it won't slide.
Is the silicone part a lint magnet and hard to remove from pockets?,"Hello, Thank you for your message. The silicone part shouldn't make it hard to remove from pockets. We have sold a number of this item and haven't heard any complaints about it being a lint magnet or that it is hard to remove from pockets. Hope this helps.

Does this fit the 2nd gen Moto X?,"No it did not. I returned it and ordered Moto X Case, SUPCASE [Unicorn Beetle Series] for All New Motorola Moto X (2nd Gen.) Phone 2014 Release, Premium Hybrid Bumper Case (Black/Black)"
"I'm assuming this is for the 2014 Moto X, 2nd generation, correct?","No, Gen 1. Gen 2 is a bigger phone. Trident doesn't show a case for it yet on their website."
Do you ship to Europe? Thanks.,"Hello, Thank you for your message. Unfortunately we do not ship internationally. Thank you."
is it water poof,Nope not at all
Does the built-in screen protector make the Moto-X harder to read in the sun?,"Thank you for shopping with Hans-USA, It's a clear built-in screen protector not a mirror type.

You can see it here at AMAZON ---&gt; ""HTC One X with Beats Audio Unlocked GSM Android Smartphone - No Warranty - White"" Exactly this model... I would appreciate your help and quick response, thank you!"
Is the call quality good? Is this case bulky?,In my opinion the call quality is fine and I work offshore to where noises can be loud and I have no problem hearing. People on the other end of the line also say that the call doesn't sound muffled on my end. The case is actually quite slim. A lot smaller then an otterbox defender. Doesn't add much bulk at all.
"Does the screen protector cause any problems with the screen? I.E. sensitivity, brightness, rainbow effects, dots and stuff like that?","I have a problem with sensitivity on occasion, It's really not bad though. I recommend this phone case"
Will this case fit a Galaxy S4 with a Hyperion extended life battery which requires a slightly bigger back case than the standard battery?,"My s4 fits tightly in the case. If a battery extended a mm more, it would not fit."
"Can this case also be used for a Samsung Galaxy Active? If not, is there a Lifeproof case specifically for the Active?","This case does not work or fit the Samsung Galaxy S4 Active. There are no waterproof cases for the phone, as the phone is already waterproof and dust-proof."
will this fit my s4 #1545,Yes.
Does the case effect the sound quality?,"Call audio quality is very acceptable. That is one of the main reasons I purchased this case. Reviews for other cases mentioned muffled audio during calls. Music listening through the phone speaker is somewhat muffled. I primarily use a headset for listening to music. Overall, this is an excellent case. My phone has already experienced a heavy drop onto a hard tile floor with no damage sustained."
How easy is it to change the case? I would only use this as a weekend/vacation case. Curious if it's easy to change out on the fly.,"Very easy, takes less than a minute to remove it or reinstall it."
Is there any way to attach a cord to this case (does it have a lanyard hole)?,Yes it does
"The description for this case claims that it has a ""security tab to secure wallet items"".Where is this located? Mine does not appear to have such tab.",Mine did not have one either. I believe that's a different but similar product. They probably just gave the same description for both.
What are the measurements?,Not much bigger than the phone it is a very tight case

At what depth is the seal good for as in scuba diving?,"The case is more than sufficient for a pool or shower, maybe even day at the beach... But im honestly not positive about scuba diving.. I suppose if your not going to extreme depths were pressure is drastically increased it should be fine."
Will this work with Galaxy S4 Active?,No it wouldnt fit. But isnt it suppose to be waterproof anyway
"Does the hinge on the charging port wear out? Is it made of rubber, or is it a real hinge?",It is rubber and has shown wear from taking in and out of pocket but not from opening it.
Can a lanyard be attached to the case?,"Yes you can I have one on mine and love it, its not included in the case but I just took one off an old camera and it works great"
If you lose the waterproof adapter that comes with it is there a less expensive option to replace it even if it doesn't create a waterproof seal?,you don't deed the pig tail that comes with the case to use the head phone jack you only need it to keep it waterproof. When im at work I just plug my ear buds in the phone
Is this case similar to an otterbox?,In my opinion this case is better. I had the otterbox 1st but then people were complaining that I sounded muffled. And I had trouble hearing people as well on my end. So I did some research and found this case. Way better! No more complaints
"After the waterproof test there was some water inside the latches and along the sides of the case, but not inside. Is that normal?",Yes. It shouldn't permeate the case.
Can you use this for lap swimmimg,I used it at seaworld water park. Went down slides and pool all day with the kids taking pictures and video taping!
Does it have a built in screen protector?,In my experience the built in screen protection is top notch my phone has taken two big hits to the screen (roughly two pounds falling from a foot and a quarter at work)
Does this protect against drop damage too?,Yes. I have a toddler who has thrown my phone against the floor in this case and it had been fine.

Can this be used with the Ballistic Glass Screen Protector?,The Obex case is a completely enclosed case incliding a top notch cover for the screen. Because it fits so snug there is no room for anything else in the case
"Is this case toddler proof? My 1 year old stold my phone off the table, drooled in the charger port, and not realizing it was wet, I put it on charger and fried the phone. The insurance replacement arived today. She also made chew marks on the metal...","I really don't know for sure, but the cover for the charger port is pretty hard to open for an adult (I have cracked an acrylic nail on it more than once! Just ask my nail tech!) so I think it would be hard for your toddler to drool in there so long as you remember to close that cover. The cover for the headphone port is easier to open, though."
Will this case fit the Galaxy S5?,I don't think so because they are physically different sizes
I have decided to buy this item as soon as it comes out in White /Grey. Please let me know when it becomes available.,its available now
will fit galaxy 4 min,No
"I see that the camera, LED light, and hearing speaker are exposed. When introduced to the water will there be damage?",They are all protected by the same type of clear plastic that covers the screen. It says it will be water proof for 30 minutes up to 2 meters but I've only tested it for 20 minutes
So this is completely waterproof? I drop it in the sink and ill have no issues?,"I did the pre test in a bowl of water, with a paper towel for 30 minutes before I put my phone in it. It came out completely dry. I often text in the shower also. Don't judge. Lol. No issues with it yet. I feel safe with it but definitely do the test 1st. If it leaks during the test, they will replace or let you return it with no problem."

Does the iphone 4 stay dry in this case?,"The case isn't waterproof, but it does protect the phone from my sweat."

does it work with macbook pro?,As of now the only incompatible devices for this device are the Asus Transformer tablets and Galaxy Note 10.1.
"Stupid question, does this have removable batteries or is it an internal battery charging system? thanks","As far as I can tell, the battery is internal. It requires a cord to charge it, which is included with the purchase. Hope this helps!"

"Does this comes with at waranty? If so, how long?","Yes, the item has 12 months Limited Replacement Warranty."
"Can I charge my 17"" Dell Inspiron laptop with this?",I don't think that it would do any harm to try. I charge my Samsung Galaxy Tab S and my Moto X at the same time and It has never lost power. I would fully charge the Power Tank before hooking the Dell Inspiron to it. I like the fact that I can take it from room to room with me and charge my devices with it. Barb
Do you sel additional power cards to charge the battery itself? Cannot find mine,the unit comes with its own cord to recharge.
Will this charge an iPad 1?,"Am pretty sure it can, It has enough power to charge my Ipad Air, also an Ipad 2, it is powerful. I cant give a 100% assurance, but it managed to charge Ipads with higher processors and screen resolutions."
does it include the wall charger to charge the unit itself?,"I don't think so, I use any compatible USB wall plug (all android and apple work)"
If it comes with no AC wall charging adaptor how do you charge it,"You can use any USB wall charger (e.g., the one for your cell phone) or you can plug one end of the supplied USB cable into your computer's USB port and the other end into the PowerTank. BTW, I've been using the PowerTank for several months now, and the thing is awesome. I travel a lot, and now I won't travel without it."
What is the warrantee,"Hello Susan, The warranty is 12 months, you can go to the company website for any warranty issues."
What is difference between the two outputs as far as connecting to IPAD or IPOD or IPhone--,"the 2.1A USB is capable of charging the ipad, while the 1A USB is more suited for an iPhone. as far as iDevices go, phones and ipods and such can be charged in either port as it will only use what it needs. the ipad, however, needs to use the 2.1A USB because it needs that amperage to charge."
how long does it take to charge,I wait until its completely dead so about 6 hours
is this compatible with the nook?,I haven't tried it but I think it absolutely should be.
Can you be charging something and use the product you are charging at the same time? Will this work with the Galaxy Note 2 and the Nook Hd?,You absolutely can use the pack while charging; I do it all the time with both Iphone 5C and Aftershoks charging. Too bad the other answer was so mean-spiritted and just plain ugly. Enjoy the pack!
Does any charging cords come with this unit?,"The cord that comes with the unit has a USB plug at one end and what I believe is a Micro plug at the other (This ""Micro"" end is compatible with Samsung devices and probably many more). As long as you have a charging plug (comes with most devices these days) that the USB end of your device's charging cord plugs into, you should not need to buy any additional cords. If your device is not a Samsung, you should be able to use any device cord with this unit as long as the free end has a USB plug."
How big is this - weight and dimensions?,"Approx 9oz 4 1/2"" long, 3"" wide, 3/4"" depth"
How long does the power tank retain a charge once it is fully charged?,The description states it has lithium technology which will last many many months if it is fully charged and not being used. I'm very happy with mine and it has plenty of power to recharge phones and tablets without having to recharge the unit itself. I hope this helps.
What is difference between the two outputs as far as connecting to IPAD or IPOD or IPhone--,1 amp and 2 amp - 1 amp for iPhone and 2 amp for iPad. Not sure the amps for iPod.

"is it the same as the defender series? and is the entire phone in a protective casing, like the otter boxes hard plastic casing?","I have a defender for my iPhone 5 and an armorbox for my son's 5C. They are similar, not the same. As others have said it is a whole phone case with screen protection. The difference is the rubber exterior. The defender has a rubber sleeve that fits over the plastic case. The armorbox has rubber integrated over shock points, but not the whole phone. They both are strong and will protect against drops."

The phones were not damaged in any way."

Does it have a lip (stick out past the screen) for protection if its dropped?,Yes...looks like about a 1/8th inch protective area around the screen surface...same thing around the camera lenses...
how does it go on?,well to pull the case apart or open it you stick your index finger in the hole at the top and pull out gently. Once it's off the piece thats has a built in screen protector goes on your phone first. then once that is attached you put your phone into the second piece.

It just peels apart at the top of the case
"I have a tempered glass screen protector, will my phone still fit in case?",Yes it should.

is the screen protector similar to the lifeproof?,"Can't say...never used that product. Can say that this case is so much better than I ever expected. My new 5C is fully protected, however it works and feels just like an iPhone. Everyone I show it to is impressed."
is it easy to put the iPhone 5c in the case?,"Yes, super easy."
"Is this a ""rubberized"" case? I have a rubberized one which is nice for protection, but gets stuck when taking it in and out of my pocket.",Not rubberized! It's like a hard plastic shell. The outer edges of the phone do have a slightly rubberized coating....But seems to go in and out of pockets easily- unlike the soft rubber cases
is there a thing that covers the charging spot? or is it just open? and is it easy to use the touch screen with the cases screen on it?,Yeah. There is a charge port cover when you are not charging your phone. The built in screen protector is very nice and you can easily touch the screen with little to no pressure at all. You should deffanatly get this case.
"When the cover is on the phone, do you see the color the phone is? I'm worried that my pink phone won't match the pink protector. Thanks!",No cause my case only shows the camera area on the back the rest of the case is closed
Can you remove the built-in screen protector? I want to install tempered glass...,No it is all one piece. It would probably tear if you did. It's very thin plastic
Is the charging port big enough to be plugged in to an off brand lightning charger?,"The port is actually pretty big, so I would say yes. My off-brand fit in fine, and it was a little bit bigger than a standard iPhone lightening charger. I hope this helps!"

IS it okay to take it underwater in the ocean for like 5 minutes?,"Yes, I did it with my own phone this past week in Florida."

Is this case reliable?,It is very reliable. I love mine and would not use another case.
I bought one more for protecting it from being dropped. Voice is muffled when I try to talk is there a fix for this?,Yeah my daughter loved it when she first got it but realized you have to take the case off to charge it and you can't hear well with it on.
How to make sure it is waterproof,I wouldnt suggest testing it in water to see how well it is. The piece to cover the charger didnt fit well on mine and it wouldve gotten damaged if i tested it. Buying a $20 waterproof case might be a better choice.
How to make sure it is water proof,When u get your phone there are instructions on how to test it prior to putting your phone in this case. My daughter did the initial test and it did not leak
is it a unbreakable screen protector too or just waterproof?,I have on my iPhone 5 a Lifeproof case and is exactly the sale I would say both.
Is it really lifeproofw,it says but i would not recommend it buy a little more well known brand

Do anyone know how to reset the headphones?,Are just trying to connect to a different phone ?

MAYBE A DUMB QUESTION. does this fit a samsung s4,I have a iPhone 4s and I know Samsungs are bigger so I don't think so unless The company makes the case in different sizes because it fits my iPhone perfect
"Had for less than a month and upon drop, iphone screen is shattered. Does the product have warranty for it's protected tempered glass or phone inside?","Unfortunately; They DONT offer any type of warrantee. My original case did the SAME thing. I though it was a fluke and purchased another one. So far. So good. My first one impacted in the camera / ear sea which is not protected and needless to say, I end up kicking out $70 to have my cell phone repaired and another $16 for the replacement case.

how do i use it -- it does not come with instructions - just a crappy package that says fashion case for my love phone please help,It does come in a shady flimsy case. It also comes with good instructions and the tool needed with extra scews. It will protect your phone really good. I love my phone and this case is not a joke. The price is beyond comparison. People ask if this case was 150+. As soon as you get it it's in a bubble wrap envelope. It weighs a good amount. And the material is solid probably as hard as steel. Down side is the paint. It chips off but for 19 I can't or won't complain I love how secure it feels and is. I recommend it 101%
does it have gorilla glass,Yes
How is the photo quality when using this case?,Its very good I love this case and there is no ubstruction to flash or lens

"When i make calls with this case on my phone people say they can hear a ""echo""on their end. Is there a way to solve this?","No there is lots of problem with this case, mine would never charge fully cause the case wouldn't allow the plug to go all the way in and connect, took case off and phone now charges fully. Never had echo problem but this case has given me lots of problems wish I never purchased it."
does it come with a clip,No clip .
how can I pick the color fornthe case I want ?,"Place the order and contact the seller requesting your color. Yep, it's dumb but they made it that way.

It has only 3 subject lines to pick from, but you'll be able to type a message by choosing ""Thank you"" or ""Invoice Request""."
will it work for iphone 5c?,No it will not... You need the 5c version not 4 & 4s version.

ECO-FUSED Handmade Faux Leather Classic Book Series Case for Samsung Galaxy S4 S Iv I9500. will this Case fit the Galaxy 4 Note (Edge),"I'm 99.9% certain it won't. The Note seems too large. Here's the link I found the dimensions: http://www.phonearena.com/phones/compare/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-4,Samsung-Galaxy-S4/phones/8577,7597"
I have a SG4 model #SCHI545 Verizon (It is the standard model). Will this work?,yes any samsung S4...
"Is the Encyclopedia word, printed on the front, actually crooked like in the pic?","I got the thesaurus version, and it's perfectly straight. I've had an iPhone case and my brother got one as well - they're well-made and neatly designed. That said, it's not very comforting that the print on the picture is so off."
Will you be making this case for the new Galaxy Note 4 coming out?,"Hi Carly, We have no communications in regards to this matter yet. Please contact us through the link below to discuss this further."
Will this case fit my SG4 Active?,I'm not sure; look at the dimensions of an SG4 and compare. It fits my SG4 like a glove.
Works on Samsumg Galaxy S3mini? I need to buy additional cable? Thank you.,"If you have a standard usb cord that fits your Samsung unit, you can plug the usb port directly in to the PowerBot. If you do not have one, you will most likely have to buy a separate cord. Unit comes with a variety of adapters, but since I do not have Samsung unit, do not know if there is one that will fit or not."

"how do i get this thing to stay on, like an idiot i threw away the instructions - i can turn it on, but it never STAYS on for more than 4 seconds.",this is a different model than I have. I would imagine you could look up the specs on the powerbot website? or try holding the button down for a few seconds longer.
How long will it take to completely charge this power bank ?,I usually do it overnight but probably mostly charged within 3 hours.
"The blue charging light seems confusing as it sequences. When I unplug the charging cable, and press the button nothing happens. Defective?",Are you trying to charge the PowerBot or trying to charge a device from the PowerBot? You need to change the in put and out puts for these two different tasks. When I received my unit from Amazon it had a charge not full but the Blue light came on straight out of the package
Can it be carried as a carry on on flight? Normally batteries are not allowed. It will be a great help if my music player dies down during 24 hour flights.,I've brought this (and several other similar powerbanks like the Anker and Lepow moonstone) on flights within the U.S. with no problem.
I let it charge for about 5hours when I took it off the charge to test it on my galaxy note 3 phone. It does nothing! I short pressed. help?,"Not sure if this will help ,but when you short press the blue lights on top should light (telling you how much power is left)and the screen on your phone should light up with a notification saying 'charging'anyway that's what Galaxy S4 and Nexus7 both do.If this isn't happening ,then you might have a faulty one( which does happen)Any case I would try to contact the seller and ask them if they could possibly give you any suggestions or return for exchange it."

I haven't updated my iOS yet in my 5 and it still chages fine from multiple chargers . It sounds like the car charger that came with thst might have failed . Some chargers use a fuse in the plug that fits into a 12V socket. That's where I would start assuming that the phone charges properly on other chargers (110V)"
"So it says Otterbox defender, what about Otterbox preserver case?",When it says defender it means it. No wiggle room for a different case.
"The pictures how it in landscape mode, but does it rotate so it can be viewed physically in portrait?","Yes, there is a swivel knuckle."
Does it work with iPhone 5c?,Yes. But this must be used with an otter box case for iPhone 5 versions. Otherwise the space you clip the phone I to us too large. Other phones are too small and will fall out of holder.

"is this really 22 inch long or it is smaller? I want to use this in 2006 toyota sienna, is this going to be tall enough?",It is 22 inches and is a good length for most cars.

Hope this helps.
Does the top left leg cover the aux jack port on the Galaxy S4 ?,U can move all 4 legs were ever u want
"Can it fit Kindle Paperwhite which is 6""?","No I don't believe it will support a 6"" object. I have a Galaxy note 2 in an Otterbox which it does fit but has little room to spare. It is about 3 inches wide so half as much as your Kindle Paperwhite."

Can we use other in-line microphone earphone/earbud with this Bluetooh Headset and use earbud's micrphone instead of Bluetooth Headset?,According to one review. It is output audio only. The mic is built into the device.
is this compatible with iphone 5s?,"This item is built for Android phones, and offers an Android app to download with it. However, it is Bluetooth, so it will work fine with the iPhone 5S. Features like reading your text messages will not function with an iPhone. You can make and listen to calls, listen to music - the song title will display fine as well. Hope this helps."
Can I use/connect to a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 that wll be used as a phablet(phone and tablet)?,"I only connected it to a Xperia phone and tablet as well as a windows 8.1 laptop. And although the specifications say that it is compatible to any bluetooth enabled cellphone, but it doesn't say anything about which functions won't work since it uses the Sony exclusive ""Smart Connect"" android application.

"Has anyone tested this device for RFI? Near AM-BC, SWL, &amp; VHF-UHF receivers?",I am a Ham Radio Operator and I have not had any problems with it using RF from 1.8 Mhz to 450 Mhz. Our microwave is about 10 feet from the device and no ill effects have been noted. There are three TV Station transmitters and two FM transmitters located within 5 miles of me. No problems noticed here yet. I have had the device for about three weeks.
Will this be compatible with all outlet cables? Don't want my outlet to be burned because of over flow of current.,It is only 36 watts -- equivalent to a very low power lamp. I would not be concerned.
"Have read Apple and Android use different techniques for charging; Android follows int'l standard, Apple doesn't. This explain the labels on charger?","The label and the reason is explained in the Anker product page: USB-charged devices look for a USB pin signal before they accept a full-speed charge. Most devices use a standard USB pin signal; Apple devices and a few others, like the Galaxy tab, require specialized pin signals. Our Android and Apple ports are hard-wired to accommodate these two types of charging authentications. However, an Apple device can (usually) still charge from an Android port and vice versa, sometimes at a slower speed, but oddly, often also at full speed. - See more at: http://www.ianker.com/product/71AN3654W-WA#sthash.S4I7jfEF.dpuf"
If I plug only 1 tablet into this charger will the adapter devote all 36 watts to it or is it 8 watts per port? I need at least 24 watts to charge.,no chance . 8 watts per port

No overcharge protection?,"According to our product team, all our chargers have a chip inside to prevent overcharge your device. If you can't unplug your device at once after fully charged, there is little effect on your device in normal status.

Thus, in the long term safety consideration of electronic device, we suggest you unplug your device after fully charged. Really appreciated your understanding towards this matter."

can it charge 2 iphones and 2 ipad,"It has 2 ports that specifically say iPhone or iPad. These ports charge the devices quickly. The other 2 ports are for other devices, i.e., Kindle, wireless keyboard. They do charge the Apple products but very slowly so I wouldn't recommend."

Does it fit an Iphone 5?,It fits an iPhone 5C

Do you have any issues plugging in headphones with this case?,"zero. the cutout is plenty big enough for every 1/8"" plug I've tried so far. If you have a particularly wide plug you may have a slight issue, but you can fit more than the standard apple earbud into the port."
Will this case work with the 5s?,No. This case is for the iPhone 5C.
Does the blue case match the color of the blue iphone 5c?,"No, the Dodger Blue color of the case does not match the blue of the iPhone perfectly. It is several shades off. But the case covers so much of the phone, that it is not noticeable. Only the small holes for the camera lens and the switch to mute the phone reveal the iPhone's true color. The Dodger Blue case is actually a more attractive shade of blue to me than the iPhone itself."
My phone is slippery. Does this case help with that?,I believe it does. The iPhone without the case was hard to hold for me. This case isn't like rubberized all around - just the black parts on top and bottom and the volume buttons - but I have no problems hanging on to it.
is this case waterproof?,"no, it is not waterproof, it is a hard/soft bumper encasement what that means is that it surrounds the outer edge of the iphone with emphasis on protecting the corners where, if the phone is dropped without protection, the screen will shatter as it bounces on the corners of the phone."

Does the Verizon 5ciPhone fit in this case . I have heard that there Re differences between it and the AT&amp;T version.,"Mine is a verizon 5c and it fits great. I think the difference is between the 5c and 5s, not necessarily the carrier."
Can you see any of the phone color with the case on? Just curious if I need to coordinate colors or if the case is all you see.,You can see the area around the camera lens and the orientation lock toggle.
How protective is that case? do I still need to put the iPhone in an additional bag/case or can I just throw it in my purse? without scratching it?,Wasn't everything I thought it would be still need a screen protector
Do the openings fit third party plugs?,Yes they do
What does the case feel like? I imagine it's not as slippery as the iPhone is by itself?,"True, however it is also not sticky and slides in and out of pockets easily. The black rubber parts at the top and bottom are not sticky at all and nothing sticks to it as well. The metal slate middle part is smooth and again, slides easily. In my opinion, this is a 100% perfect case. I have had cell phones since the huge bag phones and many cases. This one tops them all. Ordered a Spigen Tough Armor case for my wife's new phone as well."
does this case scratch off too easily?,It does scratch but the color stays clear and you can't tell it's scratched unless you are trying to find a scratch and were I gave the blue one it may show up more or less

Will the Square credit card reader work with this case (it doesn't with my Otter Box Defender)?,"That was one my concerns as well. My square fits perfect, no obstruction at all. I'm very happy with the case."
Will a AUX cord or other head phones besides the apple head phones fit?,Yes
Does it come whole (no separate pieces from different places).,It does come altogether but there is rubber and plastic
does it protect from screen cracking,"Yes, I have dropped my phone a quite a few odd angles on concrete, tile, and brick, and each time it gets away without a scratch. I hope this helps!"

Will an aftermarket Lightning cable like the AmazonBasics USB to Lightning cable fit in this case's charging opening?,Yes
Is the charging hole large enough for the AmazonBasics USB A to Lightning compatible Cable?,"Yes, it will fit through the case. Be sure the connecting cable is for the model IPhone you have. I purchased a case specifically for an IPhone 5c... Check if both case and lightning compatible cable are compatible with your model IPhone. You won't go wrong with buying the case...."
when will this be back in stock?,Have not dropped phone on concrete or anything at this point but this case appears to be well built. It has a soft inner shell and hard outter shell. This should provide protection for hard drops and the soft inner shell should provide some bounce.

Does this fit a US Cellular iphone 5c also?,Yes

Is the purple case a true purple color or is it a fuschia color?,Fushcia
Is the face of the phone covered with the black panel as shown in the picture?,No that black part is on the back. It is made of a harder plastic and the white part is rubbery. I have 4 kids and this case has kept it from shattering numerous times.
Is the headphone jack accessible?,"Everything is accessible, headphone jack, ringer/silence switch, charge port, speaker, microphone...volume and lock buttons have a raised area for use through silicone cover."
Does this case fit only the 2013 model of 5C?,I got mine last year and it fits fine.. ??
Does this fit the Iphone 5C or the Iphone 5?,I have the 5c and it fits perfectly
Is the front also protected? I am most concerned with dropping and shattering the front glass.,"The front part - (white part shown in this photo) is rubbery & does wrap around the front edges of the phone. I think it protects it pretty well, I tend to place my phone screen down pretty frequently & I find that this case protects it pretty well. I would totally buy this again. Hope this helps!"

will it work with bluetooth of a ipod 4th generation,Yes it will. This speaker is an amazing buy.

Can I listen to music while charging?,I do and I never have any problem
"using bluetooth, will it play while sitting in the cupholder of a car?",yeah of course. I've played it in my pocket while my phone was in my other pocket.
"Does its speakerphone function okay in the car? Device looks ideal to place in a car's cup holder, but the Mic is apparently located on the bottom.",I wouldn't know because I'm only using it in a room. The mic is pretty powerful. You might want to try it and if it doesn't work out you can return it. This company seems really aimed to please. Im really happy with it. I can't complain. Hope this helps!
Do I need to change the batteries?,"No, the batteries in the Modre are lithium (the same as in our power banks) so you can just recharge the Modre and it will be good to go."
"What if the lithium battery can't be charged, is battery replaceable?","I don't think so. It appears to be self contained and out of reach, much like an iPad battery. I personally wouldn't worry about it too much for a speaker at this price point."
"Is the Aux port used to output sound that I stream to the Modre, or Is it used as an input alternative to bluetooth?",Not quite sure if the Aux port can be use to output sound. But it can be used as an input alternative to bluetooth for sure.
How long do these headphones hold a charge?,I have yet to drain the headphones. I have taken them to the gym and used them with 2 hours of constant use listening to Pandora and they battery was still above 80%. Math would say 10 hours of constant use. They aren't the most comfortable of headsets so 2 hours is about all I could stand to wear them.
How do you turn on the headset?,"I had the same problem. It says to push Bluetooth button, but there aren't any labels lol I pressed & held the middle button until I heard a beep & saw the flashing green lights. Same process to turn off."
I Just bought it and paired with my Samsung 4. Worked perfect to answer phone calls but I cant listen to any music stored on my phone. Any special ins,That's weird I bought it and it works perfectly for music with my S4

But actually when I tried to put in a code I couldn`t figure it out usually it is simple something 1234 but that didn`t work. S o if some one else knows I would like to know also. Now if you mean can you use it with another wireless company, I think it setup as a tracfone only."
Does this phone include triple minutes for the life of the phone?,"Yes, It does"
so it does NOT come with sim card? or it DOES?,"Yes it does, mine did!! I thought the same thing, but sure enough, it DID come with one."

can i unlock this phone?,Do not know.
Does it contains box- packing too?,yes!
"If I purchase this phone at this price, do I get the box and all the accessories that comes with it?","Assuming the phone is sold as-new through Amazon, I'd say it's a good bet you're getting everything that's supposed to come with it in the box. Just be sure you see the word ""new"" as opposed to ""used"" or ""refurbished."""
i wonder if the hot spot actually works? i know u gotta add an additional 10 dollars but i don't know if the phone really has the capability??,No this phone does not have the wireless hotspot capability

"I already have a boost plan, when i purchase thi phone, should i take nit to boos to unlock this device? am i going to have any probems?",No. Just call customer care as long as it's a boost phone

Can I buy a belt clip for this case?,"It doesn't appear to have any way to attach a belt clip to this particular model. However, I did notice several other cases that come with a belt clip and/or kickstand. Check out more styles to find them."
"How's the texture? I don't want slippery, something that grips, but comes in/out of pocket without turning pocket inside out/ pulling rubber off case","it is actually duel textured, the colored area is a harder plastic with less grip but the black area is a more rubber texture.

Does this product come with a belt clip?,It doesn't but it does come with a loop for a lanyard

Is this case waterproof?,No
Does this item come with any type of clip or holster?,No it doesn't come with a clip and honestly I'm not sure if it has one u can purchase separately. But I'm looking on my phone case now and no where do I see any little slits in the case where u could even clip a clip or holster into the case.

Is this Gorilla Glass like the S4 comes with?,No
The glass by itself has adhesive or I have to stick the glass with the pre-cut adhesive that is in the kit?,"Well, if you haven't removed your cracked glass yet, you will need a heat gun and plastic pry tools and/or molybine super thin wire to separate glass from LCD screen. Very tedious job that needs patience or else you will ruin LCD. If you have a LCD already new with no glass on it, the correct way to put new glass on is with liquid UV loca glue just like it's done from the factory. You can youtube how to do that. If you don't want to use uv glue, you can go easy route and just put the adhesive glass comes with at the top and bottom and the thin pieces on the sides. Be sure not to have any on the actual LCD as it will show when you put glass on.. It's not the rite way but will work. Just the touch function will not work at it's best like uv liquid loca glue that fills gap between LCD and glass.. You can dry the uv liquid glue with a uv black light or uv led flashlight or leave in sun for 30 minutes at a time checking it's dryness. Any questions just email me at AppleRepairMan27@gmail.com"
"Do I use the entire adhesive or just the outside edge? If inside also, how can I attach it without creating air bubbles?","Just use the outside edge. Be very careful and take your time and it will look like a new phone. This is not a screen saver. The material it very sticky and hard to handle. If you get in a hurry your going to miss it up. Use only the outside edge. Again take your time and you will have a new phone. I really like the out come of phone, even though I got finger prints on the inside of the screen. I got in a hurry. Not the kits fault. I am ordering another kit now that I am confident in what I am doing. A hot air gun to heat the old adhesive up is a must. Again take your time. If you have any questions contact me."
Does this package have the full screen adhesive?,"2 sided tape. I didn't use it for the full screen, just the sides"
Do I put Adhesive on the glass itself or just the thin lines around it ?,Just the thin line around it. But after a few weeks it came loose at one corner. It could use the adhesive. This is my 3rd glass and the frame is kinda bent up so got to consider that also.

is there a slot for the headphones at the bottom?,"Yes, there is"
I have a speck candy grip case on my 5c--will this fit in the armband?,I don't know exactly what a speck candy grip case is because I use my 5c without a case. But I will say that the 5c fits in the armband pretty snugly and I'd say that a case probably won't fit. It's best without a case for easy insertion/ removal. Hope this helps!

"So, is this truly an over the head style, and how does it work in a Gym?","It's not over the head style. It's over the ear. And, as you can see from its picture, is not stereo. For me, the device stays snugly on my ear even when I bike. I have run with it on over short distances and it doesn't come loose or fall out. It's light enough and snug enough that I think it will be okay for a gym workout although I can't really say how it would hold up for an aerobics or dance class or any activity that requires jumping or acrobatic moves."
how far can the headset be from my iphone to still work???,Thanks for your question. About 30 feet.
Is it compatible with the IPhone 4,Yes. It is one one the compatible devices listed.

"Which Iphone 5 is it, a 5c or a 5s?",This is a little off subject but I purchased one of these prepaid phones and the seller hadn't fully paid phone off and it was blacklisted. Caution when purchasing iPhones from secondary market. Amazon stepped in to help but I almost lost hundreds of dollars! The one I received was a 5c but this doesn't specify.

can i put it in a pool and not get my iphone wet and destroyed?,It is possible. Though I didn't try it to see if it was effective. It did seem pretty air tight as long as all the parts were in place.
"Hello, i ordered this case April 3d and i would like to know if it comes with purple and pink because in the picture has both of them in it.",When I ordered it for my wife it was pink. It says up at the top that it is pink.

Is it a good waterproof device,It's ok!
"I just ordered this case, but one of my friends said that she knew someone who got the same case for the same price and it broke immediately.

Does this case fit on iphone 4/4s or it only works for 5/5s?,Iphone 4
"Are you supposed to be able to ""use"" your phone when this thing is one? It fits fine. It's a little hard to remove - but NO ONE can hear me if I call.","I bought three cause it was a ""good deal"" but everyone i talked to said it sounded like i was under water, so i gave them all away. The case i had before was a lifeproof case. it worked fine, but it was expensive."
where is it coming from,Purchased on line. Shipped from China.
I already have T-Mobile services. Will this phone work for my old sim card?,depends on whether your old sim card is a micro sim card or regular sized sim card. Mine was the regular sized card and the tmobile store folks moved my sim card info over to the new micro sim card and installed it for me. Worked like a charm.
Will this phone let me move my Apps to SD?,"There's only 16gig internal memory, no micro sd card/external memory slot."

Are these sweatproof?,"Mine died in about 6 months of regular use at the gym. I suspect it's due to sweat. Here's their product site. Despite being called ""Active2"", it doesn't really mention anything about using it in a ""active"" lifestyle. Just generic bluetooth usability. http://www.brightechshop.com/products/item/2/active2tm-bluetooth-headset-headphones Another issue I had that lead to it dying was that it wouldn't hold a charge for more than a day. Even if I charged it and didn't use it for a day, it wouldn't turn on or only last a few minutes. I had to charge it day of use which was annoying. I've tried contacting them through their site to replace my pair and never got a response. If you're going to use it primarily for workouts/exercise, I'd recommend buying one specified for that activity. If you're still wondering, yes, they worked fine while new. Since they're just earbuds essentially, I did have some issues with it getting loose while running so now I prefer bluetooth headphones with some kind of canal or over the ear support for stability."
The headphones come with a USB charger. Can you charge them from a regular 110v wall outlet with a compatible adaptor plug?,"Yes, I have 2 pair and they will charge with the USB adapter. They also will charge with a phone charger as well."
"How do you invoke the warranty? Can't find a phone, email or anything. 3 year warranty is great if one can actually use it. ??","I have no idea how to invoke the warranty. My solution was contacting the seller via AMAZON.com for a refund by having sent it back. As you implied, essentially, the unit is not very well documented. I bought the Creative WP 250 Bluetooth head set (which I use with the Creative Zen Bluetooth player which could explain the compatibility given they're bot Creative products. The point is I couldn't get this set to pair with my unit. The process of returning anything with Amazon is very simple. That's what I suggest. The WP 250 headset is only $11 or 12 dollars more. It doesn't cost anything to replace the merchandise you have. Amazon will e-mail you a pre-paid mailing label. Hope this answers your question."
Anyone compared this Active 2 headphones vs the Jlab Go Bluetooth wireless? thanks,"The ones with the same design? Can't speak from experience, but while they look cooler being black with that pattern, the battery is stated as 5 hours between charges (I can easily get 7 or more on my active 2 playing Pandora with a few short calls, non stop) and the others are more expensive, at least for now. Three other people saw me with mine at work, all bought a pair, all have loved them for running, working, weight lifting etc."
What is the quality of the microphone like for calls?,It's OK hearing is good. Talking in ok
Can you use these while swimming?,I wouldn't suggest it. The fit isn't that secure and I'm unsure the components are waterproof
Do Brightech-Active2 pair well with a Toshiba Satellite P855-S5321 laptop Windows 8?,if your laptop has bluetooth then yes. it should being a newer one
Is there a button on the headphones to answer calls with without reaching for the phone?,"Yes, a short press of the power button answers the phone. If you are looking into these headphones, I would also look at the Alpatronix HX200 Active In Ear Stereo Bluetooth Earphones. They are a bit more durable. They do have less battery life though. I had to request a replacement set of headphones as the buttons weren't super durable and are hard to maneuver without small fingers. My replacement has worked for me so far (4months)"
How far will the wireless continue to work ?,It is typical of these headsets: needs a clear line of sight to the connected device and then you can walk about 10 to 20 ft. away and maintain a signal.
Are they compatible with the Note 4 ? Thanks,Yes
Do the headphones sit on your ears or completely around them?,Not quite all the way around the ear. They touch a little bit. They are great head phones.
is it good for working out,"I haven't tried that, though I did use it while laying out a brick walk in the fall. Jarring the headset made no difference in the sound, and I didn't notice that my ears got uncomfortably sweaty. Those are the two issues I would be worried about."
How can you tell when it is charging? Is there supposed to be a light visible while charging? How can you tell when it is fully charged?,When the light turns red; it's charging. When the light goes off; it's fully charged. Hope that helps.
Does this have a charger that plus into the wall,No. It has a usb adaptor only because it uses a round charging plug.
does it come with a charger,Yes. It's a USB charger. no home dock with it though. Computer use or other home docks work fine.
CAN BUY A REPLACEMENT CHARGER,Yes
Do these work with a Kindle fire HD?,Not sure sine I don't own a kindle fire. If it has bluetooth it should
Is there a recommendation for an adapter that will pair well with this for a portable DVD player w/o bluetooth?,No

Can someone make a clear and confident statement about if this product fits your ears INSIDE of the cups? not being ON the ears like most do?,"They fit over my ears, not on them. If a person has larger ears the fit could be close, but they cover my ears fine."
my grandson doesn't think these will work with his Ipod the description says they are compatible anyone know if they will work? for streaming music?,Hi. I bought one a few months ago...it streams with my ipad and samsung galaxy. It does fit over the ear. Battery last for hours. Great buy.
will these survive daily abuse?,Mine seem pretty well designed and made but I don't know if used heavily on a daily basis. Mine are used only 4 or 5 times a week.
"Is this really compatible with Ipad4 Retina? I've wasted money on two headsets that indicated they were compatible, but will not pair with my Ipad4",I'm not sure. It pared with my iPhone which is the 5. Hope this helps.
"Some b/t headphones do not have good sound w/the calls-What is the call sound transmission/reception quality like, can callers hear you well?","Very good, overall. Currently, I have no complaints about call quality nor is the person on the other end constantly asking me to repeat myself."
what's size?is it Appropriate For big head Can make it Wider???,"You can widen it some, but it'll be a tight fit."
Do the headphones go completely over the ear for some ambient noise reduction or do they sit on the ear which offers no isolation?,"They fit completely (and comfortably) over my ear and I cannot even hear myself talk while wearing them. I would imagine if someone has larger ears, they might be a little more snug but would still sit over."
Are they compatible with windows phones?,"If the phone has a 'bluetooth' compatibility, then it should."
What is the quality of the microphone.. sensitivity ?,"From my experience, the quality was great. I've asked a couple of people I'd talked with how I sound and they barley noticed the difference."
Will these block out outside noises such as a lawn mower?,Yes
I read in the reviews that Spigen plans to update their future cases with a hole in the back for the AT&amp;T microphone.. has that been updated?,There is a hole on the back of mine that does not line up with anything on my Sprint phone. I assume this is the hole you are talking about?
Am I reading this correctly that this case is only for international versions of the phone? Thanks in advance,It works good on my LG g3 bought in the United States
"are the cases I order now, have The microphone hole in them now, or should I wait for updated cases ?","It has all the holes and cutouts for your sensors and mic, etc.. EDIT we have the T-Mobile version. Can't say ATT won't be the same but I cannot see why it would be different."
Will you be coming out with a verizon version?,"Hello Albert, Thank you for your interest in Spigen SGP! We do not have any definite plans to release a Slim Armor Case for the LG G2 Verizon version. Please check our direct Spigen website at www.Spigen.com for any updates about our products!"
"Does it fit the Verizon version or not, seems to be some say it does.","it fits to version of LG G2 (2013)! i found this on the specifications of the product: ""Compatible with ONLY AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and International version of LG G2 (2013)"" :)"
Are the sides slick feeling? I don't want to be dropping it just because there are no grips or silicone on the side...,"It does not have any rubber to add additional grip to the sides. That said, I have not felt that it was overly slick either. It is solid plastic though so I'm sure that given the right conditions it could become slippery."
I already ordered one but where can I find the interchangeable outer shell? I wanna change mine to a different color.,No place that I know of. Just return the case you bought or order another in the color you want and trade the outer shell out.
does it fit to d802?,yes. ihave one.
Will this case fit a Canadian Telus version of the LG G2?,"I think so, but im not sure"
"Will it fit a Verizon version, i can't image that the shape of the phone would change between carriers.","No, it did not fit. The Verizon battery is larger than the other carriers for the lg g2"
does it havbe a kick stand,No it does not.
"Why does the title say ""International ONLY""? International to what? The US? So can you not order this in the US?",Dont know. I live in colorado and bought it
Has Spigen already updated the case to include a hole for the rear mic without having to drill a hole for it? Thanks.,It has been updated
Do you deliver your product in France ?,on the website it does but there's a extra shipping fee
When it says international only on the name-does this mean those in the US should not buy this cell phone case?,It works on all cell providers that carry this phone it says it wont work with Verizon version but i have had no trouble with mine
"Will this case fit Verizon version? Also, can you charge phone on wireless pad charger with cover on? Thank you","Hello Ryan, Thank you for your interest in Spigen SGP! The LG G Slim Armor will not fit the Verizon version of the LG G2. Also, the wireless pad charger will not work with the case on."
Does this case works with LG G2 D803?,"Yes, it will. The only LG G2 it won't work with is the VS980."
How much protection does it provide from ear height drops? (5-6ft) since the tough armor is advertised for protection but not the slim.,"Check out this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyI0Ge9cnqI The Slim Armor performs pretty well in this test, but will probably hold up far better in real-world scenarios."
why doesnt it fit the verizon model? All of the G2's have the same dimensions and overall size!!!!,"Nope, The Verizon version is slightly bigger than all the other versions of the G2."
"Does protect the front screen, like with a bumper?",Yes like a bumper. I can lay my phone face down and not hurt the screen.
what is the thickness of the case? Thanks,App1/8 inchang des no noticable tickets and has saved phone several times
Do i get the slate or the red?,It looks like you may be posting your question under the entry for the Slate Case SGP10538. The Red Case is SGP10537.
has the issue with the mic hole on the at&amp;t model been fixed?,Yes. All ports are accessible.
"If I buy it, will it come with all the five collors to change when I feel like it, or do I have to chose one of the collors when I buy it?",It only comes in one color
Why does the description say international only?,"Hello Christopher, I have the T-Mobile variant of this phone the LG D801 which isn't the international version. The case fits just fine. It definitely doesn't only fit the international version."
"According to the reviews, the case covers up the rear microphone near the camera/flash. Will this case ever be made with a pinhole for that mic?","Hello Ryan, Thank you for your interest in Spigen SGP! We will be having a pinhole for the mic! For our past customers for the LG G2 Slim Armor, we will be sending them an updated version of the case very soon!"
Is there enough TPU material around the unused slot in the upper right corner to protect the phone from an impact there or is this a big flaw?,Just enough to do the job.
Will this fit verizon's model?,No it will not fit.
Does this attract a lot of finger prints?,"not very many, they are pretty hard to see, but I also have the white case so that's a factor as well."
There is a version of this case without the antenna's hole in the upper right corner?,"I don't know if they make one w/o. Mine has a small hole in the top right. I have really enjoyed my case. I had an otterbox before. This is much cleaner, goes in and out of my pocket much easier. I also bought the tempered glass screen saver from PThink. I have ordered a case and cover for my wife's phone as I like mine so well. Good luck!"
how do I tell the difference from AT&amp;T and Verizon. I just bought mine from Plateeu,"There is no difference since it only has 3 buttons on the back of the phone. The case will make no difference. When in doubt, google it."
I would like to buy this product but since I have the AT&amp;T version of the LG G2 I need to know if the mic hole update as been made. Also what screen protector would you recommend?,"I don't know about the mic,but i don't recommend this case,if the screen brake you can not use the phone."
Is this compatible with the LG G2 ArmorSuit Screen Protector (case friendly version)?,"Never heard of that screen protector, but this case is not very intrusive on the screen so I would imagine so. I very much like mine, and would recommend this case."
Is it compatible with lg g2 D802? what about the mic?,I am a sales rep for Sprint and apparently it'll work with all LG G2s except for Verizon Wireless'. As VZW's G2 has wireless charging capability so it has a slightly different design. I have had no issues with the fit and mic.
Is this case waterproof or water resistant?,I believe it is water resistant.
how fast is shippping,7-12 days
Fits galaxy s3?,Yes... it fits and works real good.
"I got my pone in hong kong, how do I know if is compatible with your case it sais is a LG D 802 is this like the T mobile or the AT&amp;T ? thanks",As long as the phone is the same as a LG G2 it will work.. The only phone that won't work with this case is the verizon G2 phone..
It glides well in the pocket? How thick is it?,"No it wont glide and I don't know about the thickness I mean it does add a little bulk but any case will do that, at least any case that's worth having on your phone to protect it. This one is very stylish some people told me that they thought it was part of the phone."
Has the Microphone issue in the back of the case been addressed Yet?,addressed and fixed
"Does it provide any grip, the case looks like it would be very slick?","It's looks slippery at first glance, but the plastic backing is significantly less slippery than the back of the LG G2 without a case. The only reason this case would be really slippery is if your hands were wet."
"Hi, does the case fit to lg g2 d805?",Fits perfect love it
What Screen-protector do you use and how well does it work? :) Thanks!,I use an Obliq screen protector and have had it on for 3 months with no issue.
Verizon,What
"It says international only in the description, will this fit my AT&amp;T LG G2 from the United States?",Yes. It will fit international and all other models except for the Verizon version
The at&amp;t version has mic above the flash and in the pictures it looks like it is blocked by this case. Will it work?,"The pictures there was the old version of the case, the new one will have another hole right where the mic at. It will work, don't worry."
will the international version fit the Sprint version of the LG G2?,I would think so. It fits the T-Mobile version (mine) and most case makers group the sprint and T-Mobile phones together.
vs. otterbox?,"I was an Otterbox fan untill I my last Otterbox case actually cracked and broke after a few months which caused my iphone to slip and fall to the ground and crack. hence me having the S4 now. I think it's a pretty good ""cheap"" alternative to an Otterbox as long as you can keep up with the hex screwdriver use to close the case and have no issues with your phone weighing several extra .oz because of the pure mass of the heavy duty phone case.Plus Otterbox doesn't come with Gorilla Glass for your screen.But as of today I'm still extremely happy with this case....."
Does this case protect the camera lens?,Yes but dont push to hard on the outside protective glass or it will pop out
"I own a Samsung Galaxy S4 (Sprint Model # SPH-L720), will this case fit my phone..??",Yes looks huge but it fits
"I see it says Gorilla Glass in the title, is it really Gorilla Glass--seems like some reviewers have their doubts. Touch screen still very reactive?",Dear buyer:there are two screen.one is Gorilla Glass.another is Touch screen.we send to you is the Gorilla Glass.thanks
Will this fot the Note 3 from Samsung?,No I wish that is why I bought it for my husband. I unfortunately have to return it.
Does it come with the Sword? My kids dared me to ask.,Unfortunately Mr. Long it does not. But kuddos to you for asking&#128515;
How long is the warranty?,Its the biggest piece of crap I ever bought on amazon.... Don't bother.
This case came up in my inquiry for a case for the Note 3. Does this fit?,No too small. It just fits S4. it's a great case for the s4 but it does kind of kill your phone signal. But like I said no it does nIt fit the note
will this work underwater in a pool for taking photos and videos?,NO. This case is NOT waterproof.
Do you have a belt clip holster for this case?,It's not designed for a holster.
"Hi, I&acute;m looking for a thin and accurate pen that may work on a sony tablet Z1 and I liked this one. Can this be helpful for my needs? Rgds","There is a disk at the end of the pen, so the point is not thin, but since the disk is transparent you can see the pen point and it is very accurate. I will suggest you purchase extra points though as the disk is somewhat fragile. Additionally, if your tablet screen protector causes any drag, you'll find this useless (unless you're willing to remove said screen protector)."
I have never owned a stylus like this. Why are the tips a consumable product? Do they wear down? Break off? Thanks in advance.,"They don't wear down. They can break off but if you don't apply pressure, there is no need to worry. I frankly am not that enthusiastic about them because you can control the width of lines in most apps anyway."
Does one have to hold the stylus vertically to write or tap? What does the disc do?,"I am using my tablet and the Musemee Notier V2 to write this. You do not have to hold it vertically to write or tap, provided that you apply adequate pressure to the pen. This will depend on how big your hands are and where you hold the pen. Apply enough pressure at any angle and your device should pick up the tip of the stylus. The disk on the top is to make sure your capacitive screen can pick up the tip. I love the pen."
"Does this stylus come with a cap? The third picture suggested it did, though it was not in the package when it arrived",It doesn't come with a cap but it unscrews and screws back together with the stylus tip inside the barrel (protected better than a cap)
Can i Use this on an android tablet,"It works with my android phone moto x, I don't have a tablet"
does it work well with a screenprotector? if so- which brand is it compatible with?,It works fine with my screen protector I don't know what brand it is but I have a life proof case on my phone and it works with that screen protector as well.
does it work on touch screen laptops,I got it for my iPad and it works great

Is it restrcited in any form? I have 80 nodes on my network.,"I do not believe any new SonicWALL TZ device has restricted nodes like they used to before. all TZ100-TZ215's that I have used are unrestricted. You must register them with SonicWALL (Dell) of course so, your licenses are synced up with them. after that, you should be unrestricted. the only node limitation woudl be hardware or processor limitation in that the TZ215, for example, can handle up to 48000 connections."

"will this work on a lg. bh9431pw, 1460w blue ray home theatre system, for plugging in head phones in the front?","As long as your electronic device has a USB audio input, it will work on basically anything. All it does it allows you to utilize your audio signals as you see fit. For example, in my case (I am a drummer) I simply plug it into one of my many music laptop audio USB inputs and I could use a microphone, headphone, etc. But I primarily used mine to record output audio signals from my laptop music software. I also use it to reroute signals to my Amps and speakers to record music from the built in audio software in my electronic drum kit. I in addition use it to record output signals from microphones positioned in front of my speakers. I don't see any reason why you couldn't use it on your device. Just plug it into your USB audio output on your device and stick in your headphone, it should work."
"It says ""7.1 Channel Sound"", but it doesn't seem to default to 7.1. The only option available is stereo. Any suggestions? (Win7)",It is crap.......normal sound too it cannot process.
will this work on a wii game system,"There is a good possibility it would. It is a ""driverless"" device, and even works on my IPAD. I cannot say 100% yes however. Given the price, I would take a chance."
I just got this in the mail. Do I have to download a program to get it to work? I'm not even seeing lights turn on.,I use it on windows 7 and it auto detect (no additional software). The light should be on once you plug it into the usb.
Does this work with Windows 8?,"Yes it does work with widows 8. It works very well.Its a sound card . It's designed to plug into you pc's usb jack, and then you plug you headphones into it. I run mine through my amplifier. I use a 3.5mm audio cable plunged into (the headphone jack) and then I switch the amp to auxiliary and the sound from the speakers is quite remarkable."
"Hi, the sound does not work in my computer. every time i want to play something, it says that there is a problem in my sound card.Will it work for it?",Yes it will.
does it come with mounting bracket,Yes it did. However to mount it where i wanted it to be clean under my dash i had to fabricate my own.
is it use for taxi ? i have 4 taxis so how can i connect it together ? do they have antenna with or i have to buy them ?,"Hello you can use it for a taxi or any other vehicle. However, if you are using this for the taxi on multiple cars you would only need to sync and on the same channel system. Note there is not a sync for a repeater, so if you need the use of repeater you will need to look for that type of system ."
"i want to buy this radio to put on-line for my taxi ,but what can i need more for complete it ? antenna ,cable and what else ? help me please","You're gonna need antenna, cable and the antenna mount."
what kind batterys do i use,You need to connect it to you car battery or put a cigarette plug on the out put wires.
"Does this work well with a Dell Inspiron N5050? It's one of the models listed, but I'm wondering how well it works for long-term.","I don't have a N5050, but it is working fine with my Dell Laptop."
will this battery work with a dell n7010?,Perfect fit.
Does this work for the Dell Inspiron 17r N7110?,"I searched and it should, but you're OFF YOUR ROCKER if you buy this. I own it. It worked fine for about 4 months, degraded over the next 4 months, and now it won't make it 20-minutes on battery. I can't say this anymore bluntly, you're a glutton for punishment if you buy this battery after reading this answer."
Does this work with Dell Inspiron 3520?,Yes it does
"Does this fit a Dell N5030? Previously purchased one that claimed to, but we were unable to open the laptop when installed due to bump in back","this work for My Dell Inspiron 17r N7110, I don't know the N5030 is fit or not."
I bought this as a replacement battery for my Dell Inspiron N7110. It will only charge up to 90% and not any higher. Everything says that it is working normally. Has anybody experienced this same problem of not being able to fully charge the battery to...,I bought mine for an inspiron n5030. Charges to100% perfectly and gives me almost 6 hours run time!! Great battery. Not sure why yours didn't charge all the way up. But i would maybe have them send you another one maybe just a bad one?
what kknd of warranty comes with this battery?,None. And it didn't fit my laptop at all (too big by a millimeter)
What kind of warranty do you have,Meaning? Manufacture Warranty?
"my dell only lists inspiron 17, non numbers -what battery fits","right click on my computer, click properties, and you will see your model number under ""model"""
"Anyone try it in Dell N5010?Thanks,Chas",Working well in mine - factory battery was down to about 1 hour run time - this gives me 6+ hours now
"I too have the same question, do all these accessories come along with standard Box things (Battery,Charger, USB cable) OR it is only Camera + these","The base camera package is the camera, charger, battery, a level 4 or 6 memory card, and a computer cable. This supplier does include at the advertised package price all the stuff you see in the picture. I think it comes to about $20 more than the base camera alotment. Do you need all the extra stuff? Probably not, but it's lots of little things you may appreciate. If you want all the extras it's just $20. But I do suggest that you get from amazon two really good level 10 memory cards. Most retail stores only carry the level 4 cards, which cause delays in the shooting time and processing. I've only been able to get the level 10 cards on the internet, and they are worth the $10-$20 (depending on storage size you desire)."
can it take pictures right after another?,"Thanks to this question, I just learned something about the camera. When I used the camera recently, I noticed I had to wait about five seconds between shots. I just discovered a button on the back that looks like a target. After taking a picture, I can press that button and shoot again immediately."
"Can you turn the camera's sounds off without disabling the flash? If so, how?","Yes, turn on the camera, press the Menu button. You will see a wrench and hammer icon on the right tab. Press the right button on the control wheel to that icon. There will appear a bunch of options. The first is Mute, the second is volume. Cursor down to the volume, then press the OK button( the one is the middle of the control wheel). This will open up the volume for the various sounds. Just select each one, and press the left button on the control wheel, this will lower the volume on the item selected. Do this to all the sound options. Press the menu button to exit, and you will not have a silent camera that will take flash pictures. I did this on my camera, and had no problems with taking a flash picture. Good Luck David Devlin"
Does this highly recommended lil' camera have a digital viewfinder? Thanx!,No it does not---but still a great purchase!!
"Does the bundle include an extra battery, or is it just the one that comes with the camera?",My package included an extra battery.
battery type,Li-ion rechargeable with it's own charger. Bought a spare back-up to have just in case. A nice camera.
does this camera have a viewfinder?,"If the screen on the back that shows what the picture will be qualifies as a viewfinder, then, yes. By the way, my wife and I are very happy with this camera."
Is this camera wi fi capable,"Yes it does, although i have never used it. Here is the description ""The camera makes it easy to show off your high quality images and video wherever you are, with enhanced built-in Wi-Fi technology that lets you share photos with comments on social networking sites - even within specific groups. """
"Bundle includes.... Does this bundle include the original lithium ion battery AND a spare battery, or is it just one battery total?",I second that question - please clarify.
"Is this a good choice for 16 year old who is taking photography class and enjoying it? Right now he is using a ""vintage""Nikon no digital of course.","Yes! I think this will be ""easy to use"" while still giving any teen-ager interested enough in photography to take a course in it to have numerous options ""at the next level."" Affordable and I find especially fun to use to get close ups of various shots outside. Good luck."
Does it still have a problem with rapid battery discharge when shooting video?,Yes and it's also having rapid battery discharge while just shooting photos compared to the previous Canons I've owned. Disappointed how quickly the battery must be changed.
"will my NB5L batteries &amp; charger work with SX260? &amp; does ""ALL"" include a battery charger?",Nope. Need the NB-6L for this camera and the kit will usually include 1 along with a travel charger. Recommend the accessory kit offered separately. You will receive more items than you will likely need but having backups for my stuff is my mantra.
Is the Canon battery properity or can it use off the shelf batteries?,Not proprietary. I just bought this package and included in it is an aftermarket battery.
Does this camera come with any type of wrist strap or can one be attached?,It has a wristlet strap that attaches to the side. This portable camera isn't really big enough of suitable for a shoulder strap. I will tell you this though....I LOVE this camera. The photos are AMAZING and it's super easy to use. I highly recommend it.
Is the flash automatic? Does it flash when needed in point and shoot mode? Thanks!,"Yes, the flash is automatic. Overall this is an amazing camera, taking gorgeous pictures and crystal clear video."
"This bundle includes an extra batter, totaling 2 batteries and one charger for this product?","That is true, however the extras in the bundle are mostly junk and I never could get the second battery to charge. I would buy the camera then go to radio shack (or look at amazon) for just a second battery. You don't need 2 chargers! Camera comes with one charger."
"what exactly is the ""more"" in the ""... and more"" in the package description?","I don't know either, but if they expect to sell these the information should be there."
How were batteries packed? Inside the camera or separately? Are the 2 patteries or 1?,"Yes, I got two batteries... One of the batteries was packaged inside the actual camera box with the actual camera itself (not inside the camera) it was sepratley wrapped in plastic, and the other was packaged and shipped inside the larger box (the camera box itself was inside the larger box) along with the other items I recieved when I purchased my bundle.. Hope this is helpful!!!"
"Does the bundle still come with the tripod? The pictures show it, but the description does not.",Yes
Has anyone had any trouble using DVD+R Dual Layer with this or the program DVD Fab 9?,Works very well with DVD Fab 9.
is this drive 12.7mm ? doesnt really say,"I have no idea, but it fit in my Asus G73JW just fine."
"when it says ""M-Disc Support"" does that mean it will write to a M-Disc or just read them?","I believe it is read only. M-Disc writers are more expensive I think. The M-Disk website has a list of supported drives and the Bt-20N is not listed. Also, if you look on LG's website at some of the drives which are supposedly ""M-Disk Ready"", they list write and read speeds for the M-Disc format. The LG webpage for the BT-20N does not list any write or read speeds for the M-Disc. But I could be wrong. However I wouldn't want to gamble on it. Maybe try one of these drives on the list: http://www.mdisc.com/m-ready/"
Is there any difference between BT20N and BT30N? I can't find any difference in the specs.,"I could only find that the BT20N is 3 grams heavier than the BT30N. Otherwise, looking at LG's website, they seem to be identical spec wise. The BT20N has been performing great for me; I have already burned several BD-25 & BD-50 discs and it's fast enough."
Is this compatible with windows 8?,Beyond a doubt. Windows 8 installed the driver immediately. This is a great drive. You'll love it.
Can anyone tell me if this will fit a 17 Inch Laptop. I have an Acer Aspire 7740G-6816.,"It works fine in my 17 inch hp dv7-7012nr. It's not really the size of the laptop that matters. Almost all laptop optical drives are the same. If your's has an optical drive bay, this will fit. Also save yourself time, if you buy this get a paper clip so you can pop your bezel off the old drive and put it on this one. Had this drive for a while now, it's fantastic. You'll like it."
Can I use it for Msi gt683dxr? Do I need to do some modification?,"I don't know precisely for your Msi, but this is a standard drive, compatible with most laptops. Personally, I just installed it on my computer, a HP, and it was recognized right away."
Does this have a bezel?,"It come exactly like it looks in the picture. It has a staderd thin flat bezel held on by clips, that can be swaped with your existing one."
Will this fit to my asus k52f laptop?,Follow the link below: http://www.insidemylaptop.com/taking-apart-asus-k52f-laptop/
how much does it weigh?,"I just weighed mine, and it weighs 3lbs 8.8oz its a bit heavy but not too bad!"
What is the difference between the B300 and the B103?,The ball head is very smooth. A standard head difference is very noticeable when filming. You don't get the little jerking movements with the ball head or the noise(cracking or clicking) like when trying to film something using a standard head.
What is the maximum weight load for this tripod?,Not sure. It's pretty sturdy. I have a Nikon d7000 with a 55-300mm zoom lense on it and there are no problems
"Which is better, Aluminum or Carbon Fiber and why?",Most would say carbon fiber because it is very strong and much lighter than aluminum. If you hike difficult terrain or long distances you will want the lighter weight.
Is the ball head removeable? I prefer heads without quick release plates.,"Yes it is, no problem I use it with a MagicBall"
"What is the closed length, without ball head?","It fits into my carry on rolling luggage with the center post removed and layed along side it, which is exactly why I bought it and am loving it. I am going to say 19-20"""
"I need to know if I can mount a Gitzo ball head on this tripod. Also, can anyone provide detailed instructions for removing the Dolica ball head?","This model already has a Gitzo style ball head. If you want to add another type, here is a video on how to remove the ball head."
which country is it made in?,No information is printed/labeled on my tripod
"How much weight can the head hold. I shoot primarily a Canon 7D, with battery grip and a 70-200 L series lens.",7D+70-200 L will be fine..
Can this be coverted to be used as monopod ??,Perhaps by extending only 1 leg but the other legs are not detachable. I think it would be a little awkward to be used in that manner.
What's the best way to stream regular television from this device? Will it work with DirecTV? Does this have a digital tuner built in?,"First off, yes you can connect your Directtv. It has an HDMI input, s-video, component, and Usb inputs. Anything that outputs with those methods will work. It DOES NOT have a built in tuner. So you would simply run an HDMI cable from your Directtv unit. That's it. It does not have audio, so you would still need to have your audio from the Directtv running to a sound bar or other audio source, which you may already have. Hopefully this helps."
I am looking for a movie projector that I can use for outdoor/backyard movie nights. Is this a reasonable projector for this purpose? Thanks.,"Yes! It defintley is a great projector! It very bright and great for movie nights! The picutre quality is amazing even if it is at 720! I loved it for the month that i had it and because i loved epson brand i ugraded quickly to the 3D epson projector and as antisipated, an amazing product!"
"I suppose this projector replaces the 705 HD model, right? Any differences?",The only difference is the brightness the 710 is 2800 ANSI and the 705 is 2500
"With no audio output, how do you get sound from HDMI sources (cable boxes, Xbox, etc.) to external speakers?","I actually use an hdmi to component splitter in my setups with this projector, so that hasn't been an issue for me. Could also split off the HDMI to a stereo that accepts it if you have an hdmi splitter."
What do i need to connect external speakers for use with hdmi video signal,"Not sure what your set-up is but we use a dedicated HTPC as audio/video/BluRay source fed through a video card with HDMI-out interface. HDMI cable from PC feeds into an Onkyo Home Theater A-V receiver which processes the audio and video signals from the PC. HDMI-out from A-V receiver feeds video (only) to a projector for viewing movies, internet, photos on a big screen, etc. Receiver plays full 7.2 surround-sound audio for both music and video. Hooked up a separate computer monitor on the DVI-D-out interface coming from the same PC video card to avoid having to turn on the projector for everything. This versatile system offers the best of all worlds for viewing and listening enjoyment as well as internet surfing and general computer use. Everything plays in the highest quality and is right there at our fingertips with a few clicks of the mouse button. We use a dedicated HTPC but the same set-up could be easily achieved with a laptop if it has an HDMI-out. Hope this is helpful."
"Question, I wonder why the lamp went bad after only 1,888.00 of use is this the norm?","I'm not sure. The lamp is rated 4000 hours, 5000 hours in Eco-Mode. Maybe your not opperating in Eco-Mode?"
"Hi,I have a canon 24-70 lens. Will this work at 24? Or do you think I will ses!e black spots as others mentioned. thxn","I also have a 24-70 lens, I don't see black spots. However, this is a thick filter. When at 24mm, this is a wide view and in some lighting you may see the rim of the filter. That true with most filters anyway. I hope this has helped you. ----- RW"
Is this filter made of glass or plastic material ?,As far as I can tell it's glass. 2 layers that like your polarizer turns and gets darker as the 2 layer interact. Haven't really tried it yet so I can't comment on how well it works. But it goes from a light gray to so dark you can't see though it.
Has anyone noticed color shifting due to the tint of the glass?,I do a lot of time exposure waterfall pictures and I would be lost without it. In some cases as with all variables there is central and uneven darkening. Use numbered ND filters to over come this. http://fineartamerica.com/profiles/gene-rooney.html?tab=artworkgalleries
Does anyone use this with a 16-35?,Don't waste your money on this . I has terrible banding when stopped down at all
"How loudly does it type compared to most laptops? Is it what most people would consider a ""quiet typing keyboard""?","I have this keyboard, no I would not consider it a ""quiet"" keyboard. You can hear the keystrokes pretty well. It is not overly loud, but you can definetly hear it. My computer room is adjcent to my living room and no one can hear me typing in there, but standing in the doorway they can hear the typing, if that gives you any indication on the sound level. I hope I helped!"
Can the light be turned off so you don't have to use the lights during the day to save wear n tear?,Yes the light can be turned off. You press the light button and it comes on to the brightest level. Then you press it again and it goes to medium brightness. Then you press it again and it goes to lowest brightness. You press it again and the lights go out. I got this for my wife and she loves it.
"does this keyboard have volume control and mute buttons, if it does does it display a volume bar on the moniter?",has neither of those
Is there a media key-the kb had no instructional book or online address,"No, this is pretty much a no-frills keyboard except for the illumination feature."
Will this keyboard boot up with number lock on? Using windows 8.,"Yes, my number lock is always on and it boots up fine."
will this work with a mac??? is there a comand button like the mac keyboards?,"To use this keyboard on your Mac Open ""System Preferences"" . Cleck on the keyboard icon. When menu appears, n the lower left corner click on ""Change Keyboard Type"" then follow instructions. This keyboard works fine with a Mac."
Is there a light indicator for Caps Lock on?,"Yes, there's a green light that indicates this."
How long is the USB cord that connects the keyboard to the computer?,standard 6 foot
will it work with MAC?,"I brought it as a present for a Windows PC -- but if you go to the manufacturers web site at: www.impeccausa.com you can get a contact phone number and call them --- they are located in Wilkes Barre, PA (Note: I called them with a question and they were very helpful!"
can I use it on a laptop,If you have an open USB port you can use it on a laptop.
how do younset it up?,"I returned due to loss of signal issues. I ended up going with a Linksys extender,no problems and it does not re-label your router connection."
I have an RV and travel to locations with open wifi. Signals are weak in some locations. Looking to boost signals of any available network.,Good for this use.
how do i install netgear wn300rp,"Sorry but I haven't managed to make it work myself. I was just told that my ATT gateway needs to be set up so that it recognizes the IP number of the Netgear device; otherwise, it won't let it into the network. Good luck! Did you try to find instructions online?"
is it a fact that serial numbers are blacked out and there is no support for refurbished units ?,"Yes the serial number is blacked out but there shrill is support for this unit on the NetGear website like firmware updates I updated mine to the latest firmware though the NetGear website. I registered mine through NetGear and it has a selection for ""no serial number-refurbished unit"". I purchased an extended warranty with this so I am still covered for 3 years for $6 rather than just the 30 days."
I am renting a condo and have been given the wifi code to a hotel across the street. (100yd) The signal gets shoddy will this extender work for me?,"It depends on what you mean when you say the ""signal gets shoddy."" I was unable to connect except on one spot on my fourth floor (with the main connection on the second floor). There was only one spot where I could get almost-consistent signal quality on the fourth floor until I got the Netgear WN3000RP, which I placed in that ""sweet spot."" I still have the rare dropout and I mean rare. My advice? Unless your signal is just completely lousy, try it. You can always return it."
"I can not do connection my Netgear Universal WN3000RP Wi-Fi Range Extender i do not know, could you help me reconnect that","From your question I can not tell what exactly your problem is. You can go to netgear.com and type the model in a drop down menu. It will take you to a step by step manual. Remember, it gives you a link that is NOT a url. The link connects you to your new extender. After you have established that connection, you get a page with some questions after which you can finish the installation by simply clicking ""finish"". If it asks you to set a password, use the same that you use for your router. If you don't get through, let me know, and tell me what you did. I hope you get it this time."
I want to use for my Samsung smart TV for Net flex or youtube because I keep loosing internet my router in the second floor we living in a townhouse the smart TV I sin first floor in living room. I want something work please,"I have a Samsung smart tv and a Netgear router, which is in another room. I had a problem with Netflix dropping off line, so I bought this extender and placed it near the tv. It works perfectly. You do have to occasionally reboot the extender -- just unplug and replug it in."
"does this come with istall disk ,as i dont have acess to the modem?","No install disk, but you don't need to touch the modem. There are instructions included, so as long as you can get on the wifi you're trying to extend, you'll be able to set it up."
does this work with linksys?,My extender is linked with Netgear router. I do have a linksys router in another location that I use with a linksys extender and that is very good as well. I made the choice to match router and extender to the same brand and I am pleased with the results.
would this item work to extemd the range of an Apple Airport?,yes it works grate with all PC. I love it I get x2 range with this unit
"What is the model number of this item? I don't see the difference between it and the cl60126 for 38.99, other than color?",CL60127
Will this jacket fit the iPad 2,I have an iPad 2 and an iPad 3. I'm currently using this case on my iPad 2 and am very pleased with both the fit and the case overall.
Is this jacket made for the new mini?,No it's not. Sorry
Will this case fit my iPad air,I don't think so. It fits my iPad 3 which is bigger.
Can this be used for a generation 4 I Pad?,It fits perfectly for the 4th generation IPAD.
Will this fit the ipad 4th generation?,yes....
Does this work for iPad Air?,"Sorry, but cannot answer that. Mine is 3rd gen. Dick"
will this case fit my i Pad 2 for sure?,"Yes. I have it for a 3rd generation, which is practically identical to the iPad 2."
Does this case handle both the landscape and portrait positions?,Yes it does. But it doesn't really have a way to stand it on a table in the portrait position. I mainly use the landscape and the case does have things where you can set it in different positions and place on a table. Does that make sense? I really like the case.
Does this one fit the new iPad air just released?,I think it would be pretty loose since it was made for the iPad2 which is thicker.
Does this model fit and work with IPAD 4?,"Yes. It will be just a little tighter fit, but it will work just fine."
"The corners seem to be exposed. Does this damage the iPad over time at all, or when dropped, does it provide enough protection from the impact of the fall?",It seems protective enough to me. The edges don't stick out but if you were to have just the right drop you could potentially damage the ipad. Over all I find this to be very secure.
"is this for ipad 2, retina display? I just returned one that said it was, but camera hole was in center",The camera hole is in the correct spot on this case making it simple to take photos with the case on. I use this with the iPad 2.
Will this fit the iPad Air 2?,"NO, it will not, but I absolutely LOVE this case for iPad 4"
Does anyone know if there is any major difference between this one and the CL60131 for $11 less?,"im not sure, but this one is extremely durable. i have had mine for almost a year and i use it everyday and it still looks brand new!"
Does anybody out there knows whether the incase design for iPads works with the iPad Air? Please help because I am about to purchase one.,I don't know because I bought it for an older ipad.
Does this model in particular have A/V ports?,Yes it does.
I want to know 2 things. can this screen be used as a monmitor for my computor@ what is the actuac voltage used. Can I hook it up to 12 volts?,yes to the computer question......don't know about the 12 volts maybe with a inverter.
Will the DVD play mini disks from my camcorder?,No I don't think so. The DVD player is self loading so it is built to handle regular sized disks.I think if it pulled one to small inside it would become stuck.
How much are the connectors in the back recessed from the side of the unit? (distance). Will a flash drive not stick out past the width?,"The connections are recessed about 3 inches from the edge of the tv, so most thumb drives wont stick out past the width. Hopefully this helps you out."
Does the DVD start playing automatically when you load the disc?,It did the first time. I havent tried it again since the last time when it didnt work. I just hooked up my old dvd player to it. The tv itself is still working great...
How does it connect to a pc? Says there is a connection on back but no VGA input,"It DOES have a VGA connector........Look at the picture of the back and zoom in on it..........You will see it....Also go to the RCA website and download the manual which also shows the VGA connector as well as the ""hook up for a PC"" which also clearly shows the VGA connector. Someone didn't do a good job with the description here."
What is the viewing angle like?,"Absolutely perfect. I have one in each kids room and you can see PERFECTLY (never gets dark) from floor, standing, any corner of the room. Speakers are great, image great. A perfect buy, honestly!"
does this have a headphone jack?,"Yes, it has a headphone jack"
how do you connect external speakers? Do any settings on the tv have to be changed?,"I assume that when you plug in some headphones into that analog/headphone jack, the TV's speakers go mute automatically; so when you plug in a pair of special RCA cables that have RCA on one end of which you plug into your AMP and that mini pin on the other end of which you would plug into the TV's headphone jack, the same thing will happen, i.e. muted TV speakers. But instead of having headphones, you will have amplified speakers. Then you could set your AMP's volume level to something rather high, and control the volume of the TV through the TV itself using its remote."
How good is the ms for gaming?,"We do use it for COD on the PS3 and it's ok as a secondary TV. For about the 1st 20 to 30 min after we turn it on, it does have a dark line directly down the middle of the screen and the volume has to be turned almost to the max. If this is going to be your primary TV, I would keep shopping around!!"
does this tv can play video from an USB?,"I don't think so Christian. I think it can only display photos and play music via the USB port -- not videos. Also, I can't get it to display my photo's anyhow, so I can't even judge if that feature is good or not."
Can you mount to the wall?,si se puede montar en la pared
does this tv support miracast,No. BUT. You can buy a Chromecast or a ROKU stick for on the cheap and plug it into the hdmi port and turn this tv into a streaming tv. Miracast should then work.
Does this tv have bluetooth capabilities?,No
"I have an out door antenna, will this tv work withour cable or directv/",Yes as long as you have the correct connecting cables and a DTV or Cable box.
Did it come with a TV table stand? or do i have to buy that seperatly,Mine came with a stand.
For HDMI input (apple TV) the analog audio out option isn't available. Manual says analog audio out only avail in TV mode. Any work arounds?,"That's a strange question, hdmi connector is one big head. But for analog, have you tried the head phone jack up top for audio out?"
Does it have a headphone jack?,"Yes, it does right next to the USB port"
I have this tv &amp; it won't come on when i power it on. The light comes on like its on but no picture pops up. I have to unplug it several times before,"I Had the same problem. I took it back. it was 1 day after my 30day warranty. they wanted to give me another one of the same, I said why would I go through this again. up graded to LCG. will never buy RCA again there where good in the day but not anymore"
Where can i buy replacement screws for stand?,"Only thing I can suggest is to take one of the originals to a hardware store, and see if they can match it?"
How do you hook up a DVD player to tv?,"You would need a RCA cable, the cord that comes with the dvd player,(red,white,yellow)"
"my tv won't on if have to unplug it several times before it come on, why?",I have not experienced this problem with my TV. My TV is plugged in all the time and comes on/off each time I press the power button.
Does this TV have a sleep timer on it?,"yes, 120 minutes"
"I just got this TV and the picture quality is so bad (has shadows and images are blued), kindly share your setting,if you got a goood picture quality",My Picture setting is STANDARD... Screen Size is 100%...Aspect is set to NORMAL. Try these setting and let me know the results please...
does it have built in speakers?,"Yes it does. There are 2 speakers, one on either side of the stand. They point down, which could contribute to the poor found quality. I would like to update my original response too. I have since gotten into the sound settings. The tv offers preset options labeled dynamic, user, soft, etc. You can go deeper into those settings, however and adjust the bass, treble, and balance. Once I boosted the bass to 15 and brought the treble down low, it is so much better. I actually am enjoying it now."
how do you get the lines and creases out of the screen,"Screen has to be fully stretched on all four sides, pulled tightly and secured to the frame. After having done those three things and with the screen being outdoor, the daylight heat should help eliminate the creases. Keep this in mind, heat expands and cold contracts. It is best to tighten the screen against the frame during the hottest time of the day, because when the temperature get cooler/colder, the screen will contract, thus further stretching out the screen and eliminating creases. If you tighten screen against the frame at cooler temperature, when the screen get warm, it will expand thus causing creases and loose ends."
How difficult is the setup of this screen? And how big is the carrying case once it's broken down? Thanks.,Not difficult at all. Carrying case can be held in one hand.
Would this item work for indoor use? I would be interested in using this for presentations or short video clips.,I love this screen. Yes I feel great for everything. I would get the 120.
Is it possible to adjust the height of the screen as it mounts to the frame? I'd like to be able to fit it into rooms with lower ceilings...,SORRY.... NO IT DOESN'T
Does the screen allow light bleed through from behind? Or does it have backing to prevent this. I only want to use it for front projection.,"Hi Kate, I just purchased one and I would say yes. It is like a sleeve or sock that slide over the frame and fastens under the bottom tube of the frame. The back part is black stretchy nylon and would block most if not all light from the back. Of course you most likely would be using it in too bright of light."
Where is this made?,They are manufactured in China.
"It this frame copmatable with the WraithVeil 123"" (DIY123RH) screen as well?","It is not directly compatible, no. You probably could find a way to attach it - but it would be your own DIY project. I would suggest checking the dimensions of both products before you make any purchases."
"Is this a rear projection screen? If not , is there a model that is rear projection or front/rear projection?","No this is a front projection screen, the back is blacked out to prevent light from coming through."
"Is this a rear projection screen? If not , is there a model that is rear projection or front/rear projection?","This is not a rear projection screen. There are other model/series that's a rear projection screen, like the DIY Series from Elite Screens available through Amazon as well."
which auxiliary speakers fit?,"This tv has a 3.5 input for the speakers which is very common. We feel the built in speaker is fine, but sometimes we'll plug in the speakers that we use on the i-phone. Hope that helps."
How or where do you connect a pair of computer speakers? All I see is a digital audio out port on the side. Update: I initially tried a set of cheap unpowered pc speakers. They didn't work. Bought a $10 set of Logitech powered speakers from...,Try the headphone output. This is working fine for me.
What is the total measurement of the TV from the top to the table with the stand in place?,13.1 Inches. Hope this helps.
Does this tv have an auto on / off function sometimes called an alarm?,Doesn't ...

"In the product description it states: Swivel Stand For tabletop mounting, a swivel stand is included. Not true, the mounting stand is fixed. Right?",Only a fixed stand on mine.
Is this tv compatible with rabbit ears or the converter box???,Yes it has a coaxial connection
Can this be connected to a standard wall cable?,Yes if coaxial is what u mean.

what are the measurements without the stand,22.5 x 14.25 inches
"How many HDMI ports does it Have ? Some website specs say 3, some say 1 . Which is it ?",Most depends on who you order from mine came with 3 ports but trust me get another brand of tvs.

You have to buy your own wall mount, and they all come with a series of screws for any size TV that will fit the mount. I went with a Cheetah mount from Amazon that was rated for 32 inch TVs, and it came with all the screws.

How long the battery last per charge??,"2 hours, then charge it again, the first two times let it charge for 12 hours, after that 1-2 hours.."
what is the lux rating?,The camera never worked from day one. I have followed the instructions to the letter. I had my friend Jason from Super Computer work with it. The company buys defective ones dirt cheap and resells them is what their customer service told me. So thats that.
if i plug the charger in will it charge and record at the same time while im gone for two weeks?,Yea it will.
which device I need to connect to the camera to record videos?,You don't need to connect anything to the camera just press the button twice to record or you can Google it to be sure about it
would it be good for a locker,Possibly but haven't figured out how to set motion activation. Used it to see potential theft in locker as well but only runs for about 2 hrs or less unless larger capacity chip is uses
"One customer said it does not record images at all, yet the description said it does. Does it record images when motion is detected, and for how long","It records one video, as long as there is motion to record. Once it stops, it does not restart, so is not actually motion activated, which would continue to start and stop, each time there was motion to record."
does it contine to record for 30 min after motion detecor is set off even with no acitivty? Or does it record for a certain incriment times?,Does not record at all.
does this come with sd card or do i need to get one,Need to get one
How many hours are video recording automatically?,what type of battery does this use. Might be able to hard wire it to a transformer.
"We just received our crystal magic ball today, and it does not react to sound or music. What should we do?",Go to 52 or S2 and it will go with the music. we love our magic ball! best thing i ever bought!
"When plugged in and turned ""off"" the fan continues to run: Is there a real power-off switch or does it have to be unplugged with each use?",It has to be unplugged
How do you get the DMX to work,"If it doesn't work pretty much automatically when you plug it in, you might consider returning it for one that works. Mine worked fine righf out of the box"
does the light that comes with remote and the one without remote gives the same light effect?,Yes- the light effect is very similar. I love them both.
Is the rotation just back and forth or should it rotation in one direction too?,The lights rotate back and forth
colors,RGB - Red Green Blue
"When I plug in, it just blinks. The LED display does not light up and gives no option for entering anything. Does this sound like it a bad one?","For some reason the connections shake loose in shipping inside the light. You could try making sure they're all connected properly. UNPLUG the light, remove the 4 screws and just wiggle all the connectors to make sure they're tight. Replace the cover and try it again. I did this on the 2nd one (same problem) and it fixed it! Good Luck!!!"
"Can someone post the User Manual online somewhere (e.g. Scribd)? Mine came without the manual, and I'd love to see it.",There is no user manual just some sheet of paper with DMX channels in english and chinese. I have tried getting a hold of mfr and the supplier selling this for information on how to operate this product with no luck. I was also not very happy that the original crystal ball I ordered was not only late arriving but appeared to have been an opened box item that was sent to. Me when Amazon replaced the light the sent me another unit that had a defect and took nearly 2 weeks to ship despite it being flagged for overnight service the supplier of this light and Amazon clearly dont care about quality or service. That being said it is a great light assuming you get one that works and can figure it out. I would really like to be able to use the 2 I have in Master Slave Mode as the box and product description clearly state it being capable of doing yet I have been unable to figure it out.
"What does the ""DENTER"" button do? I assumed it was a misspelling of the word ""ENTER"" but thought I might check to see if anyone knows. Thanks!",Yes it is enter. By pressing it after you choose a pattern of lighting displays.
"does this product creates exactly same light effects as shown in the pictures of this product, i am thinking of getting one which sells for 17 dollar.",Yes it does. It has different patterns. The one I like is when it's voice activated. The darker the room the more lightened effect it has.
Is that an adjustable height lens support at the front of it?,Indeed it is. You can also wedge it under the baseplate on the cantilevered side with a heavier camera.This thing can get a little springy with a big rig or large broadcast-style camera.
Does it have a quick release plate? Thanks.,No
does this come with the rods and the front support or is it just the plate with the lift.,Comes with everything including rods and front support.
Is this product compatible with the Canon XH-A1 camcorder?,"Well, it's compatible with about anything with a tripod screw. I've used it on a Panasonic AC 130/150 and it's not optimal for a camera that big but did OK, not super stable with a long lens (you'll see some shake) but OK for shoulder mount. You can slide the lens support under the camera platform for more support/stability."
Are those rods threaded to add additional length if necessary,"Yes. However not all couples will work. I got some that were painted and while they were the right TPI and diameter, the paint made them too snug to fit on these. I'd stick with Neewer/Fotga (if they sell them) or other anodized/untreated couplers."
How is the quick release plate? Does it work correctly?,Works great. In love it! No problems encountered.
will this rod system support a zoom lens up to 200mm? Does it have adjustable lens holder? Is this different from Fotga DP500 specs say it's lighter,"I use it with a 6D, 70-200 2.8, matte box, 7"" monitor, and Tascam recorder. No problem at all. The lens support is actually upside down in the photo. It has a piece that you can slide up and down as needed. These are actually very impressive for any price. The cam action screws are better than the high end Red Rock micro screws. Buy it, you won't regret it."
When will there be more in stock??,this item is in stock right now.
Is this webbing srong enough for replacement on Danish chair bottom?,Way more than strong enough. The problem I had was that they shorted me something like 8 inches so I couldn't use it for my application. Keep in mind that it will stretch when stressed. I used it to pull 250 lbs and at 25 feet it stretched several inches. For a couple of feet and with multiple strands stretching won't be an issue.
How does this webbing compare to seatbelt webbing? Is it soft like a seatbelt or is it stiffer in texture? Thanks.,"It is very soft and silky similar to a seatbelt, except it's thinner."
"I want this to wrap around a rear seat in a minivan to provide a place to hook dog, no weight, just security, but I don't want any buckle to mar upholstery. Recommendation?",Glue Velcro to the ends or any segment of the strap and viola no buckles. Just make sure it's decent quality velcro.
Would this strap be recommeded to hold 400 lbs on a hammock?,"Yes, its very strong"
Outdoor metal swing seating for 2. I am looking to replace with webbed straps and put cushions on top of webbing. Would this be strong enough?,Yes. Easily strong enough
would i be able to tie a slip knot at the ends,"I suppose, but keep in mind that it has a feel like a textured seat belt and is about the same thickness. When bent with the grain, it is very pliable. Bent longwise, against the grain, it does have a stiffness to it. Hope this helps."
"If your wife liked movies, would you feel the need to add a sub? How big is your room?","My wife would be just as happy with the built-in TV speakers, I'm the obsessed golden eared enthusiast. I tried the Vision with a Monitor Audio Radius subwoofer I had around...I was actually very pleased with the results....I thought the Vision sounded even better so I'm keeping the Radius in. For my needs, the Vision is still just for TV shows and sports...most movies we watch are on disc so I use my my 5.1 ML system, but if my home theater had to make do with only a soundbar, I'd want nothing less than the Vision. I love it. I hope this helped."
Does it have a voice enhancement mode. Important to me because I wear hearing aids.,"No voice enhancement mode but the ""night"" mode makes dialogue much clearer. I find myself using it all the time for that reason."
"Is this same model that bestbuy sells? I heard ML soundbar in store, but that one is very expensive compared to this price (can't post a link).","Yes, it is!"
Does it support 220~240 voltage?,Everything I've read about this product says it does not. I checked my unit and I see no voltage switch to accommodate 220/240.
Will a Dish Network Receiver connect to this unit?,"The unit has 2 optical inputs and 1 coax input for digital audio, and RCA inputs for analog audio. So you'll have a couple of options with your Dish receiver: either connect it directly to the unit with one of those audio cables (depending on the outputs the Dish receiver has), or use your TV's Digital Out to connect it to the unit (not that most TVs downsample their Digital Out so it's better to connect the receiver directly to the unit)."
Does it have bluetooth? Can you stream music?,No blue tooth
I notice this does not come with a subwoofer. Is the bass still deep? Do they sell a separate subwoofer if I decide to get this?,"Yes, the bass is already pretty deep. You can plug in any regular subwoofer into it too. Plus ML sells a wireless one too."
What are its dimensions? How wide and high high?,Product Dimensions: 5.8 x 39.9 x 5 inches ; 20.5 pounds
can this unit be used with a wired sub-woofer that is not ML?,Yes standard sub output outlet

Does it have bluetooth for listening on bluetooth headphones?,No
is there a volume control on remote,"WH I don, t think so due to the fact it has a manual volume control on the box on the remote its got an audio button you might try that . But l have not used the remote yet , good luck Dorothy"
Can I plug in my iphone?,Yes
At the denen ah d400 headphones wireless,"non, it needs line connect between headphones and PC/Phone...etc."
"I bought one set but got the audio cable lost, can I buy another audio cable or the bag set?","Yes they are available, contact denon customer service they are very helpful."
Any ideas on a harder carrying case that would fit for these?,They are really large and don't fold so an aftermarket case wouldn't work because of its unique shape. You are better off keeping the box they come in which is nice and looks like a book more then a typical box
"I just received my headphone. However, the microphone is NOT working. the volume is too low to hear. Is there something wrong with this headphone?",Some options only work with apple stuff. Make sure the volume is up on the player your using and the headphones. Make sure you only charge it with a laptop or computer. Make sure you have the switch on the headphones for the amplifier on
I am unable to use the headphones to control the music on my iPhone 4S. However it works completely fine on my macbook. am i missing a step?,Did you push in the cable all the way in?

How comfortable are these and do they completely fit over your ear?,"They are comfortable and they fit over my ears, I can only wear them for so long with my glasses though."
how good is the bass on these headphones compare to beat studio over the ear ?,Bass is good and tight. And with the price range you can't loose
would these work as a gaming headset since they have a built in microphone?,I believe they would work in the Ps4 because i can connect other headphones in and they work but unsure about xbox one. I think the older systems wouldn't work with this headset.
What is the frequency response?,"5-37,000 hz"
"Does anyone have an issue and fix with the bluetooth connectivity? Only the right side works, with wired connection both sides work, already reset it",Never had an issue with Bluetooth connection. Both L and R stereo reception works fine. I have mine paired with an iPhone 5s.
how does the sound compare to denon d600? anybody compared? tnx,"Sound is good and crisp as I travel worldwide and a good purchase however the Parrot that I recently purchased is noise canceling as well as Bluetooth and u can use for phone I have had many in and over hear head sets, Parrot is BEST and most comfortable by leaps and bounds Thx"
how long to recharge,"3 to 4 hours but the best thing is you can use it even when it is discharged. You will only be able to use it with wires , bluetooth won't work without charge."
Is there a noticeable audio delay when using these to watch video? Meaning does the dialog sound out of sync with video on-screen?,"yes, it's audio will delay, not a good idea for watching tv."
"How many devices is allowed with the travel app, redeem with this purchase?",Only one device headphones and additional cables.

Where are they manufactured or made?,Made in China..

Is it compatible with Android phones despite the multiple buttons? Does the mic work with Android?,"I use android (htc one) and the the functions are limited to where the volume doesn't change when the earbuds are used. Click for pause/play, answering/ending phonecalls as well as the mic works perfectly fine. I'm not missing the volume function too much so I'm happy with them, and I bought them in January. Hope this helps"
"When plug into PC, Dose the Control works?",No
are the cables replaceable?,"I do not think that these cables are replaceable, but I would check Denon's website."
Does the control wheel allow for voice commands for an iPhone?,"yes if u click once without any music app is on, it goes thru siri"
"How is the sub-bass rumble on these? When I go to college I want some basshead in-ears, so I can have Skullcandy Crusher-like bass on the go.",The bass in these headpones are incredible. I would say they are much better than the synthetic sounding bass in the skull crushers. It feels as if you have subwoofers attached to your ears. It is also important to have a snug fit in order to enjoy theses babies.
does it works with Samsung galaxy note 3,"I don't know mate. But the mic and pause/play/answer button work on my HTC Android phone. The volume ring, however, don't work with Android. They are exclusively designed for iOS devices. I hope this helps."

Will this fix a D7000 with Nikon 18-300mm VR lense?,18-300mm lens may be too long to fit into it.
How many mm thick would you say it is? The Caselogic PS-213 is 6 mm thick. I'm wondering if this case is comparable.,"I only have one other case to compare it to. It is an older Tucano Second Skin. Compared to the Second Skin, this is noticeable thinner. If you are in need of a thick sleeve, I would look elsewhere. If you want a good basic thin sleeve, this will be perfect."
Would the case fit a Macbook Pro 13 w/retina display with a case??,It fit my 13.3 MacBook Pro perfectly.
"Hello, I would like to know the weight of this sleeve, Thank you!",Very light weight
"Is this too big for a dell xps 13? I want the sleeve to be very fitted to the laptop, no extra room.","Hello, I'm sorry but I do not have an xps 13, this sleeve is perfect for my Asus u47a with these dimensions 12.9"" x 8.9"" x 1.2"". Hope it helps. Alessandro"
what are the exact dimensions in inches....,13 by10 but they r stretchy material
dell xps 13,It would work for that too since its a 13 inch laptop and since it is fit to ultrabook standard
lenovo,"I can only assume that you are asking me whether this case will fit a Lenovo laptop, which I'm not familiar with. My laptop is a 13"" Apple MacBook Air. It measures 12.75"" X 9.00"" X 0.50"". Fits like a glove, but it can handle slightly thicker laptops. I hope this helps."
Can this be used for my 13.3 inch Asus UX31A too?,"the company is veryyy easy to be contacted you could either go to their profile or call them and they answer any questions you have, I would hate to give you the wrong answer to your question. Hope this helps:)"
"Just for keeping next to my chair, does anyone think my 10"" iPad will fit in the outside pocket?","With the zipper open my iPad 2 does fit in the outside pocket, however 1/3rd of the iPad 2 sticks out, and of course then you cannot Zip the outside pocket"

"I have two lenses for this sony Nex 3 camera, one is a 40.5 mm diameter and the other is 49 mm. Will these filters work with both lenses?","The filters are for 49 mm, the close ups are for 52 mm and can fit 49 mm lens via adaptor which is included.

Are these filters really for the sony nex cameras or do you need to use an adapter? Are there any better alternatives if they use an adapter?,Any 49mm filter will fit any 49mm dia. lens. You may be thinking about using a different lens on a different camera like a Nikon lens on a Canon camera

"how many hours are on this battery, I just got one and it only has two hour before it needs to be charged again.","My battery also only lasts about 2 hours, before it needs to be charged."

There appears to be a 19 Pin Header but still it is not mentioned in Specs."
"If module removed, machine won't start of course. When module resocketed, will I need a recovery, or will it just work again? (long trip coming up)","Depends on the encryption being used. If bitlocker then yes as bit locker also detects changes in the bios settings and enabling or disabling tpm chip (via removal) counts. If the chip was removed and not attempted to boot hard drive, and then put back in, shoot work as long as bios settings are the same. But if an attempt is made, it won't matter if bios is the same or not, will prompt for recovery key. I would back up your recovery in advance, then you have nothing to worry about."

Hello! I have a card of the brand Foxconn H61MXV model and I wonder if this module is compatible with it? Thank you.,"Hello Fernando. Other people have successfully installed this TPM module on other manufacture motherboards. As long as that montherboard has a 20 pin TPM header on the motherboard, this should work. The main determining factor seems to be if the motherboard has a socket or just pins sticking up out of the board (like ASUS does). If the motherboard has a socket, you might have a bit of trouble plugging this TPM module in as the PCB board sits down low next to the plug and would prevent it from going into sockets. I found this guys article here very helpful to answer you question -&gt; https://sites.google.com/site/techbobbins/home/articles/gigabyte-motherboard-tpm-compatibility Hope this helps."
the camera comes with included lens?,"Yes, with the 18-55+ kit it comes complete with lens"
What is the zoom's capacity? Only 3x? Is it good enough?,Yes Ana C. It isn't listed as 3x zoom but that is pretty much what it is. It isn't equivalent to say field glasses but it does provide a suitable enlargement of the subject. I like it. There are also other bundles as well with a more powerful zoom lens or telephoto lens. Of course you can get pretty much the camera body and a lens of your choice.
Is this a new camera or refurbished? Is this camera eligible for extended warranties?,"Was a new camera. I didn't inquire about an extended warranty. Just got back from Long Beach WA and all the wind with blowing sand and the camera worked fine. Have enjoyed the ""Guide"" feature as well as the preset settings. I HIGHLY recommend the camera and its ease of use with quality pictures. Can ""blow up"" small images and they are fine because of the 24 mp of the camera."

Will this work with an original gba?,"Yeah absolutely it will. I use it in my original GBA, my Japanese GBA (I don't think they are region locked BTW), and my GBA Micro. I haven't tested it in a GBA SP but all indications are that it works fine in them as well (tons of people in the forums have confirmed this). Only issue to watch for is about 15-20 have problems with the slower SRAM in the SuperCard (Doom 1&2, Yoshie's island, Tony Hawk 3 etc.)The slowdown in those titles is noticeable though not necessarily game breaking. If those are some of the games you would like to play you may want to invest in the EZ Flash IV or the EZ Flash V Fat Version, both of those have full speed memory but finding them can be tricky."
"Is this the actual supercard for GBA(flash cartridge), or an adapter to plug into the SD Card into the supercard?","Yes its the flash cart, plus the mini sd adapter"
How do I add codes on to it and have it work? I have added the roms but none will load when I try. It just gives me the blank screen of death.,for the rom to work go here(http://eng.supercard.sc/soft_minisd.htm) download Software: SC MiniSD v2.71(2010.03.25) after you download and install then add the rom to the program and press out on the bottom and a new rom and other settings should appear. Drag those to the to the micro sd card and game should play but remember some roms are corrupted and may not work in that case find a new site to download the rom again and that should fix it. this flash kart works well but you have to do this extra step for it to work.
"When I try to start it up, the purple nintendo text beneath the gameboy logo is just broken text... help?",Okay yeah that's not supposed to happen did you try blowing on it? It really does help. What are you using to play it on? Maybe it's your system? Make sure you've plugged it in properly that's usually why gba cartridges do that.
does it work with rom hacks,I'm not certain. I would download the converter from their website. If the converter works I assume it'll play.
Do you ship to Peru?,Well technically yes. Amazon Fulfill Service handles the shipping and I enabled global shipping. But Amazon global shipping service will determine if they can ship to your country. Simply checkout and fill in the address in Peru and see if they are able to do that.
Can this support GB and GBC roms to or does it only support GBA?,It supports all 3 formats

is this a good replacment for an old gateway laptop with Windows Vista,"I really liked everything about this laptop; size, speed, looks... EXCEPT the touch pad. Prior to purchase I had read that some people had trouble with the touch pad but everything else looked good so I decided to take a chance. Unfortunately, very soon after purchase the touch pad started acting wonky and just got worse with time. IF you are someone that uses a mouse with a laptop and this is the screen size you are looking for, then YES, I would say it would be a good replacement. I prefer Windows 7 over Vista and again, the speed on this machine is great."
does it come with a ac wall charger,Yes it does. But think very seriously about buying any Acer product. Their after sales customer service is non-existent! Trying to get hold of anyone is virtually impossible and once you have bought one of their products they don't want anything to do with you. I still have my Acer S-3 (still only 18 months old) but I only use it as a backup. Since I bought the Acer I replaced it with an Asus product and I'm very happy with it.
does this laptop come with mircosoft office if so what year,"No, mine did not come with Microsoft Office."
does this laptop come with the ac charger?,Yes it does.
Is removing Acer's loaded bloatware help speed up the lap top? what are the bloatware to remove?,"There's always bloatware, you just have to remove it. Being a Linux user I just blow away everything and not worry about it. If you use Windows ""add/remove"" in control panel is your friend."
it has touchscreem?,No
Is the battery replaceable?,Yes. I replaced mine.
How do I put Office 2010 on it with no CD/DVD drive?,I used an external CD drive.
how long is my garanty for a refurbicshed ultrabook,"I think 1 year, same as new one.."
"what does it mean by ""LED Lit"" monitor?","Traditional big box monitors were lit using a Cathode Ray Tube (CRT), which was generally very hot due to the extremely high voltage required to power them. The next generation of monitors (What people typically refer to as ""Flat-Screen,"" but actually the difference was in the Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) vs. the glass projection screen from the CRTs) were much slimmer and took a lot less power to operate; these were lit by Compact Fluorescent (CFL) bulbs, typically found at the bottom but sometimes both bottom and top. To finally answer your question, ""LED lit"" monitors use Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) to light up the image you see on the LCD screen. So what you need to understand from an advertising perspective is, if the monitor is being sold as ""LCD"" then it is likely ""lit"" by CFL. If the monitor is being advertised as ""LED lit,"" then it is still an LCD but uses LEDs to light up the display. The benefit of ""LED lit"" is drastically reduced power consumption, as well as brighter back lighting and typically less bleed over on the edges so the blacks look darker."
"I want to turn a monitor into portrait on a VESA stand to view 1 full page of a Word document w/o scrolling. Do I need a 19"" or 20"" monitor? Thanks!","It depends on how big your toolbars are. To be sure I can view a document at 100% view with my 20"" monitor."
does it have a plugin for speakers,"Yes, there is a plugin for the built in speakers."
This monitor is compatible with windows 8?,yes I have windows 8
Does this monitor have a 100mm VESA mount?,"It doesn't include a mount itself but you can use one (not sure of the actual measurements, sorry)."
"Hello there,I would like to run two monitors off of my dell optiplex 745 vista 32 bit operating system so my question is will this moniitor work for","Don't know about the Dell - 2 monitors , but the DVD with the monitor says it's compatible to Vista 32 and 64 bit. The only peculiarity is full screen is slightly elongated. Can adjust to normal screen by the menu buttons. However, normal screen has 2inch black area each side doing this. I don't mind the elongation unless viewing photos taken by me. Adjustments don't seem to have much effect ,up down whatever. Did some and screen was too bright , a little glare. But went to factory default and the picture is perfect. Color, brightness etc. Leaving it at this setting. The monitor is perfect for the use I have for it with normal day to day use. Oh...this monitor has speakers but I have others that I use instead. Someday I switch just to hear these . A cable for speakers comes with it."
"Is there an HP 21"" monitor that comes without speakers Brian",this have speakers
what is the total width and total heigth?,"The screen is 10'' high and is 17 1/2"" wide."
Is it compatible with Compac Presario and Microsoft Vista?,Yes it is compatible with a Compac Presario and Microsoft Vista. You might be able to use more of its functions with Vista than with an older computer such as Presario
Does this monitor have built in speakers?,Yes
Will this be eligible for Windows 8 upgrade since buying through Amazon?,"it said something about upgrading it to win 8 for 15$ on acer's site. also, this isn't available on amazon and i dont think it will be for a long time so i am getting Acer Aspire V3-571G-6407 for similar to better performance and basically the same thing without in built mic."
Can I get this laptop with 750 gb instead of 500 gb,Yup but first you need a small screw driver. then u unscrew the back of ur computer. Once u unscrew that go to amazon and type in 750gb 7200rpm. Then once u get it take the 500gb 5400rpm off and install the 750 gb 7200rpm. easy installation. Right now my computer is coming. I'll be upgrading it to 8 gb of ram and I'll update my review later. I hope my computer is working :D
can this be mounted on a wall,Yes it can. I have it on a mount right now in front of me
Does this monitor have a VESA mount?,The back of the unit has four threaded holes for attaching a VESA mount. The holes become exposed when you remove the plate on the back of the monitor. The holes and their distances are compliant with the VESA standard for mounting flat-panel monitors. I used these to connect my monitor to the VESA mount provided by the standing desk that I use.
are speakers built in,"Nope. Nice screen but no speakers. Where the confusion may be coming from is the instruction sheet states that ""Select Models"" have speakers. It does not say which models do but I can confirm that the exact part number that I purchased which is listed as HP W2371d does not have speakers. TechDev1 answered on June 4, 2013"
Is this monitor mountable to a VESA mount?,Yes it is.
Will this connect to Mac mini?,"I own 3 of these, and I HIGHLY recommend it. Yes, this is compatible, but you need to buy an HDMI to VGA(or HDMI to DVI) http://www.amazon.com/Cable-Matters-Active-Female-Adapter/dp/B00879DM56/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1388371894&sr=8-2&keywords=hdmi+to+vga+adapter"
Would I be able to rotate the monitor by 90 degrees ?,"The stand and monitor are fixed and not on a swivel base so if you choose to change the direction of the screen, you have to move the stand also."
How steady is thw monitor on desk?,Very steady. I have had it on my desk for over a year and have knocked the desk. It doesn't rock or move when I bump the desk.
are there speakers in monitor,no speakers
Does it have a Matte screen?,Yes
overall size,"21.75"" x 13.5"" The stand lifts it 2.75"" above the desktop"
How do you search for a station by name / for example WMET ? Do you need a remote?,"Go through the menu and select ""stations"" until you get a keyboard image. Using the rotating side, click each letter of wmet into field and it will search for that specific station. However, if that station is unavailable, just email sangean and they will add it."
"What do the different lights on the Battery Charge Indicator, and what do they mean??","The battery indicator button has two(2) functions. 1.When using regular, non rechargeable, alkaline D batteries, and with the correct position of the switch inside the battery compartment, the light will turn ""red"" when your batteries are low and need to be replaced. 2. The radio has a great feature in that it has a built in NiMH charger. So buy some ""good"" quality rechargeable D batteries(i.e. Tenergy),insert them properly and move the switch over to the NIMH side inside the battery compartment. Plug in the included AC adapter. NOW the battery indicator button will blink ""green"" indicating that the internal NiMH batteries that you just installed are charging! When charging is done, takes a while, it will turn a solid green indicating full charge. When the Nimh batteries run low the light will turn red indicating you need to plug in the AC adapter and recharge the NiMH batteries. YOU NEVER HAVE TO BUY BATTERIES AGAIN! ENJOY!"
"How is the sound, especially the base?","As well as can be expected from a good size portable. Not hi-fi but good enough, and there is an equaliser in the software that you can personalise."
Is there a US warranty with this radio?,"Yes, box comes with card stating: Sangean Limited Warranty, Sangean America Inc. warrants this product to be free from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and conditions for a period of one year from the date of original purchase on parts and labor. It goes on to explain how to send it to Santa Fe Springs, CA for repair if needed. Basically mail to them with a check or money order for $8 for return postage."
You can listen to thousands of radio stations but you can only store 10 ?,"The Presets are for your favorites most used. You can 'store"" a much larger amount under the ""menu"" in categories you create like ""country"" or whatever you like, through the radio's web interface. Then retrieve them with the menu. Not ""one button"" but you can save many, many stations! I did a longer review under ""carlyle tech"" at www.i1430.com, look for the one dated March 10th. We're a streaming station and one that I had to put in manually and it worked GREAT."
"Does it have a low-res monochrome text-only display, or a high-res full color graphical display? Amazon's and Sangean's web sites differ.",Mine has a bright orange display against a dark backround
Distance to wifi,Seems to be pretty strong. Home Office and bedroom are both about 30 feet from wi-fi. Internet radio shows stronger signal than laptop.
Can you plug in a USB memory stick into this radio to listen to your own mp3 music files?,"Yes, according to the manual. I never used it but the manual says it supports MP3, WMA AAC, FLAC and WAV. It does not support files encoded using WMA lossless, WMA voice, WMA 10 Professional nor files of any format which have DRM protection. Nice radio..."
Somebody knows real dimensions of this device out of the box? Thanks.,overall roughly length 9.5 inches; height 5.5 inches by 2 inches wide
Is the WFR-28's display brightness adjustable?,yes
Can people hear you on this one? Can you hear them?,In normal use it is a good device. If you are driving in a convertible top down at 70 mph it probably won't meet your expectations.
what a bulk pack? I want in original pack sealed,"It's in a padded envelope, with only 1 ear bud, 1 ear hook. The one I purchased I feel that it were a use one it does not respond to my voice when I say answer or ignore."
Does it have a chager with it ..,Yes it comes with a charger and it charges quickly. A very good bluetoothe! Ihave purchased others but this is definitely my favorite. You will like!
Does it com with charger?,"Yes, it does come with a charger."
"If I buy two (one as a present), do I have to pay shipping twice?",sorry only one in stock
the cheaper Plantronics M155 i think its $13.00 are the ear buds changeable as the one for $28.00?,"I believe all the Plantronics M155s are the same and the ear buds do fit them all. The cheaper one comes in bulk packaging, meaning just a plain plastic bag, no original packaging. I have bought several in both original and bulk packaging (my husband keeps losing or drowning his) and they are all basically the same. The newer M165 has an extra 2 hours on the battery, but the rest of it is the same as the M155."
Can it Pair with a Radio. A motorolla radio to be exact. To be used for like employees who need to be able to have contact Via radio.,"I can't say for certain, but I know some Bluetooth ear pieces just pair with the phone for calls, where this does play adio from my phone (music, you tube, videos, etc) hope this helps"
"How to end the call ? is there a button to end call ? or should i just say ""END CALL"" ?",Same button u answer the calls with
I have bought 4 and keep loosing or washing them. Is it possible just to buy the ear unit alone...please?,Don't think that's possible since it's one piece. I suggest you buy two ...One for a spare for when you lose or wash one. Good luck.
Does the device come with ear hooks?,yes it does.
Is the battery included?,"Yes, Indeed it is !! It's rechargeable battery. It will tell you when the battery is low & when so, you plug it in till it's charged. You do not need to keep the plug plugged in all the time. I just love my Motorala Bluetooth in Car !!!"
I have one of these. I can't get my pandora to work on it thru my cell phone. Is it capable of that?,"Sorry but I don't have the answer to that. Try contacting Motorola, they will know."
will it work with nokia lumia 800?,"Honestly, I don't know. My guess is - yes it will. It is supposed to work with any phone that has bluetooth. If you want to know for sure, you'll probably have to contact Motorola."
will it work with iphone5s?,"Not sure, it worked wth the 4 but the device was not that great. If you have a big quite car with no road noise it may. I did not like it"
Does this transmit the call through the car's speakers?,"No, this device is a speaker that works with your phone. Reception is great, however at the other end everyone I speak with has difficulties hearing clearly, Holding the phone closer to my mouth (defeats the purpose of hands free really) works best. Pairing was easy and battery life is great otherwise. If you want something that works through your car speakers it will require professional installation from a place such as Car Toys. In short if I had known all this up front I wouldn't have thrown my money away on this particular device, you get what you pay for in this case."
"What does ""Bulk Packaging"" mean?",It is not a retail package...meaning it isn't in the normal plastic clamshell style container. It is a plain cardboard box not meant for retail displays like you'd find in a store. But it includes everything the retail packaged version would.
can this item being be used with blackberry tour,"Hi Aron That unit broke after about 2 weeks and the customer service / support was so ATROCIOUS / TERRIBLE/ NON EXISTENT that I would NEVER EVER buy another Motorola product as long as I live!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I returned the unit to Amazon and bouth the Jabra ""tour"" and LOVE that unit!!! It is FANTASTIC and they have great Tech support. You can go to the Jabra site and see what Jabra units are compatible with your Blackberry tour Z"
what is bulk packaging?,"Bulk packaging is normally a large number of the same item being purchased. Such as a case of the same item, which would give you a better purchase price."
did this come with a manual and charger?,It did come with a charger. I'm pretty sure it has a manual too. If not there's one online.
WORKS WITH IHPONE 4S?,Yes.
is this what i need to pair my bluetooth headset to my tv,"Yes you can use this for a bluetooth headset to your TV, HOWEVER, you need to make sure your headset has APT-X. Typical bluetooth has a very long delay. You will see the lips move before you hear the words. That will drive you crazy. Bluetooth with APT-X reduces that delay, but does not completely eliminate it. However you will need both the transmitter and receiver to have APT-X. This device can be used as your transmitter from your TV, but your headset ( the receiver ) must also have APT-X."
"What BlueTooth version is this? Is it 2.1, 3, or 4? That spec is not listed in the product description.","I don't have an exact answer for you but I'll tell you what I ""suspect"": This device uses Bluetooth A2DP, which is ""Adanced Audio Distribution Profile"", which has to be met independently of any Bluetooth version on your device. For example, I have an older LG phone which meets some basic Bluetooth protocols, yet it also supports A2DP so it could be paired to Bluetooth Stereo speakers, etc. I think if your device supports Bluetooth ""Stereo"", you're probably okay but it would need to be tested to be sure. Your question prompted me to read into a Wiki article about Bluetooth and it would seem logical that devices which support Bluetooth 2.0 + EDR would be the ones most likely to support audio, based on the wider bandwidth available (2.1 to 3 Mbit/sec) for supporting high-quality audio. The key, though, is to find something that specifically supports A2DP. If the other device supports aptX as well, that is an enhancement to the audio codec which will improve audio quality and reduce the latency of the transmission. (Nice but not necessary on the latter.) Hope this helps a little."
Can I use this device to connect my Smart TV and may Soundbar replacing the HDMI Cable?,"this is an awkwardly worded questions so I will try to answer it in parts. This device connects to any standard 3.5mm audio jack, which the back of your TV should have, as well as be in the back of the source of your sound bar. There is no HDMI cable to connect to this device. My advice, do not replace the HDMI cable from the TV to the sound bar, because you will lose so much audio quality. Instead, what I do is leave the Soundbar system plugged in with HDMI, but turned low/off for my sleeping baby, and I also play the TV sounds through this device connected to my AptX-enabled bluetooth wireless headphones (these are cheap and very simple to use = http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IBCRZ3Y/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1), and play as loud as I want."
Can the Avantee Saturn be left on charge indefinitely??,"Yeah, no problem. Don't worry :-)"
"what is the method of connection to a avr ? I only have 2 outouts , thr vcr out and md/cdr out/ will either one work for yx. I have plenty for inpu","Hello Arthur, I do not use this Bluetooth Music Adapter with AVR. I used this device as BT (Bluetooth) transmitter so I can listen to music in my PC with my BT stereo headset. Just simple connect this device to headset output from PC. This device is also a BT receiver, you can use it to receive from your BT devices (Iphone, smart phone ....) you will need a Y wire connecter to connect to L/R audio input of your AVR. I did not try this configuration yet. Hope this help. John N."
I am planning on hooking this to my car aux and leaving it in there.... does it autoconnect? or do you have to pair it every time it turns on?,"I needed to tell my phone to connect each time. I would also often have to unpair and re-pair to get it to work. Maybe I just had a defective one. Either way, I now use an Arcam r-blink and it is incredible."
I am trying to pair with an Audiosource Soundpop speaker but I cannot get the Saturn to recognize the Soundpop. Has anyone tried with this speaker?,I have no luck in paring
Will I get good sound quality from a non apt-X (i.e. Bose Soundlink) speaker? I'm not particularly concerned with a slight lag.,I use it both with my iphone 5 and IPad thru my Pioneer home sound system (non of which is apt-X) and the sound is close to CD quality.
Do you get a different indication for an aptX connection as opposed to a non-aptX connection? Jim,I never got to the point where I could try.
"f I connect this to my zune, then use my car stereo Bluetooth to connect to this device will I be able to change songs and vol. thru the stereo?","No. Zune does not receive bluetooth commands via stereo input. You could buy a zune dock v.2, connect this bluetooth adapter to the stereo output on the dock and use the zune remote to control to change tracks. The only car stereo that truly supports a zune, is Ford's Sync via USB. The exception is the 30GB Zune which suffers constant disconnects via USB."
"Can anyone please tell me how much the internet plans cost monthly for home wifi. Maybe around 15 Mbps, or more or a little less",The price is $54.99 monthly unlimited mbps hope that helps
"if you are not grandfathered in, is it still unlimited data on activation or capped data plans on sprint?","It is still unlimited data. They charge $39.99 for the slower speed & $54.99 for faster speed, but with either, you get unlimited data. I should add that I only did the activation online, not in a store, so stores might have different pricing."
can it replace dsl,Absolutely get this clear product then go online to clear.com and pick a plan enter the number on your modem and you will have internet with in 5 mins. I never have a problem with mine and I run two phones 4 tablets a ps3 and two smart tvs. Never had a problem. But call clear and make sure they cover in your area where you live. I absolutely recommend this product and clear internet. Hope this helps !
Can this be used for online gaming?,"it gives you max speeds of 12/1, it all depends on how far you are from their antenna Are those speeds good enough for you?"
Would I be able to get a new account and sign-in to the Clear and have the unlimited data if i purchase it since Clear is under Sprint now.,"Yes. I have been a happy Clear customer for over 3 years now, which is before Sprint bought the company. Once you get the Clear Hub Express, call them at (888) 888-3113, tell them you already have your own modem and set up service."
Is this all i need to play xbox live,i don't play xbox live but my grandson plays playstaion live on it and works great. go to their website..you put in your zip code to determine how may cell towers that will give you coverage..you do need to pay a monthly fee but it is very reasonable
Does this work with the Amazon Firestick? My other modem is too slow and the streaming has to buffer too long .. can't handle it.,"I'm not sure...but I play video games online,while surfing the net on my iPad and works amazingly"
Is it ok to leave the Hub plugged in at all times? I had the Spot Voyager and would only power it on when I needed the internet.,I have had mine plugged in all the time and it's fine.
"Can anyone tell me how to plug this thing? I mean does it come with a cable that you plug into an outlet, or does it come with a phonejack thingy?",Yes it is suppose to come with a plug for the wall outlet and for the phone jack
Does it work with Roku?,Yes. I have one and it works fine
can these glasses be connected to voice watches,"Stella, honestly, i am not sure. I don't have one of those watches and i never use these with my phone either. These are definitely cheap sunglasses but i have found them to be well worth the money. They are very easy to load and unload music from, they act just like a thumb drive when you plug them in. Their audio/sound is also quite good and the their lenses flip up or down, which is nice when i am running early in the morning and just want music to listen too. I also use them for radio sometimes but, depending on how rural/urban/metrapolitian an area you are in, some of the radio stations you want to listen to may not come in that great, while others may be just fine. I just tried pairing the sunglasses with my phone and it didn't seem to work but its possible that i would have to play with it a bit more to figure it out...my phone is also a couple of years old so its possible that it just doesn't pick them up for that reason (although i would expect it to be new enough to find them - my phone is an android operating system). By the way, if you do order them, just an FYI, they have directions in chinese and english but the english directions were not written by someone totally fluent in english, so, although you can figure out what they are trying to say by reading through them completely, some of the word choice is a bit off and you may have to decipher a little of it. Hope this is helpful. Justin"
"does this have a resume function, so it can be used for audiobooks",This glasses don't work
How do i use the bluetooth? I push the button that says bluetooth but i can't connect to it. And also it said FM radio but it clearly doesn't have on,I am not so sure that the glasses are compatible with anything. Mine were defective when I received them and would not turn off. They are a piece of trash! Good luck getting them to work.
how do u turn fm radio on,"To change from MP3 playback to the radio, you press both the volume up & down buttons for at least 3 seconds. BUT... I have returned two pair to Amazon because although the box mentions FM on the small label, they do not have that feature. All the ones I have that DO have FM have an FM sticker buy the left hinge (like the one on the right showing Memory). The actual FM equipped glasses also come with a different instruction manual that has FM information."
Can you put music on this item?,"Yes, any mp3 can be loaded onto and used on it as long as the file isn't corrupted"
How do I install the battery?,"The battery goes under the cap on the left earpiece. On the back of the speaker, twist the cap counter clockwise and it pops right off."
how do you unlock it????,Let me ask my son and I'll get back to you.
"Is there a warranty on this product? If so, how long is the warranty?","I bought this product and it did not work and when I tried to return it, I never got a response."
Can the G08 connect to two devices at the same time? Say a phone and an iPod? I haven't figured out how to do it.,I do not know if it can be paired to two devices.
Does this work with a TV?,it might but only if you have a wireless adapter than it might work
Where can the drivers for these headphones be found to install on a laptop so that they can be used with a pc?,"I never figured it out. I bought two. They really disappoint me. Even though I use cable to connect to the computer, there is noise. And the sound quality is not good. I don't even want to try for that blue tooth."
"how is the noise cancellation? (would it block out drums, lawn mowers, etc.?)",The Syllable G08 does an excellent job of noise suppression. Overall it is a good value. The only negative is the excessive bass.But that is tolerable.
Do these work with an ipod nano?,"If iPod nano has Bluetooth, Yes"
"I cannot get the Foreward and Backward buttons to work with my galaxy phone, also how do you pause?",Pause is the center button. No idea why your forward and back aren't working.
Does this work with a HP laptop with Vista OS?,"I assume that these headphones will work with any device that has bluetooth. However, I am not an expert. They work well with my Apple Computer and iPod Touch."
I'm assuming they will since they work with the BenQ W1070 but can anyone confirm if these will work with the new BenQ HT1075 projector?,They will work with any DLP 3D Ready system.
works for optoma hd25 lv ?,Yes
Will these work with the ViewSonic pjd5134?,They should work fine. The viewsonic pjd5134 is only 120hz but these glasses are supposed to be compatible with 120hz and 144hz. The viewsonic works with an Irish signal same as these glasses so you shouldn't have any problems with these glasses at all
"to recharge battery, is the usb charge line plugged into computer usb hub?",Yes you need to plug it into a USB port to recharge it.
will these work with benq w 770 st?,"Since I haven't tried these glasses with that particular projector I can't say with 100% certainty that it will work. However, an Amazon reviewer for the BenQ W770ST confirmed that these glasses did work for them and had great things to say about the 3D image. Hope this helps."
I have Benq w1070. Getting these glasses is enough for watching 3d movies? or do i need to get any other device to pair projector with glasses?,If your proyector it's DLP 3D Ready you won't need anything else. Look in the specs of your protector.
Does anybody know how to get 3D picture with Cyberlink Power DVD 14 + BenQ W1070 + SainSonic SSZ-200DLB?,"I dont know in your proyector, but in my proyector, I have to enter in the proyector's settings and then choose 3D mode, and pick a mode left-right or up-down, it depends, on what kind of 3D your movie is"
will this work with view sonic pjd5533w?,Yes
does this work benq mh 630,I know it works with benq w1070. There should be a compatability chart on sain sonic or benq website
Do these work with nvidia 3d vision ready displays?,"I don't know for sure, they are DLP screen sync shutter glasses. For some reason I seem to remember NVIDIA3d being RF synced?? Not light synced. But that is only from memory...sorry"
How do you secure this lock to the table?,"You can loop the cable around the leg or you can purchase another piece of equipment (as I have done) to secure it to the desk/table. I purchased the companion piece called a cable mount. I like my computer and what is on it, I would feel bad if I had the chance and I did not secure it and all I had to do was buy a couple pieces of hardware. http://www.amazon.com/Kensington-K64613WW-Mount-Cable-Anchor/dp/B0036RHAFM/ref=pd_sim_pc_1?ie=UTF8&refRID=0X50DNQ59NZRJ6VEVD21"
How long is the cable?,"I just measured it. It's 6 feet, tip to tip."
"Will this work on the 27"" 2014 iMac?","yes, I believe it will. The device attaches to the circular ring on the back of the stand. I am pretty sure that the ring is the same size as the 21in'' which is what I have."
Is there anyway to extend the cable?,The cable has the lock at one end and a loop at the other to wrap it to itself around the desk. I would assume you could loop another cable thru the loop side to extend it. The cable is pretty thick and I'm not sure how that would affect the warranty if it wasn't another Kensington cable.
"does this work with a 24"" imac? (FB418LL/A)","Assuming the ""base"" is the same whether 21"" or 24"" the answer would be yes. The locking of the Kensington device does not rely on a tight fit to the hole but rather sandwhiches the base between two halves of the lock. It is a stout lock and it should give a would-be thief a lot of trouble!"
"Can I run the power cable through the back hole? I saw you could run USB cables, but what about the Power cable?",Yes the power cable also runs through it.
Is the cable bolt cutter proof?,"The cable is made of carbon-strengthened steel. I'm sure there may be some bolt-cutter out there that could do the job, but not your ordinary bolt-cutter. I can't think of a safer solution other than locking your iMac up in a safe."
Can you fit an iPad wireless keyboard inside the folio?,"It depends on which wireless keyboard you get. If it is thin, then yes. I personally use the Lifescribe Bluetooth pen. It allows for the writing on the paper to be automatically transferred to the iPad. Then it can be converted to text. Which keyboard were you looking at?"
Can you use a smaller tablet on the side that holds the iPad without it falling out or does it HAVE to be an iPad?,The compartment is made to snugly fit an Ipad into. If you try for a smaller unit it will not fit securely. The smaller tablet should be as close to the dimensions of the Ipad as possible or it won't work.
Is the stand to support the iPad sturdy and dependable?,Folio is too big and plastic material quality is poor. I'm using Trent Airbender clamshell which is way much better.
IS THIS 100 PERCENT LEATHER,Its a nice case. Works very well for myself and team members. I would call it more of a 'pleather' than leather.
will it hold the ipad air securely? anyone know of a similar product for the air if not?,I doubt it would hold it securely.
Will it fit the Logitech Ultrathin Keyboard Cover Black for iPad 2 and iPad (3rd/4th generation) inside?,It would depend on the size of keyboard and how you rotate the tablet if a keyboard could fit. There's no actual slot for keyboards. I have never seen the Logitech Ultrathin Keyboard Cover so I really can't say whether or not it will fit.
"This is exactly what I am looking for to use with my Nexus 10. Will it work with my Nexus 10, or is a Nexus 10 version available?","Hi John, try looking for ASIN: B00FV8LMVM. This is for Google Nexus 10. Thanks for asking. Customer Care"

Anyone have problems with chimes as in can't hear the bell/song some days? Know how to fix it? (not volume problem),"Something must be wrong with your unit. Mine chimes as it is supposed to. If it works only sometimes, then the unit must be malfunctioning. My guess would be a loose wire or moisture in the unit. I'm just guessing though."
Does the system support a second monitor?,"Yes, it can suppot the second monitor."
How long is the cable from the camera to the mnitor?,"Hi, Cabel is short 10~15 as I can remember. I used cat5 To extend to more tnan 100 ft."
From where can I find extension cable? and what is the cable size/type for this machine?,"I'm not aware of where you can order cables with the connectors used for this device. However, you should be able to use regular twisted-pair networking cable to add length by splicing it into the provided cable. I'm not sure what length before the signal would degrade, but I would expect you could go 100 feet or more. Just some advice if you splice: don't cut too close to the connectors, in case you need to repair or re-do the splice in the future, you want to give yourself plenty of room (I'd splice at least a few feet from the connectors), AND if you're unfamiliar with splicing cable ask someone who does for tips on making solid connections. I honestly don't know where to get the connectors that they use, but they look like a common style of circuit-board type connectors, so I imagine there are electronic parts retailers or manufacturers that sell them somewhere. 20 years ago, I would have said ""go to Radio Shack"", but they haven't been much help recently with these kind of things. You should note, the connectors for the cameras are 4 pin, and the connectors for the control line between 2 monitors (if you have 2 monitors) are 5 pin."
How can I extend the cables using cat5e cables?,"Straightforward, simple splicing. If you've ever spliced phone wiring or network wiring, you'll be fine. If you've never done it or feel uncomfortable doing it, ask someone who has done it before to assist you or to show you how. The most important advice is, don't splice too close to the connectors - give yourself plenty of margin for error to cut off the spliced ends if you need to re-do it. (It may be difficult to find replacement connectors if you run out of wire.) I'd splice into the provided connecting cable at least a few feet away from one end."
May I have 2 more surveillance cameras to use with the same video?,Yes

what if you have another protector on the screen already (Ghost Armor or Zagg)?,"It will not hurt the phone, but you have to be patient with the touch screen. With the duel shields it's not as sensitve."
Does this camera have night vision to use for a baby monitor?,nope! that is the problem on this model. but phillips has a better one with night vision.
"Can I buy this, hook it up easily, and use it to view from my laptop? It says Iphone or Ipad. I don't have either one of those.","At the time of writing this, I have 5 of these cameras and it's only on iPhone/iPad."
can this work overseas??,"I wouldn't trust it. Mine lasted about six months where it worked great. Since then, I have been unable to view anything and have gotten no help from Philips how to resolve the problem. While it worked, it served the purpose. In all honesty, since you are hooking the video up to your iPad or computer, it should work wherever you have it."
Does this need to be plugged in ?,Yes
I have this product but it shows video has recorded however I can't click on it/watch it!! How can I see the video?!,Connect it to your Dropbox account if you have not. There you can see the videos. FYI it takes pictures @ videos

"does it have all the open space for all the plugs and front &amp; back camera, etc.?","No, we have to remove the cover to charge it and take pictures."

I want a compact inexpensive laptop for my boat that can run old chartkit cd's (for planning) and the occasional online movie. Would this one work?,I bought an apple ibook G4 for one of my children to use for homeschool. Even though it is used he has no problems whatsoever....sometimes it will run slow but I believe that has more to do with our internet speed than the actual computer....I actually like the preformance so much I will be looking to purchase 2 more for my other children...if you are familiar with Mac products then this would be a good purchase. Hope this was helpful
Can flash drives be used in the USB port?,Yes
I would like to use this computer for powerpoint presentations using CD disk and hooking up to internet for email. Is this good choice?,"I would say no. The equipment is so outdated, that most websites ask you to update your browser, and when you try to update your browser it says your cpu does not meet the minimum requirements."
"Hi, does it have a usb port to support a webcam?","Not sure, but we did hook up the iphone and down loaded photo's and e-mails..etc"

What is the modle number?? is this computer a wast of money?? Seems very cheap for Apple Laptop,"I bought it about 3 yrs ago and still use it. What you can't expect it to do is run anything that needs os10.6 or above. I use it basically as an internet machine although I still record music with garageband which is the main reason I bought it in the first place. If I were looking for an inexpensive mac right now I would get a later model macbook pro, like my wife has. I've seen them on Amazon used for.about 700 bucks and that is a lot of computer for that money She bought hers new from Amazon about 2 years ago for about 2300. If you could find one for 7 or 8 hundred bucks, that would be a good deal. It is, in fact, what I going to do in a couple of months."
"Is this capable of holding a Microsoft surface Pro 3? Dimensionally it should be, but curious if anyone has any firsthand experience.","I think so. I use it with my Transformer TF700T and it works great. I recently compared my tablet to the MS Surface and the size is similar with the Surface being a quarter inch or so taller. My thickness is about 1/4"" and similar to the earlier model Surface. The near 1/2"" thickness of the Surface Pro 3 is not an issue."
Will rear facing camera of ipad2 be unobstructed when in the mount?,I don't think so. The center piece is rather small. Go to ram mounts website to see the whole picture
Will this mount fit I-pad -4?,Yes
how does this thing work? why would i buy this when they don't have a decent picture of how this is functional?,"Four ""fingers"" grip the edges of the ipad in place and a built in spring mechanism provides enough tension to hold it securely. The other pieces visible in the not-so-great photo are for releasing the ""fingers"" by operating the spring mechanism. it sounds more complicated than it is. I use it in a P28A Archer III with my full-size ipad in the Apple-issue case."
"Is this the best RAM solution for a 10"" Samsung tablet if I want to have the longest side horizontal?",Works really well for an iPad in both portrait and landscape orientation so should be a good solution. I have not used it for a Samsung tablet.
"Which ball mount to use for the back of tablet holder? Will this one work? RAM Mounts RAM-B-238 RAM 2.43"" x 1.31"" Diamond Base with 1"" Ball","Yes, that is the one I use. This will mount to the back of the X-Grip. You will need an extension and base to mount to the other surface and may require another one of these depending upon which base you select."
A&Atilde;&ordm;n I use it for iPad 2 with survival protection?,"Mario, I don't know what 'survival protection' is. I have a Pong case on my iPad 2 that almost doubles the thickness of the unit and the Ram Mount X-Grip fits and holds securely while traveling in my motorhome. Order it, if you are not satisfied, return it to Amazon for a refund."
i have a transformer tf700 with a gumdrop case. will this item fit.,"It holds my iPad2 in a Pong case measuring 9-5/8""H X 7-1/2""W and about 5/8"" thick. I'd estimate the grip would hold a tablet 8.5"" wide. Height could be much more as it is not really a factor. Of course Amazon accepts returns if it doesn't work for you."
Will this work on an iPad 2,I have an ipad air it works great. Yes I am sure it will work with all ipads due to the adjustability of the unit.
Will this work for Lenovo IdeaTab K3 Lynx 11.6-Inch 64 GB Tablet? Does it have a VESA mounting holes so can attach to a LCD mount?,"I don't know , I would direct your question to Ram Mount. I have an iPad Air and it fits perfect if that's any help."

"Direct X 11 support? I want to play Shadows of Mordor and it requires that, my current card can't deal.","Yes, it offers support for DirectX 11."
Will this card work in hp envy desktop,"While I can't say for certain, it would very likely be a suitable replacement for onboard video in this machine, provided that the motherboard has the requisite PCI-E X16 expansion slot. I would not hesitate to give it a try, but you might check with HP support online or give them a call to inquire into compatibility."
Will this work with a second video adapter (so there are 4 monitors altogether)?,I believe it can but it depends on the other card/motherboard.
Will this work with a Dell OptiPlex 3020 Minitower pc?,As long as your Dell will take full height(not half height) cards it will work.
Will this work with a 300w PSU (power supply)?,From the website: Minimum of a 350 Watt power supply. (Minimum recommended power supply with +12 Volt current rating of 18 Amps.) Total Power Draw : 49 Watts http://www.evga.com/Products/Product.aspx?pn=01G-P3-2621-KR
What is a good replacement for a GeForce 8600 GT video card in an XP desktop?,"Should be. I can't make any promises, but this is a newer card which should be a good replacement for the card you mention. The only thing you would need to check is that it supports XP."

would this fit in my t450s?,No

Will this battery work in my SL410 Think pad??,"It probably will, but not absolutely certain. The statement on the Lenovo support site for this battery is ""Compatible with T410/20/30, T510/20/30, W510/20/30, L410/12/20/21/30, L510/12/20/30"" and you don't see ""SL410"" in that list. However, it appears that Lenovo often uses the same documentation for the L410 and the SL410. I don't know what the difference is between these two models, if any. Dig deeper into ""support.lenovo.com"" or take your chances and be ready to return to Amazon if it doesn't fit."

Does this battery stick out the back of the computer? My current battery sticks out and is quite heavy. I wanted one that is lighter weight.,"The battery does stick out the back, however my original one did also. If you want a high capacity battery, there is no way around it, it will weigh more than a lower capacity, I think the smaller one is about 2/3 the size, weight, capacity of this one, if you want light weight."
what is the watt-hour capacity? I can't believe the most basic info is not given in the product descriptions for any of these lenovo batteries!!,According to lenovo: * 6 cell system battery * Battery energy (Watt-hours): 63 Wh * Not compatible with the ThinkPad External Battery Charger (40Y7625) Average Battery Duration - 9.9hour

Will it work with other laptop brands i.e. Asus and Dell?,"Hi, This has a Lenovo specific port in the center which fits specific Lenovo models.

does this card have a 6 pin power connector like most other cards with this power?,"Actually, if memory serves, this card does not require the additional power provided by the 6-pin connector since it only draws 65W maximum. This card replaced my olde GeForce 9800 which did require the additional power connector and would pull well over 100W when the advanced graphics was in use. (verified with a watt meter). I will check my system this weekend since I am installing a new monitor and let you know."

I have an older machine right now and this was the best it could do. The results have been great. I am also using windows 8 as well."

Wondering if this card handle 2560x1440 resolution? How is it for video editing? Thx!,I doubt it would be good for your purposes. It's OK at 1080p but can bog down/stutter at times with a LOT of rapidly moving objects on screen - such as some parts of Guardians of The Galaxy.

The ADSL2 is for someone with DSL Internet service which is obtained over the telephone line. The Netgear Modem 3.0 is a DOCSIS type of modem designed for broadband cable internet, as in received over a coaxial cable such as a cable TV provider utilizes. Since I don't own a cable broadband modem, I couldn't say whether it is better than the ADSL one I purchased or not."

Will this modem work with the MTNL connection in Mumbai?,Sorry I have no idea...but mine did not last very long already replaced it
Does this fit for x220i?,Yes
is this lenovo battery in the original lenovo mfg packaging ? or it is in your own or generic packaging ?,"We are selling brand new, retail sealed Lenovo batteries. They are not our own/generic packaging."
Does it hold a loose charge to use as a spare battery?,We always keep the spare battery on a charger just to be safe since we are a medical practice. I purchased the battery charger from Amazon as well.
Can this be shipped to France ?,"Sorry, we don't ship internationally."
"It's abiguous if this works in all x220. One line (under from the manufacturer) says yes, the next no. I am unaware of a non tablet x220.","X220 should be an ultra notebook laptop, not a tablet. It works in my X220."
does this battery work with thinkpad x230t convertible laptop ?,"I'm sorry but I don't have an answer for that, as I have a different model and don't want to give you a wrong answer. Perhaps you can consult the Lenovo website?"
is original?,Mine was. But your mileage will vary from supplier to supplier.
Does this work on just the tablet or also the regular laptop?,"I don't know if it works on the tablet, but I know it works on the X230 and the T530 Thinkpads. So if you know, or have good reason to believe, it works on the tablet, then between us we know it works on both the tablet and the laptop."
Is this a genuine Lenovo Battery?,"Mine is, ordered this one via Amazon."
does this work for Lenovo thinkpad tablet? thanks,No. It did not. I told the company that they need to change the description.
I'm thinking of getting a monopod that holds up to 26 pounds. My camera and lens will weight almost 7 pounds. Will this tilt head hold that weight?,The load capacity on the head is 11 lbs. It's a very robust head but it is small and you may find the controls difficult to use if the camera is large. It should work fine with a 7 lb. camera and lens.
Will this head be good for video work?,If you are only looking for tilt head only it should work fine. You may be better off with a ball head that will tilt and pan right and left. I use this Oben on my monopod w/ a tele lens for shooting sports and have been very happy with it.
"Judging from the picture, this allows the camera to look up and down. Is that correct? That's what I need, not side to side.",Yes it tilts
Does this fit any Oben Monopod?,"I have a Oben ACM-2400 monopod and it fits. Since it comes with a 3/8""-1/4"" mounting threads, it should fit any Oben especially since it is the same product line."
Does the quick release work with a ARCA plate?,"It has it's own plate that allows it to go on and off the monopod, easily and quickly. you won't be able to use it with another plate. Great little unit."
Oben plate is compatible with manfrotto RC2 plate?,"Yes, it's compatible."
how do you remove the RP-20 plate from the VH R2 from the tilt head?,"It's very simple. Using the photo of the VH-R2 provided here, you will notice a small lever on the right side of the unit pictured. Using the index finger and thumb of your right hand, grasp and then pinch together the two ends of that lever and then move them in a horizontal direction away from you. By this action the two piece lever will then unlock and release the top RP-20 mounting plate which you will also notice pops up slightly. It can then easily be removed from the VH-R2. I recently purchased this top piece to mount on my Oben ACM-1400 mono-pod which came with a flat non-articulating head. The VH-R2 screws directly on to the original mount head. No tools required. I use it to better stabilize my video camera when taking telephoto shots on the run."
"is it supposed to attach to your monopod, or just sit loosely on top?",It attaches direct to the MonoPod as your Camera or Lens would.
Is the plate release lever also metal or plastic? Any general description of what is and isn't metal would be much appreciated! Thanks!,Lever is metal. Everything is pretty much metal except for the wing nut to adjust the tilt.
Does anyone know if this particular dock supports the w520?,Yes it does. I use it with my W520 all the time.
Will this support multiple displays on a W530?,I have mine set up for two monitors and it works beautifully
"Is there just the one usb 3.0 on the mini dock? I have two external hard drives, both usb 3.0.",Yes
Is Lenovo 433835U TP MiniDock Plus Series 3 170W Docking Station compatible with Thinkpad T540p laptop ?,You don't need 170W for the T-series; they only require 90W. The dock listed for the T540p is 40A20090US on the Lenovo website (find it under accessories for the T540p). I'd get the one specifically listed for the T540p to be safe.
This comes with the 170w adapter?,Yes.
Does anyone know if I can use the dock and the laptop without the laptop battery? Similarly to connecting the laptop to the adapter?,"Depends on the specific model. For testing purposes you can usually start a laptop without a battery, but is not a good practice. If it is a Dell laptop go to the Dell web site and research your model capabilities."
Does this doc support HDMI?,It does with a Display Port to hdmi adapter.
"Can you output UHD 3840x2160 @60Hz from a single DP connection, specifically with the ThinkPad W530 equipped with the NV K1000M GPU?",I have done this @ 30mhz but not 60. I have a Monoprice 4K monitor now and it can't drive it at 60mhz
"With T430s, how many monitors can I use?",This link will tell you the number of displays your T430 can support and in what configurations. http://support.lenovo.com/us/en/documents/ht075367
Will this dock display 64 bit software? I currently have a mini dock plus 3 (433810U) and am getting the blue screen of death. Using an x220 laptop.,"To my knowledge, video standards do not depend on the bit width of the connected-computer's CPU or, by extension, the software running on it. I can tell u I've been executing both 32- & 64-bit software running Win-7pro on a T530 operating in this dock w 2 external screens + the laptop's LCD with zero glitches. It's a dream machine."
Does it have many programs?,"It came with the basics. You have to add your own productivity software like MS Office. With the huge amount of hard drive space, you can add lots of programs. After a year, I am still very happy with the product."
how's the screen quality of this laptop? I bought a $700 Toshiba Portege before and the display showed some lines on it that really bothered me.,"i would say fairly good. probably not as good as a qosmio, but does the job"
"is the memory or the SSD self-upgradable? one user said it can't be done, can someone confirm?","both the memory and the SSD in U845-S406 are upgragable.Only for S406,i've no other type."
is the keyboard backlit,"No, it is not backlit."
this comes with recovery winows and driver cds included?,Recovery Partition &gt; Yes Install cd's/ driver cd's &gt; No
is THE DISPLAY HAVE A MATTE FINISH?,"Not really, but it's not so glossy either."
does it have web cam,Yes it does
How can I fix the faulty headphone jack?,"Hello and good day. After calling customer service,I ended up returning it to Toshiba to get fixed. Since then, no problem. I also had a faulty lamp."
Is there built in camera and mic on the laptop as there is no mention of them,yes there is a built in camera and mic
"hi, want to know if the laptop can come with no operating system?. Or if it is only with windows. Thanks",windows 7
How do I change the time from military to 12 hour system? It suddenly switched one day and I do not know how to change it back.,"There is a way to set time back to 12 hours, please contact customer service for the manual of set time back. You can reach them by email: cust.serv.ca@mcrgroup.com. Thanks"
Is this compatable with a gpx mp3 touchscreen?,"There is a 3.5mm Aux line in connector of this docking. So as long as your device has a 3.5mm Aux line in and cable of 3.5mm male to male line, you should be able to connect two devices, play music thru your touchscreen. Thanks"
Does this clock charge the ipod too?,"Yes, it charges iPod"
Does it work with an iPod 5th generation?,Hi I'm sorry I've only got it for my daughters iPod 3rd generation and it didn't work
"Is there an aux speaker outlet? If i wanted to plug in headphones to it, would it work?",There is an AUX in but no headphone jack on it. Most people would just plug a headphone into their iPod I guess. We use it just as an alarm.
does this work with the Iphone4?,"Greetings, I do not own an iPhone but it does work with the iPod Touch we own. I hope this helps."
What Lenovo model numbers does this battery fit?,"Mine is a t410. Here are all the others. Compatible with These Original Part Numbers: 42T4708 42T4709 42T4710 42T4712 42T4714 42T4715 42T4731 42T4733 42T4735 42T4737 42T4753 42T4757 42T4799 42T4801 42T4803 51J0499 51J0500 57Y4185 57Y4186 ASM 42T4703 ASM 42T4711 ASM 42T4752 ASM 42T4756 ASM 42T4794 ASM 42T4796 FRU 42T4702 FRU 42T4710 FRU 42T4751 FRU 42T4755 FRU 42T4791 FRU 42T4793 FRU 42T4795 FRU 42T4797 FRU 42T4799 FRU 42T4801 FRU 42T4803 FRU 42T4817 FRU 42T4819 Fits Machine Models: ThinkPad E40 ThinkPad E50 ThinkPad Edge 0578-47B ThinkPad Edge 14"" ThinkPad Edge 14"" 05787UJ ThinkPad Edge 14"" 05787VJ ThinkPad Edge 14"" 05787WJ ThinkPad Edge 14"" 05787XJ ThinkPad Edge 14"" 05787YJ ThinkPad Edge 15"" ThinkPad L410 ThinkPad L412 ThinkPad L420 ThinkPad L421 ThinkPad L510 ThinkPad L512 ThinkPad L520 ThinkPad SL410 ThinkPad SL410 2842 ThinkPad SL410 2874 ThinkPad SL410k 2842 ThinkPad SL510 ThinkPad SL510 2847 ThinkPad SL510 2875 ThinkPad T410 ThinkPad T410i ThinkPad T420 ThinkPad T510 ThinkPad T510i ThinkPad T520 ThinkPad W510 ThinkPad W520"
Does this fit a Thinkpad W500?,I bought it for Thinkpad T-Series and it worked well with it. I am not sure about W-Series.
Is this battery compatible with ThinkPad Edge 14 0578A99?,Yes I have the same model laptop and it works fine gives a backup of 100-120 mins
Is this battery compatible with ThinkPad Edge 14 0578A99?,"Hello, I'm not sure about the last digits, but I have one in my ThinkPad Edge 14, seems to do ok...think I've had it just over a year...and it still holds its charge, obviously not as long as in the beginning. I'm glad I got it. Hope that helps a bit. :)"
"how durable is it, and what's the warranty policy?","I don't know about their warranty, but my battery still holds a very strong charge to this day. I've been very pleased with this battery."
will this fit the cannon eos 70D?,It depends which lens you have. Please tell me which lens an I can double check for you.
I have a 28-135mm Lens. Does it fit that one? I have a Canon EOS 40D.,"I don't believe this one will, you need a 72 mm hood for your lens."
Will it work with 18-55 mm Cannon Rebel T3 ?,"It should work as long as the threads on the inside of the front of the lens are 58mm. On my lens, it had 58mm written just on the inside lip and I would look there to confirm whether it will fit or not."
Will this hood fit the Canon 50mm F/1.8 lens?,It doesn't fit mine!
what is the purpose of a tulip lense hood? does it keep out light and if so why reverse it?,It keeps light out. It can be reversed for storage. Makes the camera more compact while keeping the lens with the camera.
"Does this lens hood screw on to the filter threads, or does it bayonet mount directly to the outside of the lens body?",Mine screws on to the filter threads.
does this support DELL u3011 2560x1600 duallink?,Works very good. No issues. Installed easily.
Can I use this chip with a 32-bit operating system?,"To my knowledge you can. Most of the hardware to my knowledge is backward compatible. So if you had a 64-bit processor for instance, you can still run a 32-bit operating systems, you just wouldn't get the speed or efficiency that 64-bit brings. As far as graphics cards, I'm pretty sure the only thing you need to make sure is compatible is your motherboard, and you can find the specs in the motherboard documentation. If you don't have the documentation, search for the motherboards company website, say for instance your motherboard is an Intel motherboard, then search for the Intel website. You will most likely need the model of the motherboard as well."
does this card come with a dual cable splitter DVI to VGA?,It comes with a dvi to vga adapter.
Can I hook up 2560X1440 to this card?,"Yes, I have my 27 inch apple monitor connected via display port."
will it support windows 8,Yes I have it running on Windows 8.1. Started with windows 8 works great.
Do you have low price and low profile graphics card to support three independent display outputs port?(3 monitor),This is the lowest priced 3 monitor card that I could find. Quite happy with it.
Is it low profile? It support window 7?,"This PCI card is the standard size, not low profile. I put it in my Dell Optiplex 745. It should support Windows 7 as long as you can find the drivers. I run Linux so I don't have a definate answer about Win7 support."
Is it low profile,"It's normal card size, so fits easy into regular slot. Heat sink is thick so about same width as the external bracket. and, of course, the card is not full length. I really like the card, as it drives my Dell 30"" 2560 x 1600 and another monitor Dell 27"" - 2560x1440 at same time."
Has this card two DVI-I dual link ports as the photo shows? Can I use 2 dvi-to-vga adapter and one minidp-to-vga simultaneously?,Yes. You can use all 3 ports at the same time. I ran this setup on my box with no problems. I don't think the type of adapter you're using matters.
What is the difference between this one and the 900614 which is $100 cheaper?,"It doesn't look much different to me except for that eyefinity technology but it claims to do the same thing. I had to put a new power supply in with my Video Card, a Corsair 600W. The one you're looking at only requires 300W or better so you wouldn't have to swap out your power supply unless you're looking for AMD Crossfire technology, you'll have to go to a 400W power supply. My video card is very big and take up a lot of room. For the money, it looks like you have a found a comparable card for $100 less. I have had no problems for a year with my card and just this past Sunday, removed it and put it in my new PC with no issues. Good luck sir."
How long is this card? I don't have much room in my case. Thanks,"You'll need at least 10"" to clear both power connectors."
What actually comes in the box? What adapters are included?,"The card, 4 displayport to minidisplayport adapters, and two single link dvi to minidisplayport adapters"
Can any of you tell me what motherboard you are running with this card?,I am using this: ASRock Z87 Extreme6 LGA 1150 Intel Z87 HDMI SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.0 ATX Intel Motherboard
are the mDP ports 1.1 or 1.2?,according to the manufacturers websites they are 1.2 http://www.visiontek.com/7000-series/hd-7870.html
I have an AMD radeon HD7700; is this a good upgrade? compatible?,"In term of processing power the Visiontek 7870 is great. I run 6 monitors, and have background processes running Litecoin GPU mining and the card ticks along wonderfully. The issue comes when you NEED to run 6 monitors. There seems to be a systemic fault with the cards, reported by many users, where one of the miniDP output blanks intermittantly though regularly (every few minutes) when under load. This is frustrating, very distracting and means you can't reliably use the 6th monitor. Using an MST hub does not fix the problem - the issue seems to be further back in the processing chain than the output itself."
"Is the 7870 restricted to 1920X1080 6X27"" monitors? Or will it run 6X27"" 2560X1440 without drag?",Sorry not to be helpefull. The board is already installed at a customer site and running. We didnt try that maximum to see if it works. Hope someone has tested and can help.
Is this card loud? I'm thinking about getting a new graphics card. My current card - GeForce 310 (512 mb) is very quiet. I want something comparable.,Is kind of quiet I think but I won't lie to you I use this card at work and sometimes is kind of loud there
I have 6 televisions in portrait mode (vertically) I need to display a single picture on 3 and a video on the other 3. Will this card work?,"This card is one of the biggest pains to set up. I have been building computers for about 15 years and I have never had as many problems as I had with this one. I normally do not buy AMD, but, with my research, this seemed like it was going to be a home run... there was too much hype with this card. I put this in two separate computers that I was building simultaneously, one with 6 monitors and one with 4. The four works great, but the 6 had to be downgraded since no matter what I did, it wouldnt display correctly on all 6. I tried all different configurations and even bought all six certified converter (DVI to mini display) cables that this card recommended. I think your best bet is that if the TV has mini display to utilize those connections. The key is having active adapters (which I thought would fix my problem when I purchased a total of 6 adapters)."
Does the AMD RADEON HD7870 Eyefinity 6 ED Graphic Card support 6 separate programs or applications at one time on each monitor as well?,"Yes, you can have each monitor showing something different. Each monitor can be at different resolution. For example, I have one monitor that is 4k while the other monitors are not. I have some monitors that are the same size and some that are not. I have one monitor that is always playing a movie while the others are doing other things."
does it have a camera,The one I bought does have a camera.
what does 4th generation mean,Not way too sure but the difference between it and the 5th generation is the 4th doesn't have a camera built in it.
can you get ios 6 or 5,No
"Can you install apps such as Kik, Instagram, and so on ?",No ios is too low
could it download games?,If you have a newer version mine doesn't
can you text ?,If you have internet connection and you download the text application from the app. store then the answer is yes you can text.
will these fit on the fairing of a 2014 street glide special?,If you have the new vented fairing wing not sure. They fit my 2012 Street Glide and I am very satisfied with the product. Just make sure of the screw length for each hole when mounting the adapter. Shorter ones on the bottom.
"will these adapter rings work with 6"" speakers? TIA",No
"can these same 6.5"" adapter rings be used on the fairing lowers of the harley davidson road glide","D. Schluter, I may have mis-answered your question and thought you were referring to the fairing. For lower fairings, you shouldn't need this type of adapter, the speakers should fit in your lowers speaker housing, which is a completely different type of kit."
Will this work for the mobigo ? My daughters has the first Mobigo.,"I would not recommend purchasing this as I bought it for the VTech Innotab 3 (stated it was compatible with it), and it is not. I would check first with the manufacturer of Mobigo to find out if they have these items and if so, buy from them. It may cost a tad more but worth it to know it will work."
will it fit my innotab3s?,It fits but it's not a charger. It is a power cord only. My son had to stAy plugged in to use it.
Does it work for Innotab 3,Yes it does. We bought it just for our daughters innocent tab 3
Does work for VTech InnoTab 2 Learning App Tablet,"To be honest i am not sure. I have the InnoTab 1. As long as the adapters are the same shape, i dont see why this wouldnt work! :) sorry i couldnt be of more help."
Will this work with a Vtech Mobigo 2?,"I am not familiar with the Vtech Mobigo 2; however, I would go to the Vtech website and place your question there for their customer service to assist you."
Does this work for innotabbaby 2,Not really sure didn't get it for that.
"I am thinking about buying this for my son's V.Reader, I see all the other Vtech toys, so I assume that it will work, but I would like confirmation?","It will work,to stay plugged at the wall while he plays,it doesn't charge it,just keeps it running while plugged in."
"I bought this wall/car charger combo it said it was for the innotab however the wall charger does not fit my inno tab, how do I resolve this issue? A",I bought two of these for our innotabs and they fit fine. Are you sure that you are not trying to plug it into the headphone jack???
How do you charge the J lab go wireless Bluetooth?,It comes with a mini usb charger that plugs into the wall
What version of bluetooth does this headset have?,"I am not sure, but it works with my samsung Galaxy S4 and my iPhone 4 & 5"
"Will it work with a ASUS memo10"" tablet and what is the warranty? Ready to buy just need to find out if this will work with my tablet.",Could never get it to work with my husband's iPhone 4. I would not recommend because we could never get it to work and returned it.
Can you use them to watch a movie on your phone or tablet?,Sure but it is very uncomfortable
Can you wear these outside in the rain when you are running?,They are not billed as waterproof. I wouldn't try it.
What's the audio latency on this unit? Can it handle movies w/o lip-sync problems?,At least 4 hours
Do these connect to iPod Touch?,If it has Bluetooth
do these heaphones use sd cards?,No.
can i skype on it?,"Yes Karen, you should be able to do it and it clearly says on it. There's one problem though which is luck with HP products. I had bought quite a few of their top of the line desktop and Envy laptops. Few of them had unrelated problems and I switched to Mac computers. I couldn't be happier. Back to your question, I absolutely see no reason why you should have any trouble, and then Amazon's service is amazing anyway!"
does it have the glossy or anti-glare screen?,"Answer here...Anti glare I believe. Please read through comments. This situation gets worse. I believe the seller through Amazon,Legendary Juny, sold us a used unfunctional computer. It was said it was purchased on July 4, 2013. There were entries made on July 13, 2013. We didn't get it until July 29, 2013, although we paid for it on July 8, 2013. HP refuses to replace the machine. They say it isn't there fault. Legendary says we did something to it! Isn't this just all awful. I have been trying to be reasonable in bad circumstances and the responsible parties are passing the buck. We could have just demanded our money back! This legendary person doesn't stand behind there sales! Amazon doesn't either and HP doesn't want to get stuck holding the bag is how we are seeing it. I will never buy much of value from Amazon again. The computer costs us $ 911.48. Buyers Beware! Unhappy customers"
Anygood for gaming?,"Probably, I have this model but I don't play games so I wouldn't really know. Check out HP's website for reviews of this model: http://www.shopping.hp.com/en_US/home-office/-/products/Laptops/HP-Pavilion/A3G47AV?HP-Pavilion-dv7t-7000-Quad-Edition-Entertainment-Notebook-PC#pdpreviews"
backlit keyboard?,Not that I have discovered how to implement if it is available within the four corners thereof.
heat issues,"I have no heat issues, a lot cooler then my old HP computer."
backlit keyboard?,"No, the computer has a standard, full-size keyboard- but not backlit."
Is it a dv7t-7000 or a dv7t-6100,It is a dv7t-7000.
What is it your selling? A laptop 0r just a motherboard . Andrew,laptop
is this Windows 7 PRO or just the home edition?,Windows 7 Home Premium.
Am I the only one who finds the USB ports poorly placed within 1-2 inches of the front of the machine. What can I do about this problem?,"I would say with any new tool, it is a matter of getting used to the difference. Not a big deal for me."
"Possible to use on non-Mac 11.6"" laptops?",Not likely due to overall thickness. Most ultralights are still thicker than a MacBook Air
What are the dimensiones?,"The unit I purchased fits exactly over the Macbook Air 11"" and fits very snugly, with no extra play. This is a very beautiful and high-quality black soft leather sleeve, and I get compliments on it constantly. A great and expensive-looking protection for your Macbook Air."
"Is this sleeve stiff. In other words, is there like a hard plastic under the leather to give it strength or is just pure leather and flimsy?",There is no plastic under the leather so it is just pure leather. The quality is quite good though.
"Title says ""DISC Support"". What does this mean?","It says ""M-Disc support"". M-Disc is a type of recordable media that doesn't use an organic dye, but rather an inorganic layer. Basically, this is a side standard of optical discs that are designed to not ""overdevelop"" the way that polaroid photos did. (meant to last and last) The mention of it in the title is just to let you know that among all the other types this drive can use, M-Disc is included."
"Will this allow me to download programs to my laptop? i.e. greeting cards, turbo tax, etc","yes you can use this Lg dvd player to load programs on your laptop,netbook, or even computer. Many coputer techs like to use this unit... i love mine"
on Macbook pro?,yes this lg disc player is compatable with mac or windows units
Is it compatible with Windows 8?,"Yes, it is compatible."
Can this DVD R/W drive be used with a MAC?,"Yes, it can. I have used it on two MacBook Pro's. One caveat is that if you have an older MacBook where each USB port is on opposite ends of the laptop, you'll either need a USB extension cable or a powered USB hub. However, I can only attest to the hub solution. I haven't tried it with an extension cable but I pretty sure that it would work."
Can I plug this into my LG TV to watch movies?,"Suzi - I think that you need a DVD ""Player"" for that job. This is a DVD ""read/write drive"". This DVD ""read/write drive"" WILL play your movies on your computer; but I do not think so on your TV."
Does this product work with MacBook Pro? I have OS 10.5.8. Thanks,"Should work just fine with all Mac OS 10 versions. I'm running 10.8 on a MacBook Pro but it's a standard protocol. Note that for a MacBook Pro you won't be able to plug both USB cables (one for data, one for power) without a usb extension cord because the MacBook only has one port on each side, too far apart for the caple supplied to stretch. However, it will read DVDs OK with only one usb connection - I think it only requires the extra power when it's writing."
"Does anyone know if I can play DVDs from any region on this? I have my laptop on region 2, but would like something to play region 1","yes, download a program/player called VLC"
Does this play CDsas well?,"It plays CDs , but this is a portable DVD/cd player to be hooked to your computer by a USB cable"
Can I uses this with Windows xp running on an Asus Eee Pc?,I'm running XP media edition and it was plug and play for me .
Will it accept 4TB drives?,"Yes, the n5550 will take up to 5 - 4TB drives."
Can you set up jbod as 4 independent disk or does it merge them into one drive?,JBOD or even a mix of different RAID arrays (i.e. a 2 drive RAID1 and a 3 drive RAID5) is possible.
"Does this matter which 4TB NAS drives I use? 5400 vs 7200 rpm? Primarily use is for backups, streaming home videos and photos via Plex","I would recommend using one on Thecus's compatibility list: http://www.thecus.com/download/compatibility/hdd/N4520SERIES_N2800_N4800_N4800Eco_N5550_N4510U_N7510_HDD_SSD_list.pdf Also consider that Enterprise rated drives will last longer and potentially perform a bit faster, but might not be worth the price bump for just backups."
Compared to the other nas postings this is showing as if it includes hdd totaling 20g. is this unit diskless?,Yes it is diskless. You can chose what size disks you want for the total size
Do it cover international warranty ?,"In korea, it is not warranted."
Does this NAS support VMWare images?,"This will support a VMware image over a LAN connection, I would suggest using the aggregated ethernet option which this also supports. DO NOT do anything funky like running encrypted RAID 0/1/5 etc. Run an ext3 (limit 16GB file size) with what ever flavor of raid you like. This will not be fast but will work.

I can tell you that I tried to use it (and another HP) for my DJ business and it performed horrible with the software. I couldn't get it to work right at all, it kept skipping on songs and randomly ""popping"" along with other problems. I was in a pinch one night at a birthday party and ended up using my wife's 300 dollar bottom of the line Gateway computer and it performed 100% better than this HP. I used to love HP but now I cannot recommend them. Hope this helps."

I think it's light weight will be a + as well. I say smaller collection because this laptop is definitely well rounded for personal use. If it's strictly music (non video & pictures), it will be solid. I'd also suggest staying with the Windows 7 this laptop comes with. It's way more solid & reliable than Windows 8 or 8.1.

Can a gtx 780 acx be able to fit in this case?,yes but you have to mod it a little bit. http://www.overclock.net/t/1174563/silverstone-ft03-ft03-mini-owners-club/1170

Cable lengths can be dealt with if you spend time routing it well, but I recommend making short PSU cables or buying some."
i have macbook pro 13 retina and i want to know if the anti dust pieces fit it?,"Don't get them, they are cheep but a waste of $. They will fall out and get lost and unless your on a construction site you would never need these. Just get some caned air and clean them out once a month. And if you do get them DO NOT use the long one that covers the air vent, I did that and over heated my hard drive."

Can I use this for a macbook air 1466?,"I don't know if they fit for 1466. But for mine, some parts fit, some parts don't. Generally, I don't think it is necessary to use these anti-dust items. I just abandon all these items."
can I use this for the mac book pro A1278?,yes you can :)
How do you insert and remove these?,"It's extremely easy, just match up the slots until they are completely in each hole, the you pull them out the same way. I keep a very small zip lock bag in my purse/ laptop to put them in when needed. Just keep an eye on them, incase they fall out. I have 3 sets, just incase I lose one or 2. I have different colors for fun!!! They are great in keeping the dust out of your laptop. Dust is a killer of electronics. Good luck!!!"

"it says there is a built in rechargeable lithium battery yet when i plug it in to charge, it does not charge?","Mine appears to already be fully charged, so I can't tell yet. I'd have to run it down a while, I guess. Does yours not record anymore? I'm also not sure how it indicates when it is in the charging mode. If I learn more I'll get back to you."
Is this item compatible with Windows 8?,"I have windows 8.1 and it works fine, one thing I notice some times when transferring recordings to laptop with windows 8.1 it stop transferring I notice is because to save the battery the device turns off but turn it on again and try transfer again and it always work well. Hope that helped"
Does is it have a built in microphone or you need to connect one to record?,Yes it has a built in mic.
"How does it last on standby and on recording time, battery wise?","Hello, I would say it works very well in all areas. My complaint is that it seem to record in WAVE format.

can you connect 3.0 or 2.5 audio jacks,"Hello Humberto R. A real good question, I check the manual on it and check the jacks that came with it but it doesn't say. I have plug in my head set from my cell phone and it work. Sorry that I couldn't answer your question."

Why do i only get a blue screen when i connect my cctv camera ???,"Because it, your camera, or you are broken"
i lost my power cord how can i order another one,I highly doubt they sell replacement parts for this. It would be easier and probably faster to get another power cord from RadioShack
it says still photos from the rear and video from the front true? and I need some hi res hd mini cam for the unit can you recommend something?,"Yes you need to push a button on the unit for the second camera to take a snapshot Look for something with 700 or more lines of resolution the lens and field of view is just as important though It depends on what you need to do. Think about that before you buy, Box cameras with a ""C"" mount lens is the way to go. They sell adaptors for those so you can screw on a big telephoto lens like they used to use with film cameras. The Go pro camera has been used in full length movies for in vehicle shots and it's pretty good. You wouldn't need the DVR with that if you need sound don't forget the mic. They have a few 12 volt units that can hear a pin drop."
"When is worked with 2 cameras, two of them record video, or one record video and the other snapshot?","With two cameras, two of them will record video. Consequently, it the setting is on snapshot, then it will take snap shot pictures."
Could you give me the exact name of the power cable.,"Mine came with ""Foxlink"" AC/DC adaptor. Input 100V~240VAC. Output 12VDC at 2.0Amp. Looks like a laptop charger. The DVR has two jacks. Input is for the power supply and a second identical jack which outputs 12VDC to supply power to an external camera. Any power supply with 12VDC @ 2.0Amps will work. Just need correct tip. Radio Shack would be first stop or electronics stores if looking for replacement."
"Can I use this in my home , and could I use it with a HDE 48 IR ccd indoor dome cctv camera, and do I get all the accesories that is shown in the pict","You could certainly use it in your home and it does come with the accessories shown but I do not know about the cctv camera. That said, I don't know why it wouldn't work. It's working in my application. I'd say try it and if it didn't work, send it back. At $60 it is cheap enough."
"can i have the manual for this unit on line, i can't record .","I Can try to find it for you but its a terrible Chinese Manual mispellings and it doesnt say a word about what the 2 small plugs are over all it turns good video to terrible video, doesnt record fast enough for smooth video in even 640x480 anyway mines in a drawer lol if i have the manual ill scan it and email it if you like just leave an email Robert"

how are the settings changed on this unit? does it require special software? I have this but the buttons on the unit do nothing.,You don't need special software. The controls are on top of the device
"Would you recommend this for outdoor use? If not, is there a way to protect it from the elements?","I used it indoor only, it works quite well, not too difficult to configure. I doubt this will work outdoor under weather conditions. Temporarily, on clear skis day it could work."
Will this camera work if I put it on the windowsill pointing outside? Obviously the window would be inches from the lens so wondering?,"During the day it will work, but there might be some reflection depending on the angle and amount of light inside. At night the infrared light will reflect back to the camera and give you glare and it will be impossible to see any thing outside. You can tape over the infrared lights and then put a separate infrared light outside if needed."
I can't find the original disc that came with my camera and I need to set it up again. Where can I download the software?,http://agasio.com/downloads/IPCamSetup.exe
is there glare protection,yes there is. I used it outdoors a number of times without any issues.
how to apply the screen protector?,"On each side there is a little white strip. One with blue print and the other with red print. Red is step 1, peel that side odd but make sure that the screen is completely clean first. Btw, these fit the Galaxy Tab 2 PERFECTLY, as in there will be NO gaps around the edge so take your time lining it up. Start at one end and use the card to smooth out the bubbles. Once you have it down pull on the blue strip and the top layer (which is a thicker plastic will come off. When it's on there you won't even notice it has a screen protector on it. Just like the Invisaguardz shield I have on my Galaxy S4 Active (those are scratch proof and made of tempered glass) The most helpful tip is to be patient and take your time. I hope that helps."
s-pen,No
is it matte finish or gloss?,"It is clear, once you put it on the screen it blend with the screen glass. It is not matte as it look in the picture."
will this work with the Tab 3?,"The amFilm itself should work fine with the screen of the Tab 3. However keep in mind that the Tab 3 is smaller than the Note 10.1which is the one I bought. You'd have to specify which tablet you have so that you can get the right size for your tablet. It works great with my Galaxy Note 10.1, I hope this helps you :)"
Do it come in other colors ? Is it sturdy and hold ipad secure ?,"I don't think it does come in dofferent colors. The color of mine was the picture. I thought it held my iPad 2 very well. It would held in place pretty securely, and I could easily pop it out when needed. I loved it."
Can I use this with an iPad Air,I have the iPad 2. Is there a size difference between iPad2 & air?
Does it have rubber on bottom to prevent sliding or scratching on smooth surfaces,"unfortunately no. There's no rubber at all inside the iPad shell part itself. Just little edges sticking out to hold it in and from falling out. But they're not that difficult to deal with. I found it fairly easy to lightly snap mine in and pop it out as well. The pictures do it it's justice. I mean the pics didn't show any rubber in/on it, and it didn't come with it."
How long does it take to charge and how long does the charge last?,About an hour to charge. The charge can last 2-3 days.
Does anyone know how to make sure it is charging? I don't know what the buttons do and the instructions are no help.,"If you slide the button on the far right to the ""0"" position it should show green. Red or yellow indicators mean that it needs charging."
can this item be used with first generation ipads?,I know it works with the IPAD 2 other than that I don't know.
How heavy is it?,"it's light, but you shouldn't buy it, it isn't solid at all."
Does it charge up the phone as it is playing,"No, it doesn't charge :( But it has been a great purchase for the money! :)"
I keep my phone in an Otterbox. Do I have to remove it to use this speaker system?,I wouldn't even get it if I were you. I got one and one of the speakers stopped working within like 2 weeks and I didn't even use it that often.
how many batteries do you need to use?,Don't bother it doesn't work at all anyway
does it work with the iPhone 5,"Yes, and I actually just upgraded from my iphone 5 to a 5c and it also works with that."
will this work for the iphone 5?,yes
does the Naztech N40-119117 charge phone,No it does not charge the phone. It has 2 cords. 1 to plug into the iphone/ipad and one usb port. The usb port hooks into a computer for power. Otherwise you have to have 8 batteries for power.
Does it take the standard AC adapter?,"I'm not sure what is meant by a ""standard"" AC adapter. It takes a standard 6V adapter. Use a standard 12V adapter and you'll fry it. Hope that helps."
Does e Naztech N40-119117 comes with AC power cord?,Mr. Carlos Gonzales..the naztech N-40 comes with a (DC 6V conection to USB) cable..
is this a wireless system,No. The satellite speakers connect to the sub woofer by wires.The sub woofer connects to the television by optical wire.
"Does this system go into ""standby mode"" if it doesn't detect an audio signal? If so, does the green power light indicator dim or go off?","Yes, It does go off when doesn`t detec an audio signal and the green light goes off."
"Hello, Does this model need an amplifier? I'm confused with the other model.",The amplifier is contained in the sub woofer unit. You do not need any thing else to connect this to your TV. (You can also connect blue tooth devices and use a cable with mini stereo jacks or even RCA plugs.)
How would I get a replacement remote for this model? My children lost it and it is gone!!! Maybe thrown in the garbage : (,Logitech sells remotes (get their cheap ones no need to spend too much). They have a database online to program it to control the Boston Accoustic Soundware XS. I made sure that another remote can learn its commands before buying this thing because that remote is SMALL. Hope it works for you!
What is the power input for the sub?,"if by ""power input"" you mean AC wall current, it is standard 110 volt/60 cycle- if you mean what amount of power the audio inputs can accommodate, I would think a preamp would be sufficient, I use the headphone output from the TV/CD player to drive mine. I hope this helps."
Do the speakers play well with a Roku streaming device as well as a Dish hooked to the tv also? Is there any other component needed?,I do not use either Roku or Dish network but it will work fine because it is not depend on any other component you use. it uses audio out of TV (I use optical out) for an input. So it is not depend on what is your picture source. All the components you need come with the box.
voltage?,"Its definitely 110v, and I think it's also 250v."
Can I plug the RCA connectors output from the sub to the RCA ones located in my cable provider box?,I would think the RCA components would work with any standard RCA's; I've used them with various audio sources and my own cable box / DVR (DirecTV).
"Am I able to hook up the slightly larger Soundware speakers instead of the XS speakers to this XS ""system"" (sub)?","According to the specs, they are both 8 ohm speakers and both have about the same wattage. I have used the slightly larger Cambridge Soundworks Satellite Speakers and they worked perfectly. As long as the speakers don't require more power than the amp can push you shouldn't have any problem using the ""slightly larger"" speakers."
Does the XS support discrete power on and off codes when using programable remotes like a Harmony? (Instead of only toggling power on and off),We use Harmony remotes on both of ours. It's a toggle.
Does it charge your iPhone? And does it plug into the wall?,It does plug in but does not charge your phone.
did a USB cable come with it?,No it did not. It comes with a power cord or you can put batteries in it. Its cheap but decent product. I've had it for 6 months now and it works perfect.
do u have to take your case off for it to work,No you do not have to remove the case for it to work

Hi... Can use this for ANDROID phones? example.. Huawei G610? thnx...,Don't think so. I wouldn't recommend it anyway. Had to return one bc it was broken upon arrival and the replacement was sub par
does it support the Ipod touch 5/ iphone 5,I believe it does. My stepson has a iPhone 4 and he says it works fine.
does it work with a nokia phone ?,"I've only used the iPhone with it, so I can't say for certain, but I would assume so. It has a regular aux. plug (like headphones) so if your Nokia phone has a regular aux. input, it should work fine."
does it some with a 3.5mm audio cable?,Yes it comes with a 3.5mm audio cable.
Naztech N40-11915 Portable Speaker System Dock also compatible for blackberry Z10,I think so. As long as it has a headphone jack.
Where can I purchase the A/C adapter for this item?,"Their are many place because an A/C adapter is a power supply and it can be found at stores like bestbuy, target, or you can purchase it online, but be specific you don't want a random adapter it must be for the thing you want to use it. One more thing for these speakers Naztech N40-11916 Portable 4 AA batteries will work as well if you do not want to buy a power source. Hope that answered your question:)"
How loud does this speaker get?,"I don't know the maximum volume, I don't have a dB meter, but it gets plenty loud enough to listen to music at my desk, I plug it into my Android phone and listen to internet radio just fine. You're not going to be able to use it for a party or anything though."
Does this charge the phone as well?,"No, it doesn't charge the phone at the same time."
Will a htc one work on it?,I'm not quite sure. If your HTC has a place to connect ear plugs then I would think it would work. It comes with the connections. All I did was put it in the hole where I would normally plug in my ear plugs and the music will play.
is this Nikon d3200 camera a real nikon camera and NOT some knock off (imitation)? does it comes with USA warranty?,"if your buying one only buy it directly from a company, you can't expect to get a warranty on used items sold here and places like eBay. I would find a place going out of business or buy direct from amazon fulfillment. otherwise I don't know if nikon USA.com will let you buy an extended warranty. if you care bought a warranty buy it from someone I wouldn't buy from eBay. 90% of the stuff there is counterfeit. and horrible? you'll have better luck with amazon? remember a standard kit for nikon d3200 is bought 600 with one lens, check the website listed above. in this response"
"Is the warranty issued by NIKON for the USA? If I take this camera to a Nikon-authorized center in the USA, will they honor this warranty?","Yes if you buy it from the right seller on here. I bought this from SuperFinds and there model is a Imported or Gray Market Item which means no USA warranty, and I returned it. Then I did some research and found out that Beach Camera and Cameta Camera are authorized Nikon USA sellers and re-bought it."
Does the camera come with a battery and recharger?,Yes
Does this bundle come with a camera + lens case?,It did not come with any cases
"Does it have an ""audio in"" so that you can use an external mike?","The camera has audio in, and it is good. But, if you want a very good sound you could use a external mike. It could put on the camera."
Does the camera come with a neck strap?,"Yes it does. The package comes with the standard black neck strap with the yellow ""NIKON"" lettering that you have probably seen other people wearing."
How much memory is include in this sale?,16 mb
"I like this camera a lot, how does it do on macro photos? Should I be looking into buying a macro lens or does it take sufficient macros as is?","I bought, then returned this camera. Look at the D3300 - a newer and better model. I suggest you try out the kit lens for macro shots before you purchase a specific macro lens."
"does this model have a pop up flash, or just a hot shoe??????????","Yes it dose have a ""pop up"" flash."
Will this camera accept AA or other Alkaline batteries rather than the included Li-Ion battery? Its nice to have that capability when traveling.,"The battery pack is 7.4 volts, lithium ion. It's a rectangular cube with a special connection. The camera runs amazingly long periods without recharging the batteries. I simply purchased a second battery, but have never needed to immediately switch because a battery had run out."
Does it come with a warranty or is one offered?,I was offered an inexpensive warranty option at purchase. TV is a good deal. Shipping was fast.
Can the USB port play music as WELL as MOVIES?,"The USB port only plays music (I believe in mp3 format) and pictures (in jpg). Movies don't work, unfortunately."
"Is this tv capable of streaming netflix, pandora, etc through my wifi?","No, this is not a smart TV, I watch Netflix though my Play station, great image quality!"
How good is the picture quality,"I uploaded a photo I took last night, showing the picture quality. Click on ""view customer images""."
"How is the quality of the sound for movies and gaming in a small room? Unacceptable, Just Ok, or Good?",It's passable. I'll eventually upgrade it but it's okay for now.
does this work with apple tv,"Yes, it does."
Is it simple to connect a home theater speaker system to this tv?,The TV has an analog audio output; it required less than a minute to connect it to my stereo system.
I got an HD antenna with a coaxial cable connection -- is there any way to connect the antenna to this TV? I can't see a place to connect it.,"There is a connection area, look at the back of the Tv. There should be a area where all the connections go on the side, at the bottom of that is where you put the coax, its jutted out and hidden a bit but feel around. Hope this helps"
"Will I regret buying this as a second monitor for work? Is it going to cause eye strain to read text from spreadsheets, pdfs, etc? Anyone try it?","I bought this TV two weeks ago and like it but I do not do spreadsheets or pdfs on it. So far the picture is clear, there are enough pixels to make it a great second monitor or in my case, a second TV in my bedroom. Hope this helps. Margaret Davis"
Do you need a converter to watch broadcast?,no-just a good attenna
what is the range,"I would say 30-40 feet through a couple walls before the connection becomes unusably slow. This also depends on orientation of the router, as it tends to be better over horizontal distances when laying flat. On distances perpendicular to the plane of the router (i.e. vertical distances when laying flat) I would say the effective range is about halved."
"i have a high speed in wall connection, will this enable me to use my laptop without using a wire? i just bought an Acer touch face laptop and don't",Yes it will an n router gas a thousand foot radius just lay it down with the blue side up and you should be fine
Is this V1 or V2? There is a big difference. What is the FCC ID? Should look like PYnnnnnnn. PY309300116 is V1 and is PY311100156 V2.,Sounds like the seller doesn't answer questions or really care.
my wifi signal keeps changing between ON/OFF so I don't have a stable signal from my router. I bought this item on feb 2014. Is my warranty ok ?,No
"Anyone upgraded from this router? If so, what did you move to?","This was an upgrade for me from an earlier Netgear unit. I was advised that I needed a new router by satellite internet provider I was using. This provided good service, but I now have dropped the satellite company and have retired my WNDR3400 N600 unit. Sorry that I can't offer more help than this."
how may wireless devices can this router service?,"Several, I have 3 kindles, wii u, xbox360, a Sony bleuray player, 1 smart tv, a cell phone, and a laptop. This is a total of 9 devices. At times we have 5 or 6 online at the same time without any problems."

Does this router support Comcast Xfinity?,Yes

dd-wrt,"If by ""dd-wrt"" you mean ""Is this compatible with dd-wrt?"", I believe the answer is ""yes""."
There are four versions of the WNDR3700 . . . What version is this one?,I ordered mine two months ago and it came as a version 3 model.
is this compatible with comcast,"If you're asking whether you can take the output of the Comcast supplied cable modem and plug it into the input of this router, then the answer is yes. If you're asking can you connect this to the Comcast cable to act as a cable modem, then no."
"My single band wireless modem from AT&amp;T can't access much strength on the wireless channels it receives, is this the right type of router to help?","This not a modem this is an AP. But what you are intending would work if you connect this to your modem through a LAN cable and use the wireless SSID from netgear. I believe that you will still have to use your modem and are talking about the ""weak"" wireless connection through your modem. So in this case your modem is acting as modem + wireless router. Also check other high strength routers or may be amplifiers if you just want that. There should be a comparison for strengths of routers somewhere. I use this in my apt so cannot comment on the range."
block,?
Does anybody know if this comes with a battery charger? Do I need to buy one? How do you charge the battery?,mine came with one...
Is this product new and unopened ?? Does this seller give it with warranty ??,Yes a limited warranty certificate comes in the box.

"Will this work on any iPhone? If not, what versions are supported?",I have a 5 but I believe 4s or higher is what is required

Is it 32 or 64 bit processor?,"Hello, thank you for contact us, this system is 32bit 64bit capable."
wifi included?,"No, you have to buy the adapter separately. We have this bundle, and I would recommend considering buying the camera and the components that you want individually (and getting the wifi) rather than buying the bundle."
does this camera come with a rechargeable battery and charger?,Absolutely it does. I wouldn't have bought it otherwise.
Is a HD Video quality,"Yes, the video is HD quality. I am a relative novice to photography and it simple to use. There is a book and a CD that came with it that is simple to understand.

Do one of the lenses coming with the Nikon D3200 take very close-up photos. Will the camera/lens produce fine details of close photos?,Yes the pics come out with great detail.

Not sure if this helped, but told you what i know about the battery."
Does the camera and lenses come with USA warranty or are they grey market items,"Definitely USA. I had an issue with mine (I dropped it) and it went to a place in Long Island, NY. They repaired it quickly. Originally, they said it was free - under warranty, but once they figured out I had dropped it, they charged me ( a minimal and fair price)."
does this package include a lens cover and camera strap,"Yes, it does."
I'd like to know what type of battery this camera works with and if it's included. Thanks,"I recently purchased this camera kit. I rated it excellent in quality and function. The battery does come with it. I would recommend purchasing a second battery if you plan a lot of ""out-back"" photography. The battery life is aprox. 5 hours of use. That's more pictures than you memory card..:-) I do NOT recommend the Sony SDHC card included. Go out and purchase a couple of less expensive smaller cards and save them over to your computer often. My Sony SDHC failed on the second day. I've reformated it but don't trust it. The case included will not hold everything. You'll want a larger case to hold the camera and both lens'. I found an excellent Nikon case at Best Buy for around $70.00. I'm sure you can find one on Amazon for a better price... but it's hard to tell if everything will fit without seeing it. HAVE fun and capture those moments."

To use Google Play to download Android apps, you'll need to have a Google account with a Google email (either Gmail or a Google-hosted domain) associated with your phone or tablet. Follow these steps to add an existing Google account to your device or create a new Google account for use with Google Play: Turn on your device and tap the Google Play Store app. If you haven't added an email account to your device, you'll be prompted to ""Add a Google Account."" Follow the instructions on the device, which will walk you through either signing into an existing Google account or creating a new Google account. Once you have added your existing Google account or created a new account, you'll be able to use Google Play to download Android apps. Keep in mind that if you intend to purchase apps, you'll also need to make sure your Google account is set up for use with Google Wallet."
Anyone know how to install an external keyboard?,"Try a ""Blue Tooth"" device."
can you download photos from your camera into it,it has a sd card slot so anything you can put on that card should be able to make it to the camera though i've never tried.
Has anyone else exchanged their tablet through Machspeed? How long does this take? My tab was DOA so considering taking this back to the store.,"I have had to exchange twice and am about to again since the third unit has also failed. The turn around time has been about two weeks after I received the RMA number. DO NOT RETURN WITHOUT GETTING AN RMA NUMBER FIRST FROM THEM.

Which country was this product made in?,China

Can I use it for my Kindle?,Yes.
when charging my powerocks the light doesn't turn from blue to green why is that?,"The charge colors are as follows: Empty - LED off less than 30% charge - LED red 30-70% charge - LED green 71-100% charge - LED Blue So according to your question, the LED should never go from blue to green (if its charging). So if the LED is blue for a long period of time during charge, unplug the device from the charge cable and press the button. If the LED is blue, it is fully charged, but if the LED is green, then it has a charge between 31% and 70%. Hope this helps, and remember, you can always contact Powerocks directly and they will help troubleshoot issues with the Magicstick."
red or blue which color means fully charged,Blue means fully charged.
Is this compatible with iPhone 6?,"Sorry, I don't know"
Can I charge a droid 4 with this,Yes you can.
"does it come with a variety of connections for any cell phone, not just IPhones and smart phones?","It comes with one USB cord. That USB cord works to charge it and then by reversing direction, to charge other items. The connector works with any mini-USB connector--so most Android phones with the standard mini-USB connection. For other connection types, you need to bring your own USB connector. That includes iPhones."
Can this be used overseas? Don't understand how it is recharged...,don't know
Can Icharge a go pro camera battery?,To be honest maybe I use it for my iPad and iPhone
can i use for iphone 5?,"Yes it works well on mine. You will just need to use the iPhone 5 USB adapter, because it is the USB end that plugs into the Magicstick."
Do you charge the magicstick to an outlet? I do not want to charge with my computer,either way. If you have an external usb charger you can use. I use the charger from my iphone.
Does this charger work well with the kindle fire hd and for low long does the battery last?,"The charger work with the kindle fire HD but I don't think it will last long (maybe one charge) 2600mAh. I only use for my Iphone5, but you can use it with any device that have an usb cable."
Could someone please tell me how to use this. I charged my phone once with it and now it will not charge my phone again after I have charged the item,I'm not sure if this applies to your situation but when you push the white button on the end of the stick is it red or blue? If it is red the powerstick needs to be charged. Plug in the black cord into the micro usb slot and the usb end into either a usb wall connector and plug into an outlet. It takes about 3-5 hours for the powerstick to fully charge depending on how depleted it was to begin with. The white button will be red when you plug it in (after a few seconds) then stay red as it is charging. Once it turns blue it is fully charged and you can use it with your phone as needed.
This is not universal is it? My friend uses it for an iphone 4. It does not fit into an iphone 6. We tried to plug it into mine today.,It DOES fit the iphone 6! I use it every day.
How long is the warrantee period?,"Whatever it is, not long enough. Mine stopped working after 15 days and I sent it back for a refund. The connector is very fragile and I never break ANYTHING (very careful with my stuff). This is a problem with this unit - the connector seems to not be soldered well or mechanically sound."
Can you recharge this device in a 220 volts outlet over seas?,I am not sure. I have not used it outside the US
"Hi! Can I , using this device, connect my Samsung phone to my Amplifier thru Bluetooth and play stuff? Thanks again.","Hey there- If I were you I'd TOTALLY stay away from this product. Yamaha 2nd level tech support called me 8 days later and I explained to them that I didnt want to speak to them and how disappointed that a 2 year old $2000 receiver couldn't get support - they were the ones who told me to buy the YWA!!. The YWA-10BL isnt made for Bluetooth; youd be better off buying, like I did, a TP-LINK TL-WA801ND Wireless N300 Access Point, 2.4Ghz 300Mbps, 802.11b/g/n, AP/Client/Bridge/Repeater, 2x 4dBi, Passive POE for $21.79 and using an Ethernet cable to connect to your receiver allowing it to pick up your WIFI signal. Mine is working 100% now. Again - stay away from this Yamaha product! HMU with any other questions!"
"I bought the bluetooth adapter, &amp; assume I can play my iPad or PC through the receiver, + Pandora if I have it. What's different about this product?","This product allows you to connect to your wireless network with your Yanaha receiver. It can only be used on those receivers that are set up with an Ethernet plug for connecting to a wired network and the Internet. Usually the AirPlay works through the Bluetooth connection which is not part of this device. This will allow you to connect to Pandora and SiriusXM services through your network and the Internet. If you have the receiver close to your network router and can plug an Ethernet cable into the receiver, you do not need this. If you have the receiver no where near your router and you have wireless network, you would benefit from it."
Will a standard USB network adapter work?,Yes
Will this unit permit video streaming from the home network?,"I believe Yamaha A/V Receivers only supports audio network services (Pandora, net radio etc.). You can connect a separate box that streams video to the receiver but that box would already have an internet connection."
Will this work with an Airport Extreme router? Not sure if I have a defective unit or if they do not work together.,I sent back the unit I had. it worked with nothing.
I want to connect my Yamaha Motif XF to my computer wirelessly. I want to know if I can do it with this device or not?,"Your Motif XF would need a USB and and ethernet port. The ywa 10 will connect your Yamaha Motif to a wireless hub wirelessly if you have the USB and ethernet port. You will have to program the ywa 10 to communicate with the wireless hub. Any devices you can access from the wireless hub including a computer should communicate over IP protocol if your Motif has this capability. If you want your device to communicate DIRECTLY with your computer rather than through your wireless hub, you would need the bluetooth adapter. Your Motif XF would have to have the connectors for the bluetooth device, i.e. connector port and USB port on the Motif and the Motif would have to be bluetooth capable etc. The bluetooth device is the ywa 11 rather than the ywa 10. The ywa 11 requires a power port and a usb port, which would have to be on the Motif XF to connect it. You also have to see from the product literature if your Motif XF can communicate with a computer via bluetooth."
I bought a Yamaha RX-A1040 with WiFi already. But it sits in a cabinet and gets no signal. Would this help get a better WiFi signal?,"I purchased one of these and after 2 weeks of striving with it , I sent it back. I was at Costco and saw a wi-fi signal booster that you just plug into the wall which would help with this issue;Called ""amped signal booster""Item #629754 This brand 9Amped) is also available at Amazon and is the way I am going to go.I would avoid the YWA-10! Best regards."
I have a dvd player with wifi. Will this serve as my wifi connection for this unit?,Probably but the product is awful as stated so I couldn't recommend it anyway.
Is this the only wireless adapter that can work with the Yamaha V675 reciever or can I use any wireless adapter?,"I don't know, but this one that I bought dosn't worth a dime, no connection at all."
Does it work with the Yamaha Clavinova 609 for wireless iphone and iPad connection?,"I would NOT buy this item. Yamaha support is horrible - I was on the phone for over 3 hours and different people told me different things. I bought a TP-LINK TL-WA801ND Wireless N300 Access Point, 2.4Ghz 300Mbps, 802.11b/g/n, AP/Client/Bridge/Repeater, 2x 4dBi, Passive POE and am much happier! Take my advice - the YWA is JUNK!"
Can it convert Blu Ray player's HDMI output to SDI?,No. Blu Ray has HDCP copy protection.
Unit unstable. Locks up but drops the video every few seconds showing a black screen. Any ideas?,Please check all the connections and replace with a new power supply. If the problem remains please send it back. Thanks!
any experience coming out of gopro? I'm having a problem with one I bought.,this works well - I have a few of them.
"the box indicates it has a signal, but not seeing signal on hdsdi atomos input","Roger, shown is a avue which has a green light when hooked up. The atomos does also have lights and can send a signal pattern to your screen also."
"Do you know if it needs power supply? If so, can I use it with 220-240V in Sweden and Europe? Includes it any adapter to the power supplies?","Darya. This item comes with a standard 5V DC (110/120V) power supply. If you are using it in Europe, you just need a voltage converter from 120 to 240 and it should work fine. I don't believe it has an auto switch inside so you cannot just use a plug adapter. Hope that helps. Sam"
Can the SDI output be 1080i?,"Yes, that is what I us it at."
Will this work with the stem television studio?,"Atem television studio? You wouldn't need to. That's has all the input output You need. Use this if you want to run, for example, a DSLR camera with HDMI output to an SDI only HD pruduction monitor."
Will it convert 60 frames per second to 59.94 frames per second?,"I haven't tested this specifically, but I'd be very surprised if it did. This isn't a scan converter/scaler/etc; it's just a HDMI-SDI converter. Dave G, who has answered this question is mistaken; the BMD TVS accepts both 60fps and 59.94fps inputs on the same setting (for instance 1080i60 will accept 1080i59.94 inputs) without any conversion, so the behavior he is experiencing is not evidence that conversion is going on. (I own 3 BMD ATEM 1 M/Es.) If you need that sort of 59.94-&gt;60fps conversion (which you don't need if you are using a Blackmagic switcher, fwiw), I would recommend a BMD UpDownCross mini converter, Grass Valley G1, or Decimator UpDownCross converter. Or any sort of scaler (TV One, Atlona, BMD Teranex, Kramer, etc etc etc). If you also need the HDMI-&gt;SDI conversion Decimator is the way to go; their little MD-Cross box is a miracle. Simultaneous SDI-&gt;HDMI and HDMI-&gt;SDI, with scaling on all inputs. The little guy does everything you'd ever want."
"When I plug in HDMI, I get nothing coming out SDI. Does SDI status light when a signal is being sent, being received, or when SDI is connected??","when the sdi is connected you will see the green light on, if you don't have the sdi cable connected to the switch none."
Can someone post the vertical distance from the top wall-mounted screw hole to the center of the moving face plate? I want to center the mount.,"It is a little difficult to measure with the Tv on the mount already. If I measure the top of screw for the plate that sits on the wall and push the mount closed to get a measurement of where that moveable plate sits, it is roughly 2and 3/4 inches. If you need a different measurement, let me know."
"Will this Mount work well with a 60"" Panansonic P60ST50 Plasma TV?? I believe it to weigh 85 pounds.. I dont want something that sags.. Please help!","The 47"" Philips I bought this mount for weighs around 100 pounds - that's no problem. The mount is rated for 165. As long as you hit both studs on center and snug all four lags up I don't see how you could have an issue with sagging."
"Where are the wall mounting dimensions. As typical for overseas products, they seem to always lack the important details...",Bracket is 25.5 inches wide and the holes are spaced 6 1/2 inches from top to bottom. Should easily stud mount at least 2 screws.
which side is up on this mount?,"It doesn't really matter. Both sides are symmetrical except for the built-in bubble level. If you must have an answer, I installed mine with that on top."
"i have a 55"" 65 lbs Samsung ln55b640, i believe it to be a versa 400 x 400, will this work for it?","Yes, it will. And in an attempt to answer future questions like this about specific models - this mount seems very versatile to me and comes with a lot of extra mounting hardware which should make just about anything work out. There is a lot of steel in the construction of the mount so I would not worry about weight until you are up towards the 160-170 pound range."
"How wide is the part that mounts to the back of the tv? The holes in my TV are exactly 26"" apart","The front plate is approximately 31"" wide. This mount is compatible with the bolt hole width of 26""."
"Has anyone mounted this to metal studs? I got two toggle anchors with it, but they aren't mentioned in the instructions.","Same as with any tv mount. Buy 4 toggle bolts from Home Depot, locate the metal studs, drill through, and insert the toggle bolts and wall plate through the metal studs. Look on youtube for videos on how to do this."
Will this work with just a 100 x 100 VESA mount?,Why would you want this mount for such a small tv?
"With the arms all flat, what is the distance between the wall and the rear of the TV?","With the arms flat, there are 4.5 inches between the tv and the mount. It extends about out about 20 inches."
does it work with iphone5s? also does it have noise cancelling function?,"Thank you for enquiry. Throne Gold comes with 3.5mm audio jack that works with all iPhone and other audio device that provide music from an 3.5mm female jack. However, if you would need a inline volume control over your iPhone, you can choose Throne White Device or Throne Dark Angel which is ""Made for iPhone"". Throne do not have an Active Noise Cancelling function that requires battery. But it has a very good sealing that it provides a good passive noise canceling."
does it work with iphone5s? also does it have noise cancelling funtion?,"They are actually ""made"" to work with iphones, and these work perfectly."
Are they compatible with iPhone 4s?,Yes they indeed are!
ARE THEY FULLY COMPATIBLE WITH ANDROID PHONES,"Dear Yves-Fritz Samuel, Thanks for enquiry. Both Throne Gold and Throne Poison are full compatible with major Android Phone that use 3.5mm jack like Samsung, LG, Nokia..etc. Some particular brands or models having slightly different configuration, that our pack comes with a little adaptor that helps to do the conversion. Please note our another Throne Model (Dark Angel and White Devil) are only iPhone compatible. Happy Shopping and Happy Easter! I-Mego Customer Service Team"
When using these as a phone headset can you hear your own voice through the headset?,"no, they work just like a regular headset or phone."
Is this a noise cancelling headphone?,Oh yes...!
"Can someone please explain the difference between the Pentax 35mm DA L F2.4 AL lens, the Pentax DA 50mm f1.8 lens and the SMC Pentax FA 50mm f/1.4 besides the price? What does ""AL"", ""DA"" and ""FA"" stand for?","The major differences are the focal length (50mm and 35mm) and aperture (f2.4, 1.8 and 1.4). You may not be asking about focal length, but since there are two different focal lengths here: The focal length sets how ""wide angle"" or ""zoomed in"" you are. Bigger numbers are more ""zoomed"". You'll find it easier to frame a shot with 35mm than with a 50mm, especially in tight situations. These are considered standard all-around middle of the range, sizes with true wide angle at around 14mm and telephoto above 100mm. The focal length in these lenses doesn't factor much into their relative prices. What you probably really want to know. DA is a lens designed for modern digital SLRs with a smaller than full frame (35mm) sensor. Old film cameras are considered full frame. FA is designed to fill a full frame (35mm), which applies to film cameras or very expensive super-pro modern DSLRs. Unless you have one of these, you don't need the FA. AL stands for aspheric elements. This can add a bit to the price of the lens, but usually improves sharpness and other factors. Last bit of the puzzle are the apertures. Smaller numbers mean the lens can gather more light, making it possible to shoot in lower light situations (sometimes called a ""faster"" lens). There is a tradeoff though, shooting with a bigger aperture will shorten you depth of field, a desirable effect in some situations, but not always good for pointing and shooting. For instance, the 1.4 is a particularly big aperture. You would only be able to focus on items at a very specific distance at any given time, anything further or closer would be out of focus (look up ""Bokeh""), which, again, can make for a dramatic effect. 1.4 is typically limited to only the best, most expensive lenses for discerning photographers. Overkill for the rest of us. Anyway, in sum, I have both the 35mm 2.4 and 50mm 1.8. Both are great lenses and can be found for a bargain. Either one will produce better pictures that you get with the typical kit lens. I highly recommend you buy the cheapest one you can find and try shooting with it wide open (i.e. at f2.4 or 1.8). Be sure to turn off the flash. You'll see a certain professional pop in the pictures that is hard to describe."
I have never owned a SLR before.Please tell me what this lens would be used for vs the pentax DA 35mm f2.4 - would u rec 1 over the other or both? My main goals will be to shoot family photos (3 kids) and my kids sporting events (indoor and outdoor). -...,"I don't have the 35mm 2.4 but I do have the 35mm 2.8 macro which I like very much (though the price difference is considerable). The 50mm is an excellent lens and is one of the first ones I grab when I go shooting. I will say though neither the 50mm or 35mm are good for sporting events of any kind. You really can't get the distance shots with either so you might want to reconsider using them for those purposes. The 50mm and 35mm are good for family photos, street photography and candid portraits. I hope that helps."
What is the minimum distance at which this lens can focus?,45 cm (1.48 ft.) from pentaxforums.com
"Reviewers claim to use and like this lens on the K5 and/or K5iis, but Amazon says it will NOT work on the K5iis",Amazon made a mistake. Please find the answer on Pentax's website. http://www.us.ricoh-imaging.com/camera-lenses/smc_PENTAX_DA_50mm_F1.8#!product-specs http://www.us.ricoh-imaging.com/dslr/K-5_IIs#!product-specs KAF lenses are usable on K-5 IIs.
Is this lens compatible with a K-3?,Yep it is
looking for prime lens for pentax k50. amazon compabtiblity checks says this lens will not work. Anyone know if this is true?,"I own the lens it works perfectly on my pentax k30 and should work perfectly on the pentax k50. I am not sure what compatibility check would claim it does not work on the k50. The lens at f1.8 is fast, it is inexpensive, it is sharp and is a my favorite lens for portraits."
"Will this lens work with the K50? When I search for k50 lenses this is the first one that comes up but the little camera guide tool says ""no"" it won't","Yes, this lens will work with the K-50."
Does it work with Pentax K- 30 ?? or Do I need a adapter??,Yes it works
Can you compare this lens with Pentax 18-55 II?,"This lens and the Pentax 18-55 II are not really comparable. The 18-55 is a zoom, and the DA 50mm f1.8 is a prime, meaning, of course, no zoom. It's fixed at 50mm. Also, the 18-55 II will only open up to f3.5, so you really won't get the lovely narrow depth of field that you get with the 50mm f1.8, which is what makes this lens so attractive and seductive. So I guess it depends on what you want. The 18-55 would make a better walk-around utility lens. The 50mm f1.8 is a specialized, portrait lens that will give you a fantastically blurred background when shooting subjects up close. Personally, I think you should have both in your lens collection."
Does this lens come with lens caps?,Yes. Both front and back.
Will this fit the Shure SRH 440's?,"I'm not familiar with the design of the Shure SRH 440's headphone. If the headband on these Shure headphones are too wide this replacement upgrade probable will not fit. On the other hand, if the headband is narrow no more than an inch it may work. I used this replacement on my Sony MDR-V6 phones which are an inch wide & I had to really stretch this band on my headphones to get them to fit. Once I got the snaps shut it stayed in place. Hope this information helps you!!!"
Does it work with the Sony Pulse Elite? http://www.amazon.com/Pulse-Edition-W...,"Yes, I can confirm that this fits on my Pulse Elite. However, you will really need to muscle it on. Once it's on it fits well and looks pretty nice. It covers up the bare plastic headband with a nice leather one and greatly improves the comfort of the headset, but be aware that you will feel like you are breaking the headband as you are buttoning it up."
"Hi, fit into the creative aurvana live?",Hi. Jesus. Those headphones seem to have a narrow band as seen on the web. The replacement cushion fits on my headphones snuggly which was good. For the price I would go for it! If needed then some foam could be put under the cushion. The snaps should face away from your head.
Will it fit the BOSE Quietcomfort 15?,"I don't know why Dean does not think this works? I bought this replacement well over a few months ago and it's working perfectly. I wish we could post photos here, I'd show you!"
Would this fit Audeze lcd2?,"I believe these are High-End headphones. And, the covering of the headband is peeling/wearing out. I cannot say for certain. (Too note: I believe you can order and return if they do not fit.) I purchased them for SENNHEISER headphones. HD 280 and PXC 350. Models are about 8 years old now. Judge accordingly. Hope this helps."
How wide of a head band will this fit? I have the Sony MDR-V600 headphones.,I have one of these on my Sony MDR-V6oo headphones!!! This replacement headband will work on these headphones but you'll have to do some work at getting them on. I had to do some stretching of the headband snap by snap at getting this on because the original headband of the Sony is larger than this replacement. Your going to have to have some patients at getting this on. But once you get this on your phones it work well. Hope this answers your question!!!!
do they fit on the audiotechnica ath50s? need it because there is practically no cushioning on top. hurts using it.,Yes it fits. It's a bit difficult to get on though.
Will it work on akg q701,AKG headphones follow a particular headband design. I am not aware of the designated series (q701) being any different. AND! I would say NO! This replacement upgrade will not fit AKG's.
will this product fit Beats Studio Wireless headphones?,I do not know. The Beats Studio Wireless are a fairly new headphone product. (I purchased the bands for a 2008 purchase of a pair of SENNHEISER headphones.) The product info. page on Amazon should tell you the headphones that the pads are intended to fit.
Anyone using this with audio technica ATH-M40fs headphones? Thanks!,Don't waste your money
isn't it 1.9GHz? http://www.cpu-world.com/CPUs/Core_i7...,DB52 variant only ships with a 128GB SSD. The difference between the DB52 and DB51 is the fact that DB52 ships with a TPM - great for enterprise laptop users but really unnecessary for every day users. There is a chart out there that we can use for reference but it's hosted on another e-tailer website. Think of King Arthur's sword+PC...dot com. EDIT: DB52 also comes with Windows 7 Professional
"In the description it says 256 GB but when we click on more technical details, it says 128 GB... what is the right answer ?",256GB. You can verify this by looking up this model number on excaliberpc.com
why does amazon say that the ux31a xb52 will ship in 1 to 2 months? does this mean that it isn't out yet?,This model was released a few days ago and can be found for sale on excaliberpc.com and CDW.com I don't know why Amazon doesn't yet have it in stock. Being an Amazon Prime member I want to take advantage of 2-day shipping and not wait an undetermined 1-2 months before I get it. Gee you would think that Amazon is one of the largest (if not THE largest) retailers of this product so would have first crack at having them in stock. I'm baffled.
"Which does this model have? The technical details say that it has a 256 GB SSD, but the specs say it's 128. I ordered one based on the 256 GB spec.",I believe the model numbers after the UX31A-DB?? mean the following: first number is the Core i5/7 and the second is the SSD size 128/256. So DB52 means i5/256.
UX31a with i5 and 256GB SSD? Is there going to be any i5 with a 256GB SSD at all?,Look for the model number DH52 or XH52 or DB52. I don't know if there will be that model but the 5 and 2 signifiy an i5 processor and 256GB SSD. When looking for this model keep that in mind.
"I think there is an error, isn't this model is supposed to come with Windows 7 Professional?",http://zenbook.asus.com/zenbook/ According to Asus website it can be with: Genuine Windows 7 Home Basic 64 bit Genuine Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit Genuine Windows 7 Professional 64 bit However i found it really hard finding the previous Zenbook with professional
Is this model touchscreen?,no
Why does the tech specs say the hard drive spins at 7200rpm? Isnt this a ssd?,The drive is a SATA III SSD drive and as such has no moving parts to spin.
Does Asus UX31A-DB72 include Sandisk i100 SSD or Adata XM11 Sandforce based SSD ?,Its a lottery from ASUS...so like screen bleed intensity ( because almost all asus screen come with different bleed screen degree)
car / airplane charger: Is there a car / airplane charger that works with the UX31A ?,I have searched for one. I've confirmed that neither Targus nor Duracell have support for it yet.
Release Date?? Anyone have any idea when this might be available?,Nov-12
How did you determine the solid state drive spins at 7200 rpm?,solid state drives do not spin unless it is a hybrid drive. I do not think this model contains a hybrid drive.
TYPO?? Product Dimensions: 2.9 pounds Shipping Weight: 1 pounds,"They may not know the actual shipping weight yet, it probably defaults to 1 pound."
Where do I get the RAM? For this laptop is there a special kind or what.,"You're better to get an 8GB chip that runs at CL11 timing, as the laptop will reduce the frequency the RAM runs at otherwise to accommodate the faster timing, resulting in slower performance. Myself and many others have bough the 1600 MHz Cl11 8GB Patriot, and it works like a champ: http://www.amazon.com/Patriot-Memory-Signature-1600MHz-PSD38G16002S/dp/B007M538DW/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8"
When will this ultrabook be back in stock?,"It has been out of stock since July. There were some noticeable problems with these laptops (in design). Customer complaints about really bad backlight leaking, bent keyboards (in the middle), and the USB slots do not align with the outside shell. Hopefully ASUS tries to fix these issues for a second revision of this laptop. They are coming out with another line of ultrabooks with dedicated graphics minus the IPS screen (:-/). ASUS S Series (this month or next month will be the ""official release"")"
Is there any VGA capability?,There is a proprietary Asus mini VGA port on the side. The laptop comes with an adapter along with the USB Ethernet adapter.
Which 512 GB SSD would fit this laptop? Any help is highly appreciated.,go to Crucial.com put in model number it list all the upgrades ssd and ram
you have real photos?,those are real photos of my device
can it run linux?,"Probably. I've never found a PC that couldn't. No guarantee though. LINUX is a good way to bring old Hardware back to life. I was thinking of installing LINUX on this as a second OS parallel to Windows-7. When I do, I will let you know."
Doesn't this machine violate Apple's patent on thinness?,"Assuming this is a serious question, do you have a patent #? Given that thinness is generally a sought after quality of a laptop, it's unlikely that it, in itself, is defensible in court on many grounds. It would be like trying to patent a car that is fast."
"Should I buy this one now, or wait for the ASUS U500 (bigger, better graphics)?","I am/was split on this thought as well, but personally I feel the costs will be prohibitive of the U500. I presume it'll be around the $1500 mark for dedicated graphics and a 128SSD+500GB HDD (there will also be a 512GB SSD, which will easily make the laptop cost around $1700. The price of the laptop, albeit a subjective point, is for me not worth it considering the absolute POOR customer service reviews ASUS has gotten on here. It's very disappointing, and that's put me on the ultrabook search again after having my doubts about the UX32 :(."
"What i7 processor is included in the UX32VD-DB71? Intel makes an i7-3517U (1.9GHz) and i7-3517UE (1.7GHz), where i7-3517M/UM do not exist!",It is the i7-3517U(1.9 GHZ).
"After using for roughly around 2 and a half months, a popup windows says that I have to replace or repair the Hard Drive, what should I do? Thanks.","i think you sould contact asus , your HDD is certainly giving smart errors to the OS"
"What's the difference between the ""AB71"" in this product number and the same product number but with ""DB71""? Thanks!",The main difference is the size of the SSD -- AB71 is 128GB and DB71 is 256 GB
Is there a fix for the keyboard ribbon problem.,I bought a separate keyboard
"Is there anyway to upgrade the U100 Sandisk SSD firmware? The SanDisk Utility shows up as no available update, but the performance is *terrible*!","I do not know. This is not a work horse. Light web surfing eg. YouTube, Gplus, word possessing and maybe watching a movie on Plex, That's it."
touchpad,Acceptable. It's no Apple touchpad but it's on par with other Windows Ultrabooks and seems reasonable for the pricepoint.
Can you manually upgrade the RAM or is it how it is when it's bought?,"You cannot, the RAM and SDD are soldered onto the motherboard"
does this model have touchscreen,"No, it does not."
Has the keyboard had on-and-off problems. Sometimes a few keys just don't work?,"I have been using one of these all day, every day, and have never experienced this. The original zenbooks from 2011 had a lot of keyboard problems."
Does this have an SD card slot?,"yes, it does."
"Tien (Asus ""Customer Loyalty) - Why does Asus not remove this product until the MANY issues are resolved? Also, warranty support is POOR!!",I agree. I bought it in USA but I am from Argentina. I could use it five times only and then It has never started again. The warranty is only in USA.
isn't it 1.9GHz? http://www.cpu-world.com/CPUs/Core_i7...,"It does appear that according to multiple places (including intel - http://intel.ly/NkDugp), it is indeed a 1.9ghz processor."
Does anyone else have a problem with the screen brightness auto adjusting up and down for no reason when on battery?,"Windows 8. Issue resolved for Auto-Brightness a) Press Windows Key + X, click on Control Panel. b) Click on Power Options, Click on Change Plan settings under ""Preferred Plans"" c) Click on ""Change Advanced Power Settings"". d) Select the Balanced Active option from the dropdown menu. e) Expand Display, Click on Enable Adaptive Brightness. f) Put the settings as OFF. g) Press Apply and OK. h) Restart your computer."
Are there and versions with 3d generation prosessors and with screen resolution 1600x900?,"The zenbook x31a ships with the I7 Ivy Bridge processor (i.e. 3rd gen). Screen resolution is 1920x1080. This may mean text is a bit small for your liking (as it was for me) you can increase default font sizes in applications easy enough. For example I view pages in Chrome at 110% rather than 100%. Dont change the screen resolution (via the control panel). Keep the default and simply modify settings in individual applications. This will provide you with a clear display. Dumbing down the resolution makes things chunky. Regards, Patrick"
What's the available space on the HDD after Windows 7 &amp; ASUS Software?,Out of the box only 72.4GB of the 128GB SDD are free. (from a review on this product page)
Power jack pin got broke after 13 months no clue what to do,Need to know more. Did it break off? or is it lodged in the computer? Is the pin still usable but the wire is broke? Could you be a little more specific? Maybe even upload a pic? Depending on how badly damaged the pin is you might be able to either get a new one from the tech division of Asus (or perhaps repair/solder the old/damaged one.) Go to their home page and try sending them an email. Good luck.
Does anyone have a problem with their letter keys stop working......it is so bad now that I had to buy an external keyboard to get the thing to work?,"I face this problem every 6 months or so ( I've had this piece of crap for 2 years now). Fixing it is easy, follow the instructions here: http://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Unresponsive+Keyboard+Keys/11932"
"Some models have their RAM soldered on, but some of them have SO-DIMM RAM (upgradable), can someone please confirm the case for the DB51 model?","Unfortunately, I can't answer that specific question but I can tell you that this model is one of the most unreliable computers out there. I've had to send mine back for repairs 6 times in 15 months: 3 times for keyboard malfunction and 3 times for battery-failure/heat issues."
Does this product have microsoft office installed on it or a product key for microsoft office?,"No, it only has an unkeyed trial version. It badly needed a new touchpad driver, but otherwise it's a great laptop."
"Do you shipped to spain ? I'm interested, thanks.","No, I was in the US. They seem very reliable anyway!"
Are all units affected by the screen bleed?,"Seems that there is a huge problem with it, the screws holding the screen are too tight as I've read. There are guides on how you solve it,,, but its not your job as a customer to fix a product, and you risk losing your warranty."
Price fluctuations: Is it just me or has the price on this model fluctuated between 1099 and 1149 all day?,placed order for $1099 plus $30 expet ship versus total Amazon $1153 memory is solder to motherboard. ssd is not user upgradable. there is a sticker to void warranty. AMG
"does this computer have the black keys on the keyboard or the grey ones, also mine came with windows 8 and you say windows 7?",It has large black one. I ordered one that had windows 7 on it although it is slightly different than my older version of Windows 7. I got a monitor and separate keyboard and am very happy with it.
I need to buy extended warranty for this product in the US. Asus said I can only buy it from the seller and they don't sell it. Any idea?,Extended warranties are usually not worth their price. If something goes wrong with a computer it will usually happen pretty quickly. If something happens further down the road it is most times a software issue and that won't be covered. Good luck.
Im interested in the UX31A-DB51? does it have the sandisk or adata drive? i want to make sure i aget an adata drive?,Mine came with a Sandisk drive. Not sure if that is just the assembly I got or the same for all of them.
can you use a bluetooth mouse with it?,Of course.
Can the memory be upgraded from 4G to 8G?,No. The memory is fixed on the motherboard and is not something that you can upgrade. 4GB RAM is all that it has and will ever have.
Does it have a touch screen,No.
Is there a different model that offers more RAM? 4GB is a deal breaker for me.,Probably not. I remember that when I was looking for this laptop there were available only 4 GB RAM. I really dont remember a model with more than that...
What is the processor on this? The product info is confusing. On one sections it says its an i3-3217u but on another section it says its an i3 2367,"It's 1.4GHz Intel Core i3-2367M Dual-Core. Also, instead of Integrated Intel HD Graphics 4000 listed it's 3000. Last but not least, this is NOT a FULL HD display. Seller should really pay more attention to specs."
"what is the true weight? some data claims 2.46 Lbs, other are closer to 3.0 lbs? What gives?","Definitely 3.2lbs which is confirmed by the asus website. I believe the UX21 is 2.46lbs which is the 11.6"" premium model."
"Battery life. How long does the battery last? (No games, etc.) Just normal use -- email, composing, search.","I like to use the brightness at full and with the Wi-Fi on, if I browse, email, etc, I think it lasts me around 3-4 hours. The battery life isn't too impressive on this laptop.."
Is the memory expandable to 8gb?,"I think ""yes."" I believe this is the model I ordered back when (it's not here at the moment for me to check), but I upgraded the memory. As I recall, though, it comes with 2 Gig hardwired in, and then a 2 Gig expansion memory card. To put new memory in you have to remove the existing expansion card. To upgrade you can only order 4 Gig or 8 Gig, and so the total (with the hardwired 2 Gig) winds up being either 6 Gig or 10 Gig."
does this computer come with Microsoft office?,No - the computer stopped working 2 days after the warranty passed
Is this laptop good for hard core programming and Microsoft Office as well as serious internet browsing and research - if I get the i3 Model?,Get the i5
how is sound?,"sound is great, my only complaint is that the speakers don't go as loud as I'd like. All and all I'm super happy with my zenbook!"
Dos this come with microsoft office?,Yes it does come with a trial version after a certain amount of uses you are prompted to purchase a microsoft office package. If you are a student attending college you can purchase microsoft office for a lower price. Best wishes.
"does it have a free-volt equipped, in other words can this be used in 220v with adaptor?","Yes, it will work on an adaptor up to 240v."
is this a touchscreen,"No, it's not."
"Does anyone know if you can buy a universal remote for this system, so you can use just one remote to control everything? If so which remotes work?","I use my direct tv remote. To control mine, so I would think a universal remote would also work."
Does this come with all the HDMI cables that are needed to hook it up to my TV and DVD player?,No it does not come with an hdmi cable. Only the speaker cables and a rca type input but that is typical for most systems. You can purchase an hdmi cable on amazon for about 5-6 dollars.
Can you hook up a record player to it with rca cable?,"That shouldn't be a problem. Just jack into any of the line - in's, I remember there's at least one, it might say TV, VCR, DVD or something else, but I'm certain it will work as there is a jack or two in back and one for games in front that should work if all else fails. When you use your record player you just switch to 'games' the word GAMES will appear on the LCD in front but you'll hear whatever record you put on coming through the speakers."
"What is the dimension of the receiver only? Looking to see how ""thick"" it is.",I'd say 3.5-4 inches thick
Can you play music through a usb thumb drive?,No
how does it sound?,I enjoy it. It sounds very good for the price.
Does audio travel through the HDMI input through to the speakers? How well does it work? I want to use my Roku 3 with my projector.,"Yes it does...but beware- there is a delay of about 20-30 seconds, so you sit in silence as characters mouth words until the sound comes on."
Does the system support ARC hdmi functionality? (I.e. will it send audio from my tv to the system via hdmi?),Yes
Does this receiver accommodate ARC (audio return channel) on HDMI input cable?,No
does this have a hook up for Digital Optical Audio,"Yes, it has 1 digital optical input."
battery size and number??,"Six size ""C"" batteries"
can i hear the naxa cd player with headphones?,Our Naxa CD player only played for 1 night before stopping completely! DO NOT BUY!!
can it use a cigarette plug adapter for power??,"Good Afternoon, No this item doesn't have a cigarette plug. Thank you."
this machine read all mp3 cd discs,"Good Afternoon, I would have to assume it does so since it says it reads MP3. Thank you."
Does it have an alarm clock feature?,No it does not
does it op erate on 12 volt does it operate on 12 volt,Yes it does but I would not recommend this product the one I purchased lasted about 2 months
I need to know if this sterieo has plugs to plug into the stereo or does it have the red and Black push in tabs to push a wire in?,It is a free standing system. It comes with its own speakers. It does not have plugs to plug into the stereo system. Its speakers have wired plugs to go into the system. What I bought stopped working in the middle of a song being played (in about 40 days' of my purchase). The unit did not work after that. I was very disappointed.
what is the depth,"9"" the CD didn't. Work"
Does this have RCA or Aux input in the back?,It has one in the front right by the tape paper
does it have a connection on back to connect a fm antenna,No it just has that old pull up antenna
What are the size of the speakers?,Speaker box is 9' x 5'(rectangular) and actual speaker output are (circle)a is 5'
Can I plug my USB external hard drive drive and play the mp3s from it?,"Yes you can,it has a USB input so you should be able to do just that. Good luck Liddy."
Does the cassette have auto reverse,"In play mode; auto stop, yes; auto reverse, no."
how to connect speakers,Jan. 17th...I don't have the portable anymore - it stopped working after less than a year and I threw it out but I remember the it was incredibly easy to connect the speakers...
"Dose this fit a galaxy tab 3. 7.0 , are the arms also adjustable . Thanks.","I would say yes, it fits my galaxy tab (10 inch) AND my galaxy mega phone (6.3 inch) just fine. I use it for both and its adjusts nicely"
Will this fit an Ipad Mini?,Absolutely. Fabulous item.
Is this adjustable for use on my kitchen counter?,"No, I think it's unlikely that this would work on a kitchen counter. I only spent about 5 min. With it in my car and I don't think it's going to work there either. A more standard case with several variable angles is likely a better bet for a kitchen counter. You'll likely be looking down at it most of the time."
Dose this fit apple ipad 2 ?,Yes it works great
will it work for a DVP-FX700,I honestly don't know
How fast dose it charge,"My daughter said that it works wonderful and it is like a kindle or black berry charger, it charges within ten minutes. If you have a dvd player and are watching it while you charge it be careful."
Are you sure this will work for my Sony portable dvd player DVP-FX930,Yes I ordered it and it worked for me
Are you sure this will work for my Sony portable dvd player DVP-fx750?,"Yes,it will work."
This lens is compatible with Olympus Pen camera E-PL1?,"Yes, it's compatible - I've been using the EPL1/14-42 II combo for a number of months now with positive results - it focuses accurately, quickly and quietly on the EPL-1 and takes nice photos. I've noted that a small number of posters have mentioned potential firmware issues and poor photographic performance with this camera/lens combo, but that hasn't been my experience - and the majority of user posts appear to reflect similar, positive results."
Why are you selling it so expensively - when it is going for the $90's range? Buying this lens on the camera is cheaper than this...,"This is a different lens than the kit lens that comes with the camera at a much lower price. Unfortunately, I don't know the answer as to what makes this lens worth 3 times as much."
What is the difference between your lens 14 - 42 II &amp; those labeled only 14 -42 (No II)?,"The ""14-42m II"" is the Movie-Still-Compatible (MSC) version. If there is not a ""II"", it is the earlier non-MSC version."
This lens is compatible with Panasonic Lumix camera GF3??,Yes it is
CAN this Lens be used on the SONY NEX 5 or 7 with of course only manual control and focus? Appreciate any answers. Thank you.,The focus ring controls a focus motor rather than using a direct mechanical system and has to be activated using the camera itself. I would think this lens cannot be used without being completely linked to the camera.
What bit rate does the MP3 encode to? Or is it custom?,I wish I knew but I can't get the mp3 feature to encode.
Can you hook up an iPod/iPhone to the USB port and play your music or is it just for flash drives?,"it would not connect to my Samsung, but I don't know if that's because it's Android rather than Apple, or the connection cable is not compatible - in the instruction manual it says ""Not all brands of USB flash drives are supported""; and I haven't tried recording back to flash drive, but other than that this is an amazing little unit, well worth the price!"
"Does the tone arm retract automatically at the end of a record, or if it does, can it be disabled?","Arm does not retract. There is an autostop switch which can be set to stop the turntable when he arm gets to the end. Once the arm gets to the end, you can raise it with the raise lever, but the arm itself does not retract."
the Jenson JTA 460 to power it does it plug into a wall socket ???,"If you are in the US it has a standard wall plug without the ground, so the plug has two prongs."
"Hi, I just want to know, Can i use this player just to listen music? like a older home player ? obviusly wiht more advantages","Yes you can. It has an AM/FM Radio. I haven't listened to the radio, but if it works as well as the player, it should be fine for casual listening"
can you hook up extra speakers?,"Yes. The built in speaker it comes with is ok, but mine sounds great with external speakers."
How do I hook this up with regular speakers using speaker wire,You would need a receiver to go directly from speakers to this turn table.
"I see it has a ""phono"" setting. How can this be hooked up to external speakers? Does it have to go through a receiver?","yes, rca jacks on back. but u need to watch this vid I made... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYX2WqDdcSg&feature=share&list=UUMcVhm07VGIcUJWqMF5-1Gg"
"When I play vinyl, the output volume is fine. But I have recorded a track onto a SD card and the volume is really low. Is there a way to adjust it?",That happened to me with the thumb drive. I cranked to volume up to right before its too loud for the speakers or earphones. Then it is fine on other mediums. Its still not like what you get from the overproduced music today but you hear the warmth natural sound of the record.
Mine has a very low sound. I can only hear it if I get my ear really close to the speaker on the side. What should I do?,"Buy a receiver and hook up external speakers to the receiver. Only way you will get a decent sound out of this unit. I have a similar problem and after much debate, I am planning to buy Sherwood RX-41 9 105WAat model to augument this stereo system. Good Luck."
Does the plan start after the year on the fire to give the added two to make three,the plan starts from the date you receive the device.
Hi... I just ordered a Kindle 8.9... Got a voucher for 30% off... Tried to order extended protection with the discount- it will not let me. Help?,"Was it a ""Free voucher for 30% off qualifying Kindle accessories""? If so, it states that: ""Voucher is only valid for items in the Kindle Accessories Store identified as ""Ships from and sold by Amazon.com"" or ""Ships from and sold by Amazon Digital Services"" and does not apply to products sold by other sellers. Voucher is not valid toward the purchase of extended warranties."" Hope that helps..... :o)"
if I buy a 8.9 HD kindle fire from Best Buy can I still buy the 2 Year extended warranty at amazon,Yes you can. Amazon goes thru a outside vendor for the insurance
Just got my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 yesterday how long do I have to decide if I want this coverage?,I am not for sure. But i got the coverage just in case. I think it might be 2 weeks to 1 month after purchase. I highly recommend it. I have never had to use any my protection plans yet but would not be without them on electronics.
Does this plan cover battery Kindle hd 8.9,"Yes. If anything should happen to your kindle and it is not fixable by their Cracker Jack tech support, they would replace the product within the warranty period. You cannot afford to be without your protection plan whether one or two years, things happen. Must run through tech support for any determinations."
"I bought a Kindle Fire 8.9, 32 bit, but forgot to include a warranty. It has not arrived yet. Can I still get one",We had a similar problem but already have our Kindle Fire 8.9 and were still able to add the 2-Year Protection Plan plus Accident Protection. I would assume you should be able to as well. The number to call for the provider (Servicenet) is 877-441-3836.
Protection Plan for Kindle HD: I emailed them twice asking they are charging me for this right away?,"From the first line of the Technical Details: ""With pre-order, your credit card will be charged for the protection plan at the time of purchase, but your coverage will not start until your Kindle is shipped"" Seems pretty clear to me."
does it cover theft,Yes
If the product insured is stolen will this protection cover it?,"I don't believe so Ann. According to my contract it covers mechanical or operational failure, not loss of the item."
"i just bought a refubished kindle fire 8.9 hd,now iam told i cant buy a extendable warranty,why , it comes with a 1year warranty like the new one does","The time has maxed out on the 8.9 hd's. They can't hold them for another 2-3 years in case yours' breaks. The same thing happened to me. Mine had to be replaced after 20 months, no more extended warranty."
Some reviewers have complained of the sound quality being mediocre. What are they comparing it to? An uber expensive $300 (or above) system? Be real.,When it comes to any piece of audio equipment. You get what you pay for. This thing works great if your sitting around a campfire and you want some music for 10 people max and they better not be loud people at that. But for the price and what I use it for Id suggest it but if you want good sound you have to fork out the money.
"I'm curious about the USB option. With MP3s on a thumb drive, do you just stick it in and push play and it works or is there more to it?","Yes - pretty much, you need to change the playing mode though. It works very well."
Is this the best product of its kind below the $100 mark? Is there another pennywise CD player out there that outperforms this one?,"honestly... I thought this was great at first but the CD player now refuses to play CDs after just a few months - all actual store bought, not even burned. USB function still works fine. btw, this unit is also surprisingly large."
Is there anyway to use adapter on USB port or anything where else on this model to use headphones?,Yes
Does it play VCDs,no
how many watts does this system have?,4 watts x 2 and 8 watts woofer output
does this model have random play capability while using the USB input.,"yep, shuffle mode. use it all the time!"
Does this recorder on MP3,"Does it record MP3 as it's playing? No. Great device though. With a 16 gig flash drive, you have a ton of music at your disposal and you don't have to worry about CD skipping or going bad. Great bass too."
does it have a headphone jack,No
do it play with battries too,Yes it does. Needs about 8 batteries. And it's a good deal for the price .
available in australia?,"Sorry, it states for U.S. customers only?"
Can I buy the protection plan on Amazon if I bought the Kindle Paperwhite at Staples?,"That's exactly what I did, so I would assume so!"
Is the protection plan worth it? Question is...with service this good is the added protection worth it?,"I've wondered the same thing. It's basically like paying $30 for the chance to replace the kindle one time if the owner were to crack the screen or something like that. I think Amazon is good at taking back things with electrical problems, so I don't think the protection plan would be needed for those types of situations. The one thing I don't like is that they can replace the kindle with a refurbished model if they want. I'm typically careful with my electronics and I'm buying the Amazon case for my Paperwhite, so I'm leaning more towards no on the protection plan right now. I still have almost a month to decide though since I just ordered my Paperwhite on the 3rd and it's not expected to arrive until Nov.5."
"What if my dog eats my Kindle? (Yes, it has already happened once.)",You're covered if you have the 2 year protection plan.
What exactly are the perils insured against with the protection plan?,"This is copied from the product page on amazon. I feel like they answer the question pretty well. Plan Features Coverage Against Accidents Accidental Damage covers any accidents that happen during normal use of the product. While most service plans cover basic mechanical malfunction only, this plan covers your Kindle Paperwhite for accidental mishaps such as drops, liquid spills, cracked screens and other human errors for up to 2 years.

Express Replacement Should your Kindle Paperwhite need to be replaced, we will ship a replacement unit to you along with a prepaid shipping label for you to send the defective unit back to us. No shipping fees apply. Battery Replacement One-time claim for battery malfunction in the second year of coverage. Customer Service Support Customer service support is available from 6 am to 10 pm (PST) - call (877) 441-3836.

In the second year of the Protection Plan coverage extends to cover electrical and mechanical failures, as well as a one-time claim for battery malfunction. Limitations and exclusions apply. Please refer to the actual plan terms and conditions for a complete description of the coverages."
Define US-based customers only please? I'm in the States right now and I will be buying a Kindle but I live in Germany and I travel a lot.,Don't know.
does it include water damage and broken screen?,There is a one time replacement that would cover either of those problems.
"I am a US customer, but will be in El Salvador for virtually the entire protection plan period. Does it cover damages incurred abroad?","Key to the answer is whether or not Amazon does business in El Salvador. If it does, suggest you buy the protection plan with your El Salvador address. I believe in buying these plans. You should be able to change your account address to your planned El Salvador location at the time of purchase."
Does it cover loss or theft? I left my last one in a taxi in Mexico...,"Yes it should! Contact Amazon about the situation through phone, email, or online chat under ""contact us"" or ""help"""
Can i cover a kindle bought somewhere else? I have a best buy gift card that I would like to use for a kindle paper white pruchase,"Hi, Carlos! The Kindle is an Amazon product. Local stores sell FOR Amazon. I also bought mine locally at Best Buy and registered with Amazon. I buy my Kindle content from Amazon. I did buy my 2-Year Protection Plan plus Accident Coverage from Amazon. I think it is a wise choice to protect your Kindle!"
instructions,"In the past, the two-year protection plan has been for a couple of Kindles. However, the current one has yet to be used; therefore, I cannot say it is good or bad?"
Is there a limit on how many times the Kindle 3G Paperwhite will be replaced with the extended 2 year coverage?,"I really don't know. I'm a mature adult and I'm fairly responsible. That said, I've never had any trouble with mine. I got my first Kindle in 2007 when they went on the market. Amazon has been extremely supportive. I also feel I need protection from ""Murphy's Law."""
what are the plan terms and conditions,Here is a (*.pdf) of the Terms & Conditions for the Protection Plan . . . . ( http://www.protection-plans.com/static/terms/extensiondvdtoys.pdf )
does this cover for dropping in water,yes?
"I received my kindle 2 1/2 weeks ago, can I still qualify for the extended warranty?","Gail, I am not sure. You will have to contact Amazon directly for that info. I am sorry that I cannot help you"
what is the coverage?,"The coverage is for two years protection additional to the one year manufacturer's warranty to repair your broken item. The additional coverage protects your item to be fixed if you break it in an accident, i.e. drop it, spill water on it."
I purchased a Kindle 3G and ship date is 12/21/12. I would like to purchase two year protection plan. The plan qualifictation says I am not eligible,You are not eligible for the 29.99 plan but you should be able to get the 39.99 plan
Does the warranty apply if you're not in the U.S.A.? I.e. if you buy the Kindle from Australia (and use it there)?,"As ""Arnie"" answered in my question(very similar to yours), I guess this might be helpful: ""There are limitations to the coverage. Clause 9 states: ""This Contract Does Not Cover:"" A. Any product located outside the continental United States, Alaska, and Hawaii."" So, I would have to say no, it would not be covered."""
"If I purchase my kindle in the US and then this coverage. If I happen to move, will the coverage work in another country as well?","Unfortunately, no. The agreement restricts coverage for locations with in the United States, Hawaii, and Alaska if I recall correctly."
"I got this warranty over 1 year ago. I'm getting a new kindle under the warranty. Is this new kindle covered under this warranty until it expires next year? At that point, or just before, do I buy a new warranty?","I just had to call to get a ""new"" one under warranty and just FYI...they are sending me a refurbished one...they do not send new ones. Not happy.I was told your extended warranty just carries over to this one and then time is up."
"Hi, does the back plate of this mount opens up like the one in the picture shown? The reason I ask is because the wall that I want to hang this on has an outlet on the same stud and around the same height where the mount should be installed. I'm...","It does, but its circular..and I don't think the opening is bigger than an outlet."
"The description mentions 16"" studs, but I saw one review that mentioned that it would work all the way up to 24"". Can anyone confirm this, please?","Yes you could put the screws in the last holes and that would be 24 inches. I have mine at 16 because that is where my studs were! Most houses the studs are 16 on center, I've not heard of any being 24 on center, what I would do is use two 2x6s and run them across the 24 in gap and go from there! The only thing with that is your TV would be 1 5/8 inches farther out than just the plain mount!"
"I got a 65"" Samsung, I understand it extends 20"", would that make it possible for me to swivel it 45 degrees? My TV is 59"" wide. (any math majors?)",Looks like it will work just fine based on the measurements I took of mine. To get a 45 degree angle one end will be 3 feet off the wall. Just something to keep in mind when planning your space.
"Does it work for a Panansonic 55"" TC P55UT50 Plasma? It's 500x300...","yes I would definitely recommend it, after I received this product I realized it was better than I expected it was easy to install and I've had nothing but compliments."
"Will it work on an LG Plasma 42 inch tv, model number 42PQ30?",yes! it'll work perfectly i have mine on a 40 inch lg plasma tv.
WILL IT WORK WITH A 400X400 PATTERN?,It will work for any pattern up to and including 600x400.
"Will this mount work with a Vizio 60"" tv, model E600i-B3?","Yes it will I have a sharp television mount on the wall and it's a 65"" ok so u can buy it u won't regret it"
how far from the center of the mount is the first holes for mounting and how long is the mounting plate?,"If you can find a good photo, you'll see the holes are punched along the top and bottom. The attaching plate is 25 1/2"" , you will be able to span and attach to two studs, 16"" apart... Actually, 16"" center of one stud to center of the next."
"Hello, Is this mount compatible with the 42"" Sharp Aquos LC-42D62U model?","Should be. The mounting brackets on the back of your TV are pretty standard now, and this mount is very universal. We've been very happy. It's the only mount that was stable enough for the weight of the TV to keep it in place."
does this mount work with a sony kdl 52v5100 LCD tv?,"The short answer is, yes. The wall mount is first secured to the wall. There are two arms/brackets that attach directly to the TV. The TV is then lifted and attaches and gets secured to the mount via the arms. Because they have to be able to attach to any number of different wall mountable TV's, the arms are very accommodating. In addition to the height at which the wall mount is secured, the arms will also provide some fine vertical adjustability if necessary. There is also a small amount of lateral adjustability possible. The wall mount kit includes hardware such as different screw sizes and lengths. Still, there is a possibility that the kit won't include the precise screw size/length that your TV requires. So, you might end up going to the hardware store to get the ones you need."
Do you know if this clamp is compatible with Giottos QR plates?,"The Desmond is a standard Arca Swiss compatible mount (and very high quality). Giottos makes several different QR plates in various sizes. If your Giottos QR says it is Arca Swiss compatible it will work fine. Hope this helps, -Bret"
"Hi, I have a QS-39 Plate from a Vanguard Ball head and would like to know if this would fit into the QS-39 plate. The QS 39 plate has a Standard 1/4""-20 Screw. Can I attach QS39 plate to the bottom of this clamp?","Should work. I did same thing with a Dolica tripod. Might have to get screw for center, other than that in theory it witks"
"will this thread onto a manfrotto 488 rc2, like the dac 01 does?",If it doesn't you can get a different thread insert for just a couple of bucks that what I ended up doing.
"Does it come with screw? If yes, 1/4 or 3/8?","No screw came with mine, just the reducer to allow you to use 1/4-20"
I have a AMD A8/ Radeon HD 8570D APU. Will this work as a crossfire pairing with my system?,Good question. Try calling them. 866.883.5411
Does this support 4K?,no 4k needs more vram than 2 gb this barely ran 1080 at 30 fps
"How well does the card operate using a HDTV as the monitor, using just a regular display seems pointless especially if your gaming?",I'm driving a 60 hd led flat screen with absolute ease. The only problem you will have is with amazon streaming videos will not recognize this as a hd device and will only stream standard def to it. I have emailed them several times as this thing in a computer is vastly more powerful than a roku for instance that they will stream hd to. It will however up convert anything you play through your computer. Hope this helps.
Does it work with K9N2 SLI Platinum?,"It has several PCI-E x16 ports, so I think it should work."
warrenty,It would have a manufacturer warranty of most likely a year. I am not positive of the length of the warranty. But it does have one. It is a great card.
Will this graphics card support ALL the Sims 3 PC games?,Yes it will
what is the resolutions of the video card will it play battlefield 4,"This is an all round good card for the money. You can play skyrim with minimal lag, but battlefield 4 deserves a better card like a 256 bit. One milisecond of lag makes all the difference in battlefield. This is for the occasional, not so hardcore gamer."
Can this Graphics card Crossfire with the XFX ATI Radeon HD6670 1 GB?,It should be two identical cards
is this low profile?,it is not a low profile.
this card can do a crossfire with amd apu a10 6800K processor?,"yes this grahpics card should support the 6670 gpu for dual graphics, if you look at the apu a10 6800K box it has a list of gpu's that supports dual graphics which is the 6670 and the 6570. i haven't used the apu's but i have used both gpu's and if you want to run dual graphics with multi-monitor you should get the that gigabyte 6670 2gb model but if you looking to run one monitor and want something cheaper you can try getting a 6570 and you should be ok. Lastly if you are looking to build a apu build by fast ddr3 1866mhz and up because apu's are work better with high frequency ram, just check the mother board you will be using to see what memory speeds it supports for ram"
Will this work with a Garmin Nuvi 200w?,"Yes, That's the one that I have. The original cord lasted about 6 years then finally died. I tired other knock offs but just wasted my money. This works great and should last another 6 years or so."
Will this work with a Garmin Nuvi 2797 LMT?,This power cord does the job as far as powering the device BUT no traffic data is received
Will this work with my Nuvi 350?,Yes I have a nuvi 350 and it works great - just like the original one
my car does not have a cigarette lighter conection but does have 12 voly and usb connectors. Does this device connect with 12 volt and usb to chargej,"Hi Malcolm, as far as I know this device does need a cigarette lighter connection. I believe that's the only way it will work. I hope this helps. :-)"
hi does this replace the FM traffic receiver with 12/24 volt power cable for a n&uuml;vi&reg; 465LMT 010-00786-01 and will I still get live traffic,No- I have found that I cannot get live traffic with this cable.
Will this work on Garmin Nuvi 255 GPS,Works perfectly fine. I've got the same model.
Does it work with a Garmin Nuvi 2455 LMT GPS,"This is Garmin brand name. It work with all Nuvi GPS using same type of plug. But it doesn't have traffic receiver build in. If you lost the original cable, it will cost much more to buy the same cable."
will it work with an old garmin 260?,Yep thats the cable for the 260. Have a 260 and 760. Different cables for each and this fits the 260 ;]
will this work with a Garmin nuvi 2460LMT ?,"The package doesn't list specific model numbers, but does list nuvi as one of the compatible models. I'm using it with my nuvi 2455LMT, so it would probably work for your device. You might check the Garmin website to be sure."
Hello - does this power cable work with Garmin nuvi serie 2505 ?,I'm not 100% certain - but it probably does. It does work with my wife's nuvi 2555.
I bought a 3M Mp225a Mobile Proyector and a KANEX Mini DisplyPort to VGA CABLE it didn't fit the proyector. Can you confirm if this will?,NO it will not fit
"According to 3M Manual, pn 78-6972-0062-0 should connect to a notebook. Does anybody knows where I can buy it?","The manufacturer of this item is ""Cable To Go"". It's a 3-meter (3M) cable. You maybe looking at different item."
does it fit model MP225a? Who can help?,not working!!
Does it fit the MP180?,not to my knowledge. i can't find anything to fit an MP220 or earlier
Does this work with the 3M MP220? Thank you,No. The cable is not compatible with the MP220. I returned it when it didn't work and I'm still trying ot find a cable that works with the MP220.
"I need a cable to teach from my laptop, where can I get the right cable",If its fir 3m then that's the right cable but make sure it's for the correct model of projector cause its an unusual male end to VGA
Does this work with the Mp255a projector?,no
Can you confirm (others asked below too) if this will plug into the 3M proprietary connection on the back of a MP225 or MP220? Looks like a funky HDMI,It does not fit the MP220. Very disappointing!
The picture shows a silver color while the description says black. What color is the battery? thanks.,BLACK

is this a Sony product?,No it is not.... As a matter of fact it does not work.
Will it work on windows 8? Thanks,"Hi Luciana, I think it would work with win 8. I have vista and workes fine. I believe it comes with instructions on how to ""trick"" windows if yo get an error message like ""battery no found""."
"good afternoon, I have a sony laptop battery model VGP-BPS9/B the charger is not working, what is the best replacement charger for my computer",I believe your battery is good and you were asking about the AC Adaptor. In that case please specify your Laptop model and/or the model number of your AC adaptor. Thanks.

I contacted Magellan customer service for assistance, WORTHLESS; did not help in any way. Given the $ 200+ dollars i paid or it I kept using. Two months latter it stopped turning on all together. JUNK. Thankfully, Amazon came to the rescue. DO NOT spend your money buying this JUNK"

Is the covered under warranty?","Alberto, There can be several Issues causing the Mac Backlight not work. I would check with the Seller that you bought the Laptop from. He does not offer a Repair or Replacement, I would recommend Returning the Mac since it is not working properly. You have a right as a Buyer to Return the Defective Merchandise.

Is this macbook going to be fit to update to Yosemite?,No
"this seller in the tech specs says first release date 2012, but one of your answers says 2007-2008. which is it?",I believe it's 2007-2008. The model I have is definitely not from 2012 at all.

Some people have said they have contacted the company directly and received a mouse and video-out cable. Comes with basic snow-leopard software. No Microsoft Office or additional add-on's included. At least not in general anyway, and I think these machines are all installed with a standard image so they should all be identical. The machine I received was fully upgraded - 3GB RAM and 500GB HD. This machine is lion capable - it can be purchased through apple for $20."
CAn this be used with Serato software and DJ use?,"It would depend on what version of Serato you are running. Please refer to the link to see the version that this system can run. Bear in mind that this system is not upgradable to OSX LION or higher. It is as upgraded as it can be OS wise. I enjoy using it, but it can be difficult to find software as this system is a bit dated. The production date for this model is 2007-2008. Very good system for the money, though. I hope this helps! http://serato.com/downloads/scratchlive"
Does the keyboard and trackpad working properly ?,It all works good on mine.
does it have an HDMI output?,I bought this for my grandson and he doesn't live with me. I would suggest you Google the Laptop and see if they have details about HDMI. Have been really happy with this laptop (he says) and especially liked being able to purchase with Windows 7.

does it come with an adapter/charger?,"yes, mine did"
windows 7 or 8 ?,7

Do you ship to Croatia? :),Hello Yes We do Thank you
Does this have a DVD player?,No it does not.
I am thinking in buying it new from firemall llc. would this include the international warranty?,"I was asked to answer this question because I reviewed the laptop. I have no idea about the international warranty. Sorry. I suggest you contact the vendor. If they want to sell it to you, they will have a prompt answer. If they don't, they won't."
"Hi, I saw it has a one year limited hardware warranty. Does this apply worldwide, example to Panama?","I believe so. Had I known the troubles it would cause me, I wouldn't have bought it. I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone."

ubuntu,"a Debian-based Linux operating system, with Unity as its default desktop environment. Do not know if will run on your Toshiba."
Could this be 32-bit?,"Sorry. I dont really understand yr question. I have a problem eith the touch pad. I doest work after 3 months. Features Intel Core_i5_3317U Processor 1.7GHz 6 GB SO-DIMM RAM 500GB 5400rpm Hard Drive, 32 GB Solid-State Drive 14.4-Inch Screen Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit"
Would this be a suitable laptop for a high school student? would its irregular size be hard to manage?,"I don't think so - it is wierd to look at; at first, but I honestly love the wide screen for spreadsheets and websites. It is very light - as light as many 13"" laptops. Remember, to get a DVD installed on this laptop, you'll need to have an external USB-attached drive. Also, if you need to attach an external montior to this, look at the HDMI-VGA or HDMI-DVI-(I) converters. They'll be about $20-30 here, and don't cheap out on either. Middle of the road almost always works out well there for me. One caveat on this laptop - the keyboard is a little 'squishy' - so I do type on it quite a bit, but do NOT like it. If I had my preference, I'd have a Thinkpad T- or X- series keyboard on this laptop. Aside from that, it's an excellent laptop. Excellent screen size for spreadsheets and multiple html/web pages, programming IDEs."
Is it possible to add a dedicated graphics card?,"No, the graphics card is integrated, i.e part of the motherboard, but you can always get an external video processor that can connect through USB port if you want to make machines with integrated graphics a game machine!"
Is the processor type listed in the Product Details section incorrect (1.9 GHz Core i7-3610QM)?,"No, it may seem a little low(especially for a i7 core) , but this is an ultrabook. With turbo boost, its 2.9 (Max)."
Can you update the product description to state that the 256 hard drive is an SSD? You incorrectly state that it's a 7200RPM hard drive. Thanks.,Toshiba Website and trial product experience at Best Buy showed it is a SSD
I am a student who has to read most of the text on the laptop. Would the screen size and shape be adequate for this?,"Though this extra width screen is easy to show two page of word /excel at one time, I should say it's not quite suit for reading unless you're satisfying to scrol the page from time to time, however It's great for watching video."
Does the Toshiba Satellite U845W-S414 14.4-Inch Ultrabook have a DVD drive to play movie disks?,"No, it does not. It has 3 USB v3.0 ports, 1 ""HDMI"" port, headphone jack, microphone jack, and that's it."
I want to be able to watch movies on whatever I order...Would this work and if not can you point me in the direction of one that would,This MacBook will allow you to watch movies. So yes you will be able to stream movies online without a problem. Thanks Discount Mac Depot
"is the super 8x drive a slotdrive, and two, do slot drives use an actual ""disc"" like a tray drive?","Yes. If the slot drive ever fails, you can connect a usb external drive such as http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-External-Drive-SE-208DB-TSBS/dp/B009QBIZ60/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1389211947&sr=1-1&keywords=samsung+se-208db+tsbs"
I've never bought or used an apple laptop and want to know is this a good one to buy ?,"Just to let you know, this laptop has limitations. If you are the type of person who likes to stay up to date with the operating system, this laptop is not for you. If you are a basic MAC OS user, for documents, web surfing and you know basic stuff; then this laptop is good for you. I do not want to give you the wrong information nor impression but after Snow Leopard you will not be able to upadate the laptop to mountain lion +. Snow leopard, mountain lions are the OSs for Mac. If you need any detail help,contact me via skype. xxkolzinxx Thanks and good luck w/ your decision."
"will these fit on the ""323 Manfrotto Quick Release Plate with Special Adapter (200PL-14)"" by Ace Seller on Amazon?","Yes, it will fit."
Does anyone know if this will mate well with a Pentax K-5 and a Manfrotto #390? I see reports of the bolt bottoming out on a Nikon.,"Generally they seem almost identical (except for some marking on the bottom) to the QR plate that came with my Manfrotto 804CR2. The bolt protrudes roughly 6mm on both the stock version and this. (this is fine for my Sony A55). I'm not quite clear on which tripod/head you have. If you have a Manfrotto 390RC2, than I'm pretty sure it will fit, I _think_ the RC2 is referring to the plate system."
will this plate work with a Bogen 3265 head?,"I'm sorry but I don't know. I have a Manfrotto head. However, let me say that I have been using theses tripod plates for quite a while now and they have worked just fine. So if you find out they will work on your Bogen don't hesitate to buy them if. I should also add that the first set I bought were the wrong size for my tripod head. The screw on the back was slightly too big but I exchanged them and got the right size and now all is fine. Good luck."
Will These work with the following Joystick: Opteka TW-1 Tomahawk All-Metal Heavy-Duty Joystick,I suggest you look at the customer reviews for the joystick and see if it is compatible with the manfroto quick release plates. Some of them seem to think it will fit.
Would this plate fit the aftermarket QR ball head by Fancierstudio?,"I do not know, but if it receives a stock manfrotto qr2 it will work wonderfully. it is a good product."
Will this work with a Bogen Manfrotto head #329/3140?,"The only reference I can find to Manfrotto 329 is RC4, therefore I don't believe these will work. This is the same as an RC2 connect plate and works on the 498RC2 and 322RC2 heads for sure."
does this fit the 390 manfrotto head-I have nikon 3100,I use this adaptor with my Canon T3i & Nikon spotting scope. I have a standard tripod so I think it is what you are looking for.
Will this product work for the 3160 fluid head ?,"It looks like the 3160 takes the same plates. If it were me in your shoes, I'd buy it."
Will these fit MANFROTTO 190XPROB tripod?,"Yes, they will fit. The problem is that they are poorly made, I tried them and the piece to tied it to the tripod Fell off."
What is the size of these plates?,"Hi Ricardo, The size is as follows: on the black/padded side: 52mm X 36 mm. On the opposite side:52mm X about 41 mm. It is 10 mm at its deepest. I measured in mm because it is the easiest way for me to be precisely accurate."
"Is there a built-in ""Slicer"" or device that ""cuts"" audio? I have a MIDI controller and was wondering if I could take a sample of audio and ""slice"" it?","Yes, it pretty much has any and everything your going to need. Ive had it since christmas and im still finding new features i wasnt aware of, but to answer your question, yea you can sample music for beats"
Can you sell your music if you use the sound clips included (and don't edit them)?,They are samples you purchased so there shouldnt be a problem with selling your CREATIONS. The new added pieces you put with the samples would be considered a new creation.
Does it utilize USB conectivity and Windows ASIO Driver,"Yes, it can use ASIO, WAV or WAVRT. I use Mixcraft with a Lexicon Alpha USB Interface"
"Newby to this type of software--what additional equipment do I need to purchase to record instrumental? Mics, etc?","There are two main ways to connect your instruments to your PC to access the software; one is to buy an audio interface; this is a very basic setup in which you can plug a guitar or instrument into the interface which then sends the data via USB to your software; you also monitor output through the interface. The second way, this is how I do it, is to buy a small mixer which has what is referred to as a ""control room"" section; this allows you to hook instruments, mics etc to the mixer, feed them into the computer through the PC's line in jack, and monitor the output without creating a feedback loop; I like it best because you don't have to worry about that awful latency problem, the delay between playing and hearing what you played... with this setup you can hook up as many instruments as there are inputs on the mixer; if you play keyboards at all, consider buying a midi controller keyboard, these usually require only a single USB cable to send the signal in and power the keyboard itself, and Mixcraft6 recognized my old midi controller without my having to reinstall the drivers, which was excellent... hope this wasn't too wordy to understand; bottom line, I think buying a mixer is your best bet; you can use headphones or hook it up to a stereo system and listen through speakers."
"new to mixcraft 6 home studio recording...but when i speak or sing into my mic,my vocals are slurred and dragging...what do i need to adjust,pls help","Sometimes slow hard drive access times can cause stuttering in recording or playback. If increasing the buffer or latency settings in the sound device preferences (File Menu &gt; Preferences &gt; Sound Device) doesn't help, and you have Mixcraft 6 or higher, try this: 1) In Mixcraft, click on the File menu and select Preferences. 2) Choose the Recording preferences. 3) Try switching the Recording File Type setting from ""Uncompressed Wave File"" to ""Compressed Ogg Vorbis File."" 4) Now record something and see if the problem is gone. Good Luck!"
What would the Apple equivalent be?,"I heard logic pro was pretty good, i was initially trying to purchase it; but they don't make it for my computer. Mixcraft was recommended by a friend of mine."
does it work with windows 8,"It should. The box says it's compatible with Windows 7, Vista, and XP, but the website does say it's compatible with Windows 8. Hope you like it!"
"Do any of you use this with an external sound card? Is it necessary? My laptop has a worthless card, and it cannot be upgraded.",You can. I have a four channel mixer that I run my guitar to ( it's an Lexicon Lambda) it works great when I'm recording piano or guitar. I use a pair of Audio Technica headphones to listen to my mix plugged into my Lexicon. When I don't use my Lexicon I just run straight through my speakers when I'm mixing virtual instruments.
Is it fun?,"That's kind of a subjective question, but I think so. If it helps, my 9 year old daughter even uses the program to compose songs using the loop library. Check out the 14 day trial and see what you think."
All I need to do is copy and then fade songs to a CD. Dance recital stuff. Very basic...is this a good program for that simple level of recording.,"You can use Mixcraft for this purpose; you would need to first rip the CD tracks you want using a secondary application; Windows Media Player can rip individual tracks from a CD; create a folder in which to save them as WAV or MP3; then you can open a new project in Mixcraft... I find it easiest to open Windows Explorer, open the folder containing the files and drag each one into a track in the Mixcraft project where it becomes a CLIP... you can then move them around and order them as desired; eventually you will want to put all the clips in one track; if you drag a clip and overlap the clip in front of it, Mixcraft automatically creates a crossfade; drag the clip back and forth to determine how much crossfade you want... then you can use one of the Mixcraft CD burning engines to burn your mix to CD... hope this helps... remember, first you need to rip the selected tracks to your hard drive using Windows Media Player, to make them available to drag into your Mixcraft project..."
"Why the price of Noise Isolating type is expensive than Noise Canceling type, it seems the Canceling type has more tec.?",Maybe is because of supply and demand ? But from what I know the noise isolating version sounds better than the noise canceling version when the noise cancelling is not turn on
Just one question.. They are selling these (and a lot of them) refurbed on ebay for 99.00. Why are there soo many refurbed??,Not sure. But i'd stay away from them.
Are they Digital or Analog?,Digital
"What is the driver size, 40mm or 50mm? I have big ears and 40mm drivers would not cover them well and cause discomfort.",hhhmm.....i have small ears and and they just fit..
Why does this headphone need 2 AAA batteries?,The PASSIVE Noise Cancelling model does NOT require batteries. Only the ACTIVE Noise Cancelling needs batteries. The PASSIVE version has an audio plug on both sides.
are these comfortable if you wear glasses? do they hurt your ears from physical contact?,yes. It is comfortable even with my glasses on.
Are these gloss black like in the first picture or matte black? Thanks.,Matte black
How about the Sennheiser Momentum? Which ones are better? Inspiration vs Momentum?,I have not tried the Momentum but my complaints with the Inspiration were that the noise control was not good and I found the headset to feel pretty heavy after wearing for any length of time.
Just checking if these headphones are the model number 128917. Can you confirm this?,I do not know since they were exchanged for Sennheisers long ago. They certainly looked and felt good. Too bad about the audio.
How many noise does this block out? and what is the sound leakage like for this one?,This is the passive model which blocks out as much noise as the padding around the ear can muffle. This is not the Noise Canceling model. Noise canceling works by sensing and canceling out noise before it gets to your ear canal. It uses batteries for this.
How do you guys use this with IPcams which usually take 12V. This unit puts 48V through the cable... How/were is it regulated?,"802.3af and 802.3at PoE devices have internal voltage regulators. They may require 12v when using a DC power adapter. But, if they're powered using a PoE switch or mid-span PoE injector, they recieve a higher voltage (usually 48v) on the Category cable, then step the voltage down internally to whatever is needed. 802.3xx PoE technology allows each device manufacturer to design their equipment as they need, simply taking the ""bus"" voltage then dropping it using an internal voltage regulator. The supply side of the circuit sends a constant voltage, independent of the component or its needs."
Has anyone tested these units with gigabit? or are they limited to 10/100 operation?,"This device is the 10/100 version - since two pairs are used for data, and 2 pairs for power. There are Gigabit versions ""WS-GPOE"" that use transformers to share power and data - so all 4 pairs are active and gigabit rates are supported"
I have 8 hikvision 2032-l rated at 12v@1.25a max 7.5w they are PoE (802.3af). Which of these do I need?,"it will give you 60watts - 8 cameras x 7.5watts = 60watts.. should work - if its this camera - DS-2CD2032-I 3MP IR Bullet Network Camera - hikvision shows max 7watts with ir, so the WS-POE-8-48v60w should be good"
I have IP cams that support 802.3af standard. What else besides this package (48V 60watt power supply and 8-port injector) will I need? splitters?,"No splitters are necessary, all you need is an ethernet hub/switch."
Will this work with Dahua IPC-HFW4300S 3MP Eco-Savvy cameras?,It should work - the specs on the camera say PoE (802.3af) which is what the poe injector puts out. Works just fine on my hikvisions that use the 802.3af POE standard.
"Is this unit also a switch? I mean, I want to connect 4 POE cameras on one side, 2 computers and a cable to a FIOS router on the other side Is that OK?",This unit is not a switch. It adds power to the cable but you need to connect the LAN ports to a regular switch and the POE ports to the devices to be powered.
"Im guessing the Camera side gets plugged into the ""POE"" side and the switch gets plugged into the ""LAN"" side, correct?",You are correct!
Slightly different twist on the gigabit question - can this injector be used with a gig switch in order to support 100 meg POE end devices?,yes and no. If the attached PoE device is 10/100 - no problem. If the attached device is a gigabit device- link will not be established - if the switch managed - then force the ports to 10/100 - then it willl work.
What adapter do I need for Cisco 7841g?,the Cisco 7841G requires no adapter - it is 48v 4 watts per phone - so this injector is the right solution for 8 phones
"Is this Poe Inyector works with the following configuration : 100 mbps ip camara, 100 mbps poe inyector and a gigabit switch ?",Not sure I understand the question but I use this POE injector with gigabit switches all the time.
Is this for iPhone 4s,"Yes, Any iDevice that uses the 30-pin connector this is compatable with. Which means any device that isn't iPod or iPhone 5 will have the 30-pin connector. So, yes this product is compatible with the iPhone 4S. Hope I was of help!"
will this work with my daughters IPOD touch 4?,If it has the 30 pin (wide) connector. Yes
"I have gotten a charger that has the connector that's too wide for the ipod touch 4 (by just a bit, and figure it might be for a newer model? Will this adapt that connector to work with my iPod touch 4?","One question: you said you have a newer iPod 4...so your power cord is going to either the old 1"" 32-pin or the smaller lightning connector. This adapter ONLY works on the 1"" 32-pin iPod. I have an iPhone 4S with a fragile otterbox case and an iHome alarm clock that has a charging port on top. Whenever I need to charge my phone I had to take it out of the case. Now with this adapter, I just fold my opening back, slap the adapter in and connect to the iHome. It sits really loose so I push my iHome next to my lamp and the back of the iPhone sets securely against it. Perfect for me. Hope the adapter fits in a 1"" slot"
lifeproof,"Works great for the 4S, but does not work for gen 2 ipad"
My Bose speaker does not charge my iTouch when its connected to the speaker. Will this connector charge my iTouch?.,This is only a connector...if your speaker charges your iTouch then it should charge it
dose it work with the taktik extreme iPhone 4,Not real sure. I would think so though if it has the 30 pin connection.
Do you know if this will fit with my lifeproof case on?,"I don't know about your case, but it fit my Otter box case just fine."
Is this comparable with the lifeproof iPhone 4S case?,Not at all! I purchased three and basically threw them away rather than waste the time and money sending them back very disappointed
I am not seeing any comments on video. Does this allow for video?,"Yes, the couple times I got to use it before breaking I used it for netflix"
Can it be used to just watch blu ray movies?,It will not function as a stand alone blu-ray movie disc player. It has to be hooked up to a machine (aka your computer) that has blu-ray playback software.
will it work with window 8.1,DEFINITELY NOT - A PIECE OF JUNK THAT I SENT BACK!!!
I bought one and an enclosure states the package does not include software for bd movie playback. Where do I get it?,bought a program from dvd fab and is working right. try it.
Will this still work on a regular USB port (not 2 or 3)??,yes
"Hi, do you know what version of Bios it has? Thanks!",Stock/ Original to the motherboard. Never plugged into anything so its stock as is.
Will this mobo support an i3 2130 cpu,Yes it will.
Does this board have onboard audio?,"Yes, Audio: VIA VT2021 codec. High Definition Audio. 2/4/5.1/7.1-channel"
"will this support 1866MHZ? on the info it has up to 1600MHZ but then next to it, it showes 2400(OC)?",Yes I believe it should be able to support 1866MHZ
does this board support widows 64 bit?,"Yes, I have Windows 7 Professional 64-bit running on this board."
Just to be 100% sure. This card has integrated graphics right?,"Yes, Intel HD4000. It's much better than previous generations of integrated graphics, but still not up to pay with even most low end cards. Not an issue if you don't play many games."
My NEX 7 doesn't recognize a new Rokinon 8mm f/2.8 UMC Fish-Eye Lens for Sony E-mount. I've followed all instructions in the manual. Any ideas?,"Since this lens has no electronics, it's normal for the camera to not recognize its presence. You need to go into the the setup menu of the camera and enable ""Release w/o lens"". This will allow you to use your NEX-7 with fully manual lenses like this one"
Has anybody ever compared this lens with SEL16F28 + VCLECF1 combination (Sony's fisheye converter)? I wonder if this one is superior... Thanks!,"There's no comparison. The 16mm with converter is as good a substitute as you will find, but cannot hold a candle to the Rokinon. The latter is better corrected across the frame, better designed (Samyang patent), and very, very sharp. But the 16mm gives you the equivalent of a 24mm on a 35mm format - which may be a more useful combination for some shooters. I have a 16-50 PZ that covers 16mm acceptably."
I'm having trouble focusing with the lens - I've read online that the lens needs calibration when first opened. How do I calibrate the emount version?,"It sounds like you have a bad copy, i never had to calibrate mine and it is very sharp from pretty much wide open."
"can a filter be applied on the front? I am assuming the front is rounded given that it is a fish eye lens. and if so, what is the size?",no threads for filters - rounded lens comes out too far
Version II of this lens fixes Nex-7 purple fringing issue. A6000 has similar sensor size. Does A6000 work with this lens or should I get V2?,"I have the original version on a NEX-7. I haven't noticed any purple fringing (chromatic aberration), nor have I gone looking for it. So no comments on that aspect. That aside, to answer your direct question, both the NEX-7 and the A6000 have APS-C size sensors, and E (not FE) lens mounts, so there should be no question that either the original version or the updated version will attach physically, and will have a large enough image circle to fully cover the sensor on either camera."
"I've heard this lens is manual, Ive never owned a manual lens, is it hard to use?","Yes, it is a manual lens but its not hard to use at all. You have to manually set the focus (easy enough) but you can still use the cameras internal meter to control exposure. Also, read your cameras owners manual. There are some neat tools available to make using this lens a little easier."
Will this lens work on the Sony A5100? Thanks!,"The Sony A5100 is an e-mount camera with a APS-C sensor, so the Rokinon 8mm 2.8 lens with e-mount will work just make sure it's e-mount! Several sellers carry these and they are a real secret bargain. It will be cropped to 12mm on your camera just like mine and will capture not overly distorted, very pleasant images. Very versatile, compact, very well built lens, really sharp edge-to-edge with great colors. The distance calibration is totally off on my camera, before use it first check out on your lcd screen with a focus assistance where the infinity really is and mark it. On my Fuji at 4ft. The depth of field is so great, I just prefocus roughly between 2 and 3 feet inside and between 3 and 4 ft. outside, depends on the subject and get everything in focus at f8. I loooooove this amazing lil' piece of glass and I hope you will."
"Does this lens provide a true rectilinear image, that is, without the corners bending?",This is fisheye so the image cant be rectilinear....corners are significantly bent.
Will this lens work on my Sony a6000?? I need to know for sure! ... Thank you!,"The Rokinon 8mm with an E-Mount fits the SONY Nex Cameras. My understanding is that the a6000 does have the E-Mount and therefore the Rokinon 8mm Fish-eye should be compatible. Please note that the Rokinon is Manual Focus only; also camera has to be set to ""Release Shutter Without Lens"" in Set-up."
"Can the Rokinon 8mm Fisheye lens work with Sony A7? And it is for manual focus only, right?","Hello Chong Ho Yu, yes the Rokinon 8mm Fisheye lens will work on the A7 (and the A7R and A7S). However, the usefulness of the lens is somewhat limited on the A7 bodies because this lens was designed for a crop-sensor camera (smaller imaging circle) such as the A6000, A5000, or the older NEX-branded bodies. To use the lens on the A7 bodies (which have full frame sensors) you have two choices: use the lens in 'crop mode', which automatically crops the image in-camera (convenient) but only yields a 10 MP image on the A7, 15 MP on the A7R, or roughly 5 MP on the A7S; your other option is to use the full imaging circle (you can easily set this in-camera), but be aware that the resulting image will have a large black circular border (vignette). The lens is not ideally suited for the A7 bodies, since you're not leveraging the full frame imaging circle, but is still a useful (and reasonably priced) option. And, yes, it is manual focus only. Hope this helps."
Will this card power three monitors simultaneously?,YES
Will this card work in a dell optiplex 745 mini tower? I have one pcie 1.0 slot. If not what card would work that is dual dvi and fairly decent.,"Yes, this will run in the optiplex, however it will be limited to due to your PCIe slot only being 1.0, but it should work."
I have a hp media center 2005 pc with a 300w psu. Will this card work. I have a nvidia geforce 9500gt installed now. Which one is better?,"This one has double the clock speed and memory, so definitely this one."
Does this card work with Windows 8.1?,"Yes.... But beware, some win8 pcs will stop bootup if a new graphics card is installed in the pice slot. This is secure boot issue. If you have this issue then the nvidia website has installation notes to help deal with this."
What size power supply do I need to run this card?,"430 r more , & it will work fine."
I need to run 3 monitor each with a different image? Will it? Thanks,"Yes! I did it in Ubuntu for several months and it worked quite well. However, you'll most likely need a converter to convert from the Mini HDMI mort to a more common monitor plug type. I found a decent Rocketfish adapter which served me well."
Do you need to connect it directly to the power supply?,no. It's powered thru the PCIExpress slot on the mother board. Just pop it in and you are good to go.
"Does the fan/heatsink stick out? I have two tall capacitors right next to the slot. If it sticks out beyond single slot width, I can't use it.",IT WILL TAKE TO SPACES FOR THIS CARD IN YOUR PC.
Will this card work in Dell XPS 8700,"Your best bet is too go to the. Hp website and see what kind of pci xpress slot you have. I have a backward compatible pci x 2 or 3 motherboard, so it works excellent in mine."
ubuntu,IDK sorry
"will this work with a 300 watt psu? i have 1 hard drive, 55w tdp intel core i3 3240, 2 fans and an optical drive",You better upgrade your power supply at least to 400 watt. Check the power requirements of this card.
"Does anybody know if that card would be compatible with a Asus P5W DH Deluxe. Yes, I know it's an ""older"" MB from 2007 . Thanks",Yes. Any PCI-e x8 or x16 slot.
At idle does the card add noticeable additional noise to the system?,"None, only at 100% fans speed (force set by after market software). You won't hear it under your CPU cooler - be it air or water cooling."
Do the cards come with a DVI cable or does that have to be purchased separately?,Cables are usually shipped with monitors. It does include a DVI-I to VGA adapter
Is it working with three monitors?,I'm currently only using it with one. It will work with 3 but you'll need a mini HDMI to HDMI cable for one of the monitors. The other two use DMI. I didn't notice that when I purchased it but the cable isn't hard to get.
This video card is compatible with a ASUS M5A97 R2.0 Motherboard?,Yes. Any PCI-e x8 or x16 slot.

fan noise,"I have had this GPU in my built PC from the start, and I can honestly say that I have never heard a noise coming from this unit. The case fans are louder than the fan on the unit."
"does anybody know if Card compatible with PCI express my motherboard Intel DP55WB: my power supply 350 W going to be running 2 monitors,some gaming mostly photography editing. Thanks",I have mine connected by pci-e 2 however a 400+W PSU is suggested unless you want to under clock and under volt
Anyone know what is the minimum power supply is to run this card?,"Depending on how many HDD's, optical drives and cpu, a decent quality 350 watt should work fine. We've ran it in two different computers with a 500 watt antec and 550 watt antec with zero issues as far as power, a quad core and two HDD's in one pc. In fact, my system with a GTS250 only pulls 200-210 watts (total, system wide) while gaming and despite being an older video card, it does pulls a lot, so 350 should do the trick if that's all you have at the moment."

Does it work with 2007 Volkswagen Passat 2.0 Turbo? Does it have back up camera? Does it have AUX input? Does bluetooth work with iPhone 5/5s? Please help me because i'm seeking a NAV System in dash and DVD player for my younger brother's car.,"Back up camera input yes. Not sure what size din the VW has. But you'll likely need an adapter to mount it cleanly. Try searching for metro dual din install kit for that car. Aux, yes. But rarely gets used. Bluetooth and USB are superior in convenience. IPhone should be fine. Bluetooth is Bluetooth. I don't see why it wouldn't work The Bad..... This is not the unit that best fix your needs if you are looking for navigation. There is no GPS in this unit. You have to use your phone for GPS. I have a rooted Galaxy S5 and can mirror everything from my phone's screen on the xav... But it was NOT easy to get it modified to work. Modified firmware, rooted phone, etc. The cheap price is partially due to lack of navigation built in.... But as far as audio quality, there are few better deals for touch screen in dash units. I would call Crutchfield. They will recommend the perfect unit for your needs. Then search around for the best deal on whichever unit that is. Easiest way to get what you want for a good price on car audio/electronics. Take care -TMF"
How's the hands-free calling with iOS 7? Does it have a built-in mic or do you have to attach an extra microphone device?,It comes with a wired external mic. Mic placement is key. I've found the best place is on the instrument cluster as it's away from road noise and the recessed cluster catches your voice. You'll have to adjust mic gain for the best sound quality.
Do you need a converter for the Sirus/XM to work?,Yes. You need a converter or adapter for anything besides the basic car stereo functions to work. Great Unit thou. Can connect lots of difrent gadgets to it. Not to mention the software is upgradable.

I am considering the Sony XAV701HD unit and wanted to ask if anyone is using the Sony XA-NV300T Navigation Module (accessory) with it? Will it work?,I have a 701hd and have spoke to Sony about this. The xa-nv300t has not had an official release in the USA. The person I spoke with said according to the specifications on the 300t....it should work...

I have decided to wait for something more concrete from Sony before I drop 250 dollars to find out myself.

"Just wondering is it possible to install not just 8 fans in this case, but also a custom water cooling setup cooling every component inside?",Yes u can. This case has more options than the HAF 942 and 932. I own this case and a HAF both w. custom loops and the AZZA 9000B has more options for water cooling Rad placements.

Does in install in a pc. The picture doesn't show any holes in the side for mounting.,Yup.Standard mount in a PC chassis.
Does the drive come with a SATA power and data cable ?,it comes only with a red sata cable not power. Their should be one in your computer case.
"Once I have successfully burned my XGD3 backup, will it be safe to play online on Xbox Live?","I have had no problem playing any online, once verified. Make sure you check prior to attempting so you don't chance a ban. Also to note, Verbatim is your best bet for successful burns."
What molex power pin connection is used? I plan to use it on a Laptop.,"It uses the SATA type power connection, not the enchant Molex power connector. So be sure that your enclosure or external power adapter has a SATA poewr connector."
Does this Burner support XP Operating System?,I have not used this in an XP system but it should work fine as it's a basic optical disc. No special drivers needed. Just plug and play.
Will this write to both DVD=R and DVD-R discs? I need to copy some standard DVD discs not extended capacity 8 GB,"Simply put, Yes."

Is the ouput a DVI-D(dual link) ? Does it support 2560x1600 pixels ? are the outputs independent of each other ?,"If you had googled dual link dvi, the search wikipedia link would detail the technical specs for this interface."
Does this card output surround audio through HDMI? I have a 7.1 channel receiver that I would like to connect it to.,"Yes, this card does output surround audio through the HDMI I currently have mine connected to a Denon AVR-X2000 In-command 7.1-Channel 4K Ultra HD Networking Home Theater Receiver with AirPlay and it works great."
does this card work with my PCI Express x16 (Gen2.0) ??? I have HP Pavilion p7-1423w Desktop,"Shouldn't have a problem. I am running this card in a system with a Pentium D dual core. So I would think you should get way better results than me. I run mine as a media server to my TV. Works great, streams over the HDMI beautifully. I really like the card for what I use it for. The only issue is that you will need space large enough for it, no mini cases or anything like that, and it needs good air movement. In my HP system that required me to drill holes in the side so it could draw fresh air. Then again mine is ancient, so you probably have a more modern case with more than 1 fan. If you want this card for extreme gaming... Well you would probably have something more than an i5 system. It will probably do decent for light gaming, I just wouldn't expect too much out of it. Hope that helps."
can this card run two monitors ?,"Yep, that is what it is designed for..."
Will this fit in a dell 660s?,"yes the standard Dell 660s has 3 PCI-Express slots. You only need one for this graphics card. So unless you have a smaller version than the ""minitower"" version you will be fine. As for the actual dimensions you'd have to do the math but with 3 slots it's generally safe to assume one of them will fit the card nicely."
Does this card support OpenCL?,Yes it does
Will this work in an Dell studio 540 computer,"It should work just fine as long as you have an available PCI Express card in your PC. This is an amazing card for the price! I can play Crysis 2 with all settings on high with NO problems. Hope this helps! Cheers, optimusprimerib"
Does Sapphire Radeon HD6570 1GB support Windows XP operation system?,Yes. I am using it on Windows 7 however the box says Windows XP is supported as well.
Will this card work with windows 8?,"Yes, that's what I use it on."
will radeon 6570 fit dell xps 435mt?,"The included low profile bracket makes the graphic card able to fit into the XPS 435mt. However, the power supply might not be able to support the 6570 as that specific Dell machine comes with 300w psu andthe cards specifications recommend a 450w psu if I am not mistaken. That being said, the Dell machine I use this card in has a 235w psu and has not had any issues in games or otherwise. As they say, your mileage may vary."
If I were to go in and either remove the LEDs or clip the wires going to them inside(While unplugged) would it break anything else?,"It shouldn't. However just to make sure you do not break anything in the process its probably easier just to use white out, tape, or cheap nail polish to cover them if you do not like the light. You could even glue a piece of white plastic over it so it doesn't look cheap. Any of that will avoid the possibility of breaking anything."
What type of power plug does this have? Is it the flat kind or the normal stick-out kind? Is it straight or angled?,"The plug on this bad-boy is the straight type, it's not angled at all. Basically, this is a rebranded version of this power strip: http://www.amazon.com/Plugable-Protector-Charging-Samsung-Devices/dp/B00CHRID4Y I hope this helps!"

Also, make sure you reuse that piece of tape that's originally on it to secure the cable down. It's a good screen. Hope you're able to install it with no problems. :-)"
Does this adapter also work with MC lenses?,MC and MD lens mounts are identical. The MD lenses simply added an MD tab for exposure modes on newer Minolta bodies. Absence of this tab won't affect the adapter; it should work just fine.
"hi, will this work for a7? or will there be cropping and vignetting? thanx",Yes works fine for A7.
Will this fit on the Sony NEX 3N e mount as well?,I have the Sony NEX 3N and this adapter worked great!
Will this work on my Sony alpha a6000 usinG MF minolta/tamron lens,"Yes, the a6000 has the e-mount and the manual focus Minolta lenses are pretty much all MD mount."
Will this work on a Minolta Maxxum AF 70-210 onto a Sony NEX 3?,"No, this is for the older Minolta MD/MC mount not the Minolta Maxxum/Sony Alpha mount.

Will it work on my sony a 3000?,Yes
Will this adapter work with a Nikon 18-55 mm lens to go on an A6000?,If the nikon lens is md mount it will work
I did not get any instructions! How do you bind this thing?,"Its very simple to use. It has a limited memory so it can only hold enough info to remember 5 devices. When the device is on and you double click the button it will erase all its memory and previous pairings. To connect with a device is simple. When turning on the device hold for 3 seconds and the device button will start to blink with a blue light. Once this has happened continue to hold the button unfilled is starts flashing with both the blue and red light. Just to reconfirmed, through this whole entire procedure you are holding the button continuously for about 5 to 8 seconds."

Is it possible that this is both transmitter and receiver? One person says: This is a transmitter; Another person says: it is not a transmitter?,"No, it is not possible this is a transmitter at all. It is a receiver. I fell for the same comments when I selected to purchase this device. I received it and it didn't do either, so I contacted the seller about it not transmitting or receiving and the seller told me it's only a receiver and not a transmitter. Those claiming it's a transmitter are making comments about the wrong device or a similar device used to transmit and now only receives or they received the wrong device or they're simply wrong. This is not a transmitter. And, frankly, it's not that great of a receiver for the price. After receiving my replacement, I tried it out and then gave it away, because I found a better one for around $2.50."

"Will this speaker pick up the bluetooth signal from my pc that is approx 35ft away, with one sheetrock wall in between?","Lori, I haven't tried this before for I use the wireless speaker when I have my phone playing music. The only time I have had issues is when the speaker is in one place and my phone is in my pocket and I am moving all around my house. With that being said, I don't think you would have any issues with 35ft. Keep in mind if you have any type of wiring within the walls, that may cause some interference. Hope this helps!"
"Can you hook several devices to this at once? (Two iPhones, two computers, for instance.)","I have more than one item paired with it, but it only connects to one at a time."

"Will this speaker pickup the blue tooth signal up to 60ft away, through several walls? And can I get 2 of them and pair them for stereosound in seperate rooms?","No - 60 feet is too far, and Bluetooth will only connect to one speaker at a time."
Is this speaker wireless,"Yes. It connects to your device via BlueTooth. You have to plug it in to charge the battery, but after that it will run for several hours on the charge."
Will it work connecting a Galaxy tab 3 to a TV,"Im not sure since i have a Galaxy S3 phone and I usually use the adapter for external peripherals(mouse,keyboard,flash drive etc).I havent used it with a tv before but there should be a way whereby you can connect to the tv through your wifi connection.good luck!"

The otg connector is shown in two forms in the same ad - one straight and one right angled. which is it?,I got the right angle one. I don't think it really matters which one you would get unless you have a specific need. I would believe that you would get the right angle one.
Will this work with Dell Venue 8 Pro or other Windows 8 based tablets?,"it works for my asus Me400c, both Flash Disk and external hard drive(usb2.0), mouse as well."
Can I use this on my HTC Inspire also?,If it actually worked it could. Mine never worked. Spend a few more dollars and get a quality cable

"my router only has one ethernet port which hooks up to my computer tower, my blu ray system is in another room, will this product work for me?","You probably do not have a router if it only has one port, you may be talking about the modem. you should invest in a router which will add more ports to your modem first. this product does not add additional ports, it simply connects to 1 existing port. once it is connected and plugged into a power outlet, it converts it to a signal that will run through your home's power lines. this is where the second unit comes into play. when you plug in the second unit it will grab the signal and convert it again so that it will be usable with your Ethernet enabled device."

Is there an adapter for a TV that only has RGB instead of an ethernet port?,I'm not sure what kind of adapter you're looking for but you should take a look at this site for a large assortment of cables and devices that might have what you need. http://www.monoprice.com/
Can we use this in the country that has 220V ?,"The manufacturer says that it can be used with power input from 100V-240V, so, yes, you can! The reference to this is here: http://content.etilize.com/Manufacturer-Brochure/1022540950.pdf"
is it bivolt? 110v and 220v?,Actually the unit is 110/240 50/60hz So it should work in other countries except the plug on end is for USA 110 thereby you would need the adapter that makes our flat slots round. Check Actiontec website for sure.
i have a pair that no longer syncs together. anyone know of an easy way to re-sync or re-pair them to work?,"To restore factory defaults: With the device plugged into an electrical outlet you will need to press and hold the Security button on the bottom of the device for 15 seconds. To change the encryption key on a PWR500 Powerline Adapter: To reset and change the encryption key on the PWR500, follow the steps below: 1. Plug the Adapters into electrical outlets on the same circuit. 2. Press and hold the Security button on each unit one at a time for exactly 10 seconds. On the 10th second, let go of the button. When you release the button, the Power LED's will turn off very briefly and turn back on. The LK LED's will not turn back on at this time. 3. Then on one of the units, press and hold the Security button for exactly 3 seconds. On the 3rd second, release the button. When you release the button, the Power LED will begin to flash. 4. Now on the other unit, press and hold the Security button for exactly 3 seconds. On the 3rd second, release the button. When you release the button, the Power LED will turn off and back on breifly, and then the LK LED should be lit on both units. Provided the LK lights on both units are lit, the encryption key has been changed and the two Adapters are now connected on the same Powerline network with a new encryption key."
for this price do I get 2 boxes or does 2 units mean 1 box with 2 pieces? It is 1/2 the price elsewhere,It is 2 pieces in one box.
compatible with 200 mb,Yes. I have two 511 and two 200 MB. The 511s stopped working after 6 months of light use. The 200mb pair is only three months old. Actiontech is making me ship the non working pair back on my dime. I will not purchase actiontech again. Good luck.
After reading all the answers I still don't get the point.If there already is a Wi-Fi connection why duplicate it for other devices? Or are you saying that the 3G input to my phone is re-broadcasted as a wi-fi signal? What is the difference between...,"You put your 3G card in the Huawei and it transmits Wi-Fi to the Wi-Fi devices (computer, ipad, etc.) and you don't have to have a router and standard Wi-Fi connection...the device can be used anywhere you get a 3G signal...driving in your car and you get 3G signal, you can use your Wi-Fi on your computer for internet...I use mine in Costa Rica, all phones are unlocked...don't know how it would work with the chips that go into locked phones in the USA...should work..."
Is this an unlocked hotspot?,"Yes it is. All you have to put is a working SIM Card for your preferred network operator, and guess what, it works like a charm. The first time, you will be required to enter the profile of your operator. You only do it once. I bought 7 products some months ago for me and my friends, and it still works like new."
Do you need a computer to set this up once you insert a new SIM card? We live in the US and are traveling to Australia &amp; New Zealand and won't have a computer handy.,No you dont
"Hello, work in latinamerica?","Yes it should. I have used a bunch of sim cards from all over the world with it. You may have to do some profile configurations to get it working on some carriers, but I have only had to do that twice."
can I use this device in Libya for 3G wimax modem(I have user name &amp; password) ?,As long as you use sim from Libya it should work. I use it in afghanistan
"If I order today, will you ship it out so I can receive it in California before February 12, 2015? I will be travelling to China at that day. Thanks!","Hi Chris, Thank your for your interest. Normally the delivery takes 7-10 business days. So, yes, sure you will receive before February"
could be used in venezuela?,"Assuming you can buy a SIM card for Internet use only in Venezuela and the e5331 comes shipped to you unlocked, then yes. I would be specific with the provider you are talking to and ask if they have SIM cards for data use only."
does this work in india,Yes
I have an IPhone5 with and unlimited data plan. Can I take the sim card from my phone and install it into this device?,"Hi. Idk if is gonna work or not, I tested with the Tmobile 4G LTE broadband sim card the speed is slow on this device, I mean is very. ... very slow, on the monitor show only 2G speed, not 3G as advertised. I guess you can contact the seller, maybe they will give you the answer."
I'm taking with me to Italy. Am planning on buying a TIM data card. Is the set-up pretty self explanatory? Do I need anything else to set up?,Yes it is very self explanatory. Just put sim in slot under battery and hook up to computer/laptop it'll pop up go to set up new device.. That's it!!
"Will this cover ""breath?"" I'm concerned about moisture getting trapped and then damaging myTV.","Mine doesn't seem to trap any moisture. I don't live in a super humid area, but we have his lots of rain an the TV seems to be bone dry in its cover."
"will this cover work with a ceiling mount, pole type?",There is a slit in the back that would work for the pole from a ceiling mount.
"My TV is a 42"" but overall it's actually 50"", which cover will fit snugly on this TV?","I use this cover on a 50"" overall TV and it fits perfectly. My only wish is that the Velcro on the back side was more encompassing so as to fit tighter at the bottom when on."
Will this Cover allow me to use a traditional TV outside?,"I use a 42"" older LCD tv. I put it on a articulating mount under the soffit of my garage. It's been about 2 years and it's still working great! I use the tv all the time and I've yet to see a drop of moisture when I take the cover off"
Can this cover be ordered in black?,Currently it's only available in the grey color.
Has anyone used this with a flush mount bracket?,I have the swing arm but the cover comes all the way down the back of the television and secures around the arm with Velcro---small zippers at the bottom. I think this would need some adaptations on your part to work with a flush mount--it won't do it easily as is.
"My tv is 42.5 wide. Will the 42 fit. It says it is 42 wide, but is there a little extra for the .5 inch?",I really do believe it will.. there is room left over on my TV.. works great too.
"My TV measures 27 1/2 height not 26 1/2. Will the 42"" cover fit it?",Yes but you will have to cut off two of the flaps in back.
Does it close with a zipper at the bottom?,"There are two zippers on the bottom, left and right. But they do not close all the way across the bottom."

what temperature can this cover withstand without getting the TV damage? dallas texas heat could reach up to 106F &amp; winter could reach 18F.,I'm in Arizona and I've had no issues. It's a good cover.
will it fit over a tilt mount?,This cover has a zipper and velcro and is the best cover I ever bought or considered.I have it on my pontoon boat inside cabin on a tilting bracket.
What does the bottom of the cover look like? Will it product against dew?,"The bottom is not fully covered, it has an opening of approx. 15 inches"
"When you put a TV outdoors, how do you connect it to the source of the signal? Are cable/satellite boxes designed for outdoor use?",Bob: Check with your cable or sat box company. Generally not good for boxes (electronics below 40*F. TV's same way. I ran tie in to sat feed off one of the coax's. Check on google search for more answers.
what color is this cover?,light grey
"Does anyone know if this comes in a smaller version? We only have a 19"" flat screen that we're installing on our patio.","Currently this brand is only available in 32"" and 42""."
"The description of this cover says it is 33x23x4. Our 32"" TV measures 34"" wide, will this cover fit?","I would say yeah...I think it would fit a 37""....it is big ."
is this product compatible with finepix s4800,"yes I believe these are compatible products as with the S4200. The table top tripod is a joke, to small and relatively useless. The memory card and holder are useful for all cameras. Everything else is fine."
Is this product compatible with s4430,"I do not know; I do have the package, and supplemented it with a lot of SD cards, and it does take great photos-I am very happy with the product. the only complaint, and a minor one at that, is that there is no cable release socket. what is the s4430?"
Is this compatable with the Fuji Film s4300 ?,I really do not know-but the fujifim i have is a wonderful camera and I can do so much with it. it is the 114 megal pixal model s and zoom lens and it is great!

Is this tripod compatible with FinePix S2980 ?,Yes. It is absolutely compatible
what is the detail specs of charger and batteries? made in where?,"Are AA, and it can recharge. Its good"
Will work for a VIZIO S2920w soundbar?,I found that it was my TV and the specific location that I wanted (above the TV instead of below) that was a stretch. I bet this would work with just about any sound bar.
"Will this work with LG 3530A sound bar and Vizio 65""",It should. The holes in the brackets are spread out to fit universal. For the soundbar and to the Back of tv.
"will this bracket fit a 32"" samsung tv and a s2920w-co vizio sound bar?",I'm using that same soundbar on a Vizio tv with 400 x 400 wall mount layout. If the samsung has that same pattern it will definitely work
Does anyone know if this will work with a Sony HT-CT660 sound bar?,"You'll need to go to the hardware store to make this work. Most Sony speakers use the teardrop hangers, where yo drive a drywall or wood scre w into the wall and hang the speaker on the screwhead. It will work, but is not universal as the description states."
"My TV (Samsung UN60F8000 60"") is VESA compliant but my soundbar (VIZIO S5430W-C2 54"" 3.0) is not. Will this work to mount my soundbar to my TV? Thanks","I think it will. As you can see from the mounts, they offer a slot for adjustment. That is the best I can tell you. I have had mine for over 3 years and have never looked back."
"I know this says it will handle up to 33lbs., Does anyone think I would have trouble with a 25lb. soundbar?",No doubt it'll 25 lbs well. As long as the TV has a good stand this becomes an extension. This product is great and works well.
"Will this work with my Samsung 65"" TV and Sharp Sharp HT-SB602 Sound Bar?","The mounts are so universal, you can attached them to just about anything at any place on the stems. I'd say yes."
Does this come with the mounting screws or are they easy to locate?,There are several screws included but we ended up having to go to Lowes and get a metric size. The screws come in a blister pack.
will this work with a Panasonic sound bar?,I have a small Panasonic center channel speaker mounted to it. There are enough mounting holes to mount practically anything. The only mod I needed to make was to bend the bar slightly so the speaker speaker was level. This was due to a ridge at the bottom of the TV. The metal is thin enough to customize as needed.
Will this work with a bose cinemate sound bar?,"These brackets attach to the TV using the wall mount nutserts built into the TV. Its ""thin"" think heavy-duty washer. The image gives a good idea of orientation but the are able to be mounted as left or right versus being designated one or the other."
how far can you be from your wireless internet device with this tablet?,"We have mainly used the WolVol tablet within residential places. We have never had a challenge maintaining an Internet connection. When we initially received the tablet, I set it up at work. I was able to successfully use the tablet. The wireless device there is housed in a separate building. I hope this helps!"
i need help setting up the internet access to this tablet. where do i go. emailed them w/ an email message but havent' heard back from anyone,"I really had no problem getting into the internet with mine. It actually ""saw"" my router and after entering my router info into the tablet...it worked and still works...fine.

How to use the ethernet connection?,We use WiFi with ours
"my son cant remember the password to access his tablet, is there a factory reset?","We are having that exact problem. We contacted wolvol, but they wouldn't simply tell us whether there was a hard reset. Instead, they offered to repair it if we sent it back to them. Still not sure if that was a great idea, but we sent it (plus a$10 repair fee), now waiting to see how it turns out."
will it take a flash drive?,no
How many megapixels is the camera?,2 to the front and 3 to the back

"what kinds of differences from the Nabi make this cost half the price? Nabi has serious negative issues, how about WolVol?","WolVol-1.2ghz, singlecore. Nabi-1.3ghz, Quadcore Nvidia Tegra. Wolvol-800x400 resolution, Nabi-1024x600. WolVol-1gb ddr2 ram, Nabi 1gb ddr3 ram. WolVol-4gb Nand flash, expandable to 16gb, Nabi-16gb emmc flash expandable to 32gb. WolVol-2200 mAh battery, Nabi-3850 mAh Lithium-ion battery. WolVol-Wifi, Nabi-Wifi+Bluetooth 3.0. Is that enough reasons to cost twice as much?"
How can i download free games? because most of the games that i downloaded cannot be opened here in wolvol but its working in ematic tablet?,Go into the Google Play Store. All the apps you need are in there. Same as an Android cellphone. If you use up all your memory you have to get a 16 gigabyte micro SD card and insert it in the slot in the back of the tablet.
Can you download apps to watch TV shows on this tablet?,I haven't tried but i have put some movies on there for her and she does watch videos on the youtube app

Can I see Netflix?,Yes you can. You need to install the App from Play Store which comes installed on the device.
Can you use a denture cleaner solution in it?,Yes
Does it work well on retainers?,Yes! I often run my items thru a couple of times just for the fun of watching it. I also use it for my retainers.
Is this an effective silver cleaner?,I got this for Christmas and just tried it - none of my silver jewellery came clean. Neither did the diamond in my wedding ring. Very disappointed!
Is this safe for pearls and other delicate stones?,"It does not specify types of jewelry. It just says Necklaces, rings, earrings and bracelets. I personally have used it on some birth stone pieces."
Does this run buy batteries or does in plug in the wall? Thank-you,Plugs in
"If you have charged batteries in this thing, can the USB port power a dead cell phone (when it's not plugged into a car or the wall outlet)?",No it can't be used as a portable charger unfortunately
Does it charge NiCd as well?,yes
"From what I've read in the reviews, it seems this item does not have an auto off feature when the battery is fully charged causing over heating. True?",The batteries do get warm as you might expect when recharging quickly. Its fan does shut off after a while and it appears to do what it should I would buy another 1 or 2 no problem.
Does it work overseas (Europe)?,"You would need an adopter plug. They convert the currency to 220. You can get them at radio shack, wallmart or online."
"What does the button do? It turns on a yellow light, but what does it mean?","It is night light, i think as advertised. It can be turned on and off by pressing it."
What kinds of recharging batteries should go with Enercell 15 minute charger?,"It depends on the individual type of charger. Definitely they should be all RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES. The best way to know is to follow the instruction manual, or see on the back of the charger itself, mostly it is mentioned. Depending on the type of charger, most of them can recharge AA or AAA batteries of NiMH type. AGAIN, PL. CHECK. PER THEIR INSTRUCTIONS, WRONG BATTERIES USED CAN EXPLODE!"
Doesn't say whether it can be powered from a wall outlet. I see an automotive 12V plug only.,It can be powered from a wall outlet. The plug folds into the back of the charger.
will this work with a olympus me-15 mic,"It comes with the mic in the picture. I think there were options for a tie clip mic (purchase separately). I wish I could be more helpful. I found the headset to be lightweight, comfortable, and not too conspicuous when presenting. Try googling your question with your mic info and the name of this brand, for compatibility. That helps me. Good luck."
Does this work well with drive thrus as say... McDonald's?,"Well, I'm not sure I know how to answer this. Are you talking about being inside the McDonald's or being in your car? I use it in a classroom to be heard over students and it does that job very well. I'm not sure about the other. It is a good amplifier."
Is there an alternative to wearing this around one's waist?,It has a built in clip that can be clipped to any part of your clothing you choose.
Can this amplifier be used at the same time the battery is charging?,yes it can
Appreciate your opinion. Will this help to amplify Parkinson's patient voice and will he be able to wear it-confined to wheelchair?,"Though my husband who bought and uses this device to teach SS weekly is much easier to hear now, he does not have Parkinson's so my answer is guarded. It easily fits over the head and he's not complained about being uncomfortable with it. He only wears it an hour so no all-day comparison to help you with there. The amplifier is not unsightly either and it has made a world of difference when he fluctuates his voice in a large room. I trust that if you found it wouldn't work in your situation, that returning it for full refund should work fine. Amazon has always been more than fair with me there. Sorry I couldn't be more helpful. May God be with you if you are the caregiver or the patient."
Does this headset go into or on top of your ears. In other words can you use this device if you wear hearing aids?,"It doesn't go in your ears. It goes on your head like a headband, which holds the microphone up by your mouth. I don't like it squeezing my head, so I wear it around my neck and bend the microphone up towards my mouth. It is not like a Bluetooth if that answers your question. Unfortunately mine stopped working a few months after I bought it. I guess because it's rather cheap. But it worked great while it lasted."
Can just the headset be purchased as a replacement for a lost one?,"Never shopped for a replacement headset for this amplifier -- but was extremely pleased to find out that we had an existing small stand-type microphone about 4"" high that plugged in and worked great. My brother preferred it to the headset which can be uncomfortable. I'm not very ""techy"" but if you have any other kind of microphone that fits the plug-in, you might be right back in business without shopping and spending more money. Hope this helps."
"If I only use this from time to time in a class, can I just pick up the headset to use the microphone without actually wearing the headset","yes you can hold the headset and speak, without wearing on the head."
Will it work with a throat mike?,"Think when I asked they said ""No"" but not entirely sure."
Has anyone used this device outdoors? We guide tours at a monument for up to 80 people. Would you recommend this?,I have only used it indoors. It is excellent indoors!

Does it work windows 7,yes
Anyone know the exact model number of this? My laptop couldn't install it via plug &amp; play so I want to try a manual install..,should be on the bottom of the mouse.
Can you scroll sideways with this mouse?,"I'm not sure what you mean by being able to scroll sideways. You should be able to move in any direction with any mouse. All you have to do is move the mouse. If you're referring to the wheel, you can only use it to scroll up and down. I don't know of any mouse that has a sideways scroll-type wheel. I'm not sure this answers your question, but I hope it helps."
"Wondering how it does on car license plates at night, can you read the numbers?","You'll pretty much never be able to read license plates at night with a night vision camera due to the night vision LEDs reflecting off the plate and washing it out.

I hooked this camera up to my system and the video feed is scrolling the frame from the top to the bottom making the video feed unusable. Any ideas?,This camera has a button to adjust the setting on it. You will need to play with it to adjust. Sounds like you have it set on mirror which is reverse.

can a remote antenna with an N connector be used,"The antenna connections are the smaller type, I think they are called Reverse SMA or something like that but you can get adapter pigtail cables that will let you connect an N type connector to this router. Just make sure you keep your antenna cable as short as possible because there can be a lot of signal strength lost in the antenna cable itself."
Can i plugin in my 2 TB HD in the usb port of the N300 and share its contents over the network? some one please answer so i can buy it,"The manual I have states you can hook up a USB printer or speaker to the USB port. Does not state anything about a harddrive or flashdrive, sorry. They call it a ReadyShare Printer and music port. To use it, you must download the NETGEAR USB Control Center Utility from netgear's home page."

The movies I ripped, AVI files, mp4 files, mpeg files ?? and does it have 16:9 ratio","You can play the various video formats you mentioned on the Samsung Galaxy tablet by using any video converter by dragging and dropping your videos into the application, which automatically converts them into a size and resolution that's perfect for the Samsung tablet.

what all comes with tablet,I include a 2.0A wall adapter and USB cable with this tablet.
does it receive HD FM?,No
"Can this unit stream audio files directly from a NAS drive without a computer being on as well? My NAS is an Apple product, any problem with that?","Yes it streams from a NAS drive with no computer as long as the drive supports DLNA. I have had this about a year and it works fine. One note on your question, I run Windows so I can not speak for Apple. I would assume as long as the NAS supports DLNA it will work."
Does this have the iHeartRadio app?,Yes. Here is the link to the manual. https://gracedigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/UG-TUNER-PRO-IRDT200-IRTP800-UG-Feb-20141.pdf

I is a stand alone system, but has a remote that will let you control it completely. It can be down loaded play list by a account you setup on internet. It can play list of music on your pc's play list. I was looking for my manual but, no find yet ! If power is removed, the unit will not return last state, it go's to reset. I hope this helps you ! http://www.manualslib.com/ has the manuals"
Does it play OGG format audio files?,"Thank you for your question. Yes, it does. Media Depot"
Can this receiver be mounted in a 19 inch standard rack cabinet? Does it come with the rack mounting hardware?,No
Does it stream video?,Audio Only.
Is the control4 driver included?,No. The Driver for Control4 is produced by ExtraVegetables out of the UK and works extremely well. The driver and it's installation will need to be provided by a Control4 Dealer.
what the difference between this and the irdt200?,"Tuner Pro has firmware that will support integration with third party apps and systems - i.e. it can be controlled by and provide media metadata to other control systems. The non-pro line MAY have SOME current capability, but there is no commitment to continue the same level of third party integration in the non-pro line. Bottom line: If you have a Crestron, Control4, AMX, etc. automation system - get the Pro; if not - skip the pro."
Is Grace Digital still in business? Looking for support re: using an SD card in the tuner; can't anywhere with their website or their telephone.,Yes-search Grace Digital and call their CS department-I've found them to be very receptive.
Does it fit the camera with the lens attached? Or does the lens have to be removed in order for it to fit.,"The inside of the bag is adjustable and the camera will fit as is. However, the room is limited and difficult to get too many other things in the bag. I opted to use the nice Olympus CS-36FBC Leather Wrap Around Case for the OM-D E-M5 and carry the camera externally and use the olympus bag for lenses, power supply, etc."
What are the dimensions?,"4"" wide X 9.5"" long X 5.5"" tall. I use it for my PEN camera and accessories."
Olympus e-pm2 with two lens 14-42 and 40-150 ?,It is really much too large for that. The camera will be swimming around in the bottom of the bag.

Can I use my phone to control them?,You need to get a RF-to-WiFi hub like Hook (http://kck.st/1Ius6tS) to control them with your phone.
I have the same question. I want to buy a second one but am worried it will interfere with the first one I bought. Does each use a unique code?,"yes, each has it' own code. They work great."
What additional items do I need to use #2 and #3 on my remote? Love my #1 - works perfectly! I want to add another item.,You would need two more of the plug things.
Can I use the remote to turn on a light but then manual turn it off later and still be able to turn it on again from the remote?,"No. When you turn light off manually, you will need to turn back on manually. The remote unit cuts power off at plug & turns it back on, the light must be manually on for the remote to turn it on & off."
Can this be used outside in cold weather?,"I don't know. I use mine indoors. While the receiver might function at cold temperatures, I would not want it located where it could be exposed to rain. The Etekcity web site shows a tab for specifications but I was unable to pull up anything. There is a Canadian firm, whose identity I do not recall, which supplies industrial remotes with a very long range. The receivers are not plug-ins, but have to be hard-wired into a box appropriate to the location."
Is the 1Rx-1Tx programable? I want to buy two sets and set these up so that the single button push turns on two lamps.,I do not have that model. I have the one with controls for 2 lamps on each one. Mine are not programable.
"I just got one of these. Lights on the unit and remote work, but nothing happens when I press the on button.Am I missing something or did I get a dud?",what do you mean by the on button?
Is this UL Listed?,I believe so...
can this be plugged in to a power strip?,"I am not an electrician so I don't exactly know what the ""proper"" use is ----- but I do have one plugged into the outlet on the wall and one plugged into an extension type cord/powerstrip because the size of the unit prevented me from using both plugs on the wall outlet. Hope that helps!"
is it possible to change the orientation? it looks like the the antenna can rotate around the plug.,"No it does not, although the way it's put together suggests that it might. (Just to be sure, I tried rotating it.)"
Does the included heat sink/cooler already have thermal paste applied?,"Yes, it comes with all inclusive"
Does this support a 64-bit opperating system?,"Yes. I installed windows 7 pro 64bit on the computer that has this processor in it. Great processor. i do a lot of gaming and video editing, and while my system does have its bottlenecks, this processor isnt one of them."
Will this work on a Asrock H61m-vg3 motherboard? Thanks!,Yes it will.
Is this unlocked?,"No, Only the Models ending in K are unlocked."
Does this processor come with a fan and heatsink? I didn't see it on the description. Thanks!,"Its ""box"" yes, comes with everything"
Does it have integrated graphics,"It does (HD2500) and it handles normal video tasks just fine. However, if you want gaming capability, you will need a separate GPU."
What's the height of the CPU and stock cooler? I need it to fit in a VERY tight Antec Aria cube case. Thanks!!!,It stands about 2 1/4 inches above the motherboard.
does this support quad channel ram,I am sorry. I don't know.
This memory is compatible with this motherboard? GIGABYTE B75 D3H,Google your Gigabyte motherboard and see if it has an 1155 socket - that was easier than asking the question on Amazon
I need qty of 40 ea do you have the stock ?. Thank you,Thank you. Do have 100+ in stock ready to ship....Mega Micro Devices Inc.
Can the Oly OEM battery charge in the included charger,"Yes, this charger does a good job charging the Olympus battery too. This is the only charger I use now for the OM-D. I put the Olympus one away as it cannot charge these 3d party batteries."
Are these batteries fully decoded?,No. They won't charge with the charger that comes with the camera. You must use the one that comes with them.
Do the included batteries charge with the Olympus Om D em 5 Charger or only with this unit's included charger?,Only with the included charger.Don't know if they are decoded to show battery level.Will not charge olympus battery
How does it attach to a point and shoot?,There's a clip that screws into the bottom of your camera (assuming your camera has a tripod mount). You can unscrew the clip or use the quick release button to just detach the tripod itself.
do the little balls extend like can it get any taller than it is in the picture?,"No, it doesn't extend."
go pro,yes
How heavy a camera will this support? Looking for something for my 60d so that I can actually be in family shots for our vacation.,"It will NOT hold the 60D. Go with the SLR Zoom, it will hold the 60D nicely and with the Ballmount, it can be put in ANY position you can think of. Without the ballhead, you're very limited on the position and I PROMISE YOU, you'll be missing out if you do not get the ballhead. If you want something bigger than the SLR Zoom, the Focus is the biggest they have and I can't wait to get mine! (I have the original and slr zoom gorillapod) Go on YouTube and search ""wwjoshdew gorillapod"" and you'll see!!! I did a video of the 60D (with 18-135 kit lens) on the SLR Zoom and included some footage of it on the tripod."
Will this hold a canon reble 35mm ?,"No. I bought this for my SL1 which is the smallest and lightest of the Rebel line, and it would not support it. Kept falling over or the legs would spread out flat. Does not hold a DSLR with a lens."
"Does (how does) this work for an i-phone? I don't want something to have to stay attached to the phone, yet I want a fairly easy way to connect them.","It has a quick release button on tri pod, but you still have to screw it into camera mount."
Does this tripod have a screw for you to screw a gopro tripod mount onto it?,Yes
Will it hold a mirrorless camera?,"It will hold any camera with a mountable screw, depends what size tri pod you have and caera"
do you need the gopro tripod mount to use a gopro?,Yes you do!
Will this support a Canon Rebel t3i? Is there a special attachment that I need to purchase separately for attaching the camera to the tripod?,This joby comes with a small scale but very well built slide in head for quick on/off... I think your Canon model may be a bit large for this joby which is more for moderate weight... Try the next joby size up. Think you'll like that more.
What is the width of this tv? Can't tell height from width on product description.,"on stand it is 12 inches tall, without stand (for mounting purposes) it is 10 and a 1/4 inches tall, the width is 13 and 5/8, the screen is 6 1/2 X 11 1/2. I use it as a karaoke screen, its perfect"
Does the DVD player work well?,"The player does a good job; it's lightweight, small, and plays DVDs well."
Is the plug connection at the top on the right side or the left side?,It is on the left side of the TV.
Does this TV need an antenna?,"There is no built in antenna. There is a standard 75 ohm ""F"" type connector on the rear for signal input. This can come from a small indoor antenna, an outside mast mounted antenna, or from a connection to your local cable television company."
I can't seem to find what things come with the TV. Does it come with a regular power cord and 12 volt connector?,"Hi, Yes it comes with both. Regards Frank"
Are you able to turn the TV OFF using the remote or must it be done on the TV itself?,The remote turns the TV off. If you use a satellite receiver that remote will turn them both on and off
"If you stop playing a DVD but turn it back on later, does it continue playing or does it restart from the beginning?","Yes,it continue playing when you turn it back on later."
Any problem with view angle?,Yes there is a distortion if the angle is greater than 45 degrees. And the audio is very very poor.
does the tv unit have composite av inputes,yes it does but the sound quality of this unit sucks
Does the screen tilt/turn to various positions?,"yes, we have ours fixed so we can watch it from the kitchen, or turn it 180 degrees towards the breakfast room. You can also turn it up/down as needed. Tilts various positions........"
"Are the speakers hard wired to each other as I don't plan on placing them side by side. If so, how long is the cable? Thanks.","The wire is joined only at the end. Each speaker wire is approximately 3 feet long. Also, the speakers aren't labelled left or right."
is there a microphone input on this one?,No
is there a microphone input on this one?,Yes
"If I buy the whole thing, can I just use the speakers and give the DVD player away? I want to make sure the Speakers will work w/ my bluray player.","Yes you can. After buying mine I gave the DVD to a friend for is got damage and now I am using it as a speaker on my Computer, laptop and Cell phone."
Does this have rca style input/output jacks for adding other items such as a record player?,Only a USB connector is noted for an input. There is notation for audio/video cable and jacks but those are probably for TV outputs. So... probably not!

How many CD's does it hold?,one
does it play mpp3 cds?,yes
Does this have include headphone plug?,Yes

"is the full unit the 2 speakers on the side and center console in the middle? and if yes, are all three connected so it is easy to carry around?",All three are connected. But very light and portable! Love the system and as a hearing impaired person it works with beautiful clarity and sound. All three pieces come together in one package
Does this play only one CD or can you load more than one?,It only plays one it's a great cd player
Can us use the ipod touch 5 on this,No
does it play mp3 cd's?,yes device does play MP3.
Why do I need a mounting bracket if I have the one with my ps3 (my old hdd)? is this not a standard disk?,"I had to have a mounting bracket because I didn't have one to start with. If I installed the hard drive it would have fallen out, this bracket secures it with screws and it fit perfectly. Its not just a disc, it needs secured! I installed mine in less than 10 minutes for my son and I am a mom :). Very happy it worked so well!!"
Will this work for a CECH-4301A?,"I installed this hard drive in a CECH-4301A. At first I had a bit of an issue assuring it was properly inserted but as I soon as I did, the hard drive works fine. Funny thing though - I was never prompted to install a system update from my USB drive like I read about."
does it work for the PS3 Super Slim (12GB),Sure! It is working on my Ps3...
"As far as writing speed goes, is this faster or slower than the stock HDD?","a bit, but nothing major"
Does this work as a replacement in a PS3 FAT 12 GB?,Yes
I just purcahsed this for my PS3. Does it need to be formatted? It does not work when installed.,Yes it does
"I have an original 40GB PS3, wireless. Will this work with my PS3? Thanks.",Yes this will work all u have to do is a restore. If that doesn't work just save all data on usb drive. Then transfer data. That's what I had to do because I had 1 corrupt file so it wouldn't restore but saving on the usb worked
do I have to install PlayStation software or is it good to go after I swap it out ?,You do have to install ps3 software. All you have to do though is download it onto a flash drive from PlayStation website and then plug that into the ps3. It's easy
will this work on ps3 cech4201-a model,It should work on all PS3's. And is fairly easy to do so.
Will it work on any type of ps3? I just got the super slim 12GB version so I'm looking to upgrade.,"Yes. I just did the same thing. Works fine, but you need to get the housing unit, as otherwise it won't attach properly. They are about $6. They should be suggested by Amazon"
Compatible with a Samsung NP R480L? Thanks,Your Samsung NP R480L laptop came with a 500 GB SATA-150 hard drive in it so this drive is certainly compatible.
can i put this HD into my ps3 super slim 12gb to upgrade it? thanks,"If it uses standard 2.5"" laptop hard drives, yes."
will this drive work with a dell latitude d600?,yes
Will this work with lenovo thinkpad t420?,"Yes, it should if it has a SATA connection."

will this work with HP Elitebook 2530p Laptop?,Yes it will.
will this work in a compaq cq60-615dx?,Yes
Will this fit into an MSI GE60-2OE?,"Hi yes it can, now a days mostly all modern 2.5 inch drives are compatible with modern day laptops like the Msi GE60-2OE,The answer is yes it will fit."
Can this be connected to a Toshiba laptop using a USB cord or is it strictly for internal setup only?,"It is an internal hard drive. There are products that will allow you to connect a sata drive to a computer via usb, but you'd probably just be better off buying an external drive."
Will this work for a HP DV4 Pavilion Laptop? Thanks :),Yes
Can only Open Mesh devices join the mesh network. Say I have another wireless router or a repeater; can these be added on?,"Other devices, like a wireless router/bridge/repeater, can connect to the network just like any other client device can. They will not be members of the mesh itself though in terms of routing or control. They would just be acting as a typical client device. So, you could hook up another repeater, but it would not be managed as part of the mesh and you would need to have it set to a different SSID from the mesh's. Basically, it's a matter of whether or not the router has internal support for the batman-adv protocol layer (and, no, this isn't a joke -- B.A.T.M.A.N. is an acronym for ""Better Approach To Mobile Adhoc Networking""). If you really know what you are doing and your secondary routers support running the OpenWrt firmware, then you could possibly load batman-adv into the router and add it to an existing Mesh as a true node. That said, this is a lot of work and you REALLY need to know what you are doing -- and you will have to configure your router from the Linux shell interface. So, if you aren't up to using SSH and VI to edit the raw config files on your router, this probably isn't something to even think about."
"Has anyone used WiFi calling with this on a regular basis, going right off a (cable) modem? How does it do without QOS?","VOIP works fine on a 6mbps connection, provided there isn't more than 1 user watching netflix,etc. No one complains about poor quality if it is present; we are using it for this reason regularly. The Open-Mesh repeaters do seem to drop off the network for a minute or two at least once a day, no different than the occasional dropped cell phone call."
Does this unit plug into a router which then assigns the IP address or does this unit assign the IP address.,You can isolate the clients that are connected too the ap and the dhcp is from the router
what power adapter does this come with ?,"It came with a 12VDC, 1A US adapter when I bought mine."
What is the Voltage rating of the included power brick? 220v supported?,All of the OM2P's I've ordered on Amazon came with a 120-220VAC input and 12VDC output.
i want it but i am in india. how is it posible ?,It looks like it is possible to ship to India. Please view this link...
"Confused, I have a wireless modem router from my ISP. I would like to have more control an place an advert, do I need more equipment than this to add",No
can you use open mesh network with sonos,Yes. Just put them on SSID#2. See this FAQ from Cloudtrax - https://help.cloudtrax.com/hc/en-us/articles/202211040-My-printer-doesn-t-work-
Are these as fast with lots of users on them compared to connecting a few nice wireless routers to the modem via ethernet to serve users in apt units?,"Yes, if your ultimate goal is to ensure that all users are ""as fast as"" each other. Ultimately, the speed is limited by the maximum bandwidth your ISP provides. This modem has a feature for you to limit the maximum bandwidth that each user can use. This feature is very important and useful because no one single user can ""hog"" most bandwidth and cause other users to slow down dramatically."
How far does the signal reach?,It reaches for us about 250 feet with pine tress in between.
Will this work with HDR-XR200? The original battery is NP-FH60.,I Dont know but if it does get it
Im going crazy! can someone paste me a link for a charger that would charge this? Thanks,Watson Sony Battery charger for P F V series batteries. Available at quite a few on line retailers including Amazon. Link is to the Amazon listing. http://www.amazon.com/Watson-Compact-AC-Charger-Batteries/dp/B00EHST958/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1397447451&sr=1-1&keywords=Watson+Compact+AC%2FDC+Charger+for+P%2C+H+%26+V+Series+Batteries
Will this battery work with a HDR XR260 - It lists a XR260v but my camera is the XR260.,Yes but these are oversized and the fit is a little loose. To deaden any vibration I put a few layers of tape on the battery and now it is snug.
How do you charge this battery?,Just put it on the camera like the one that came with it and charge as usual.
will it work on the sony HDR CX220?,"I really have no idea the battery works well in my HDR-PJ260V. The battery supplied with the camera was a NP-FV50, If the HDR CX220 takes the same battery pack or compatible the 6Hr battery will work. A local photo shop should be able to help with compatibility. It does last a long time, but, it does add weight. Something to consider. It does charge the same and work just as well as the small one."
Does it fit the Sony HDR-CX430V? Is the voltage correct for this camera? Thanks,"I don't know. It is recommended For my HDR-PJ260V. Best add-on for the camera. We spent a MONTH in Alaska, taking tons of pictures, and I do mean a ton. The high capacity battery gave us plenty of power for the whole day. Alaska in the summer is a 24 Hour photo op it is always light. We always had power for that unexpected moment."
I charged the battery for two hours but it shows only 95% charged - there's one grey bar; but it does indicate that it has over 6 hours of charge.,"Mine does not have an indicator, I charge through the camera and a wall plug or through the computer. When it is fully charged the indicator on the camera turns off. My camera is a Sony similar to yours. I had to slide paper between the battery and camera body to stiffen the fit. The slight shaking of the battery really messes the camera performance. My battery did not look like the one in the ad. The camera worked a lot better with a larger battery."
I know you have the camcorders listed that this battery will work with but do you know if it would work with the sony HDRSR11,"What you will have is the same as my camera, that is the new battery will project an inch or so beyond the camera from where the original was tailored to fit. I gather that from looking at images of the Handycam. Because of the extra weight and not tight fit I found I had to slip some paper between the battery and the camera body to stop the battery from jiggling. With more juice my camera is more responsive. Hope this helped."
Has anyone successfully used this battery with a SONY HDR-CX 210 Handycam? Last after-market battery I purchased was rejected by my camera.,"Hi. I haven't tested it with that camcorder but am confident it will work and communicate fine. In the past there were batteries that were not decoded that would be rejected as yours did, but now the batteries are intelligent. Just like the one being sold."
I have a Sony HDR CX-160 Camcorder. Does this BPS-FV70 Lithium-Ion Battery Pack for Sony work for my CX-160?,"I have the pj 260 and this battery works, the cx160 lists the same stock battery as the 260 so it should work fine. Check the specs on both cameras, the stock battery is listed"
Can the 12v output accept a 5.5x2.5mm connector such as this: BiXPower Car Cigarette Socket to 5.5 x 2.5mm Male Barrel Connector Adapter,"The cigarette socket to 5.5x2.5 male connector adapter plugs directly into the BP160 output port. If you want to use the Z6 cable to extend from the BP160 to the adapter, you'll need the cigarette socket to 5.5x2.5 female connector adapter instead. Be sure to move the BP160 selector switch to 12V before hooking a 12V device up to the adapter."
can it charge Mac Air 13 inch notebook ?,"Yep, I use it with my retina MacBook Pro (more powerful computer) and it works fine. Just make sure you buy a MagSafe to MagSafe 2 connector (it only comes with MagSafe 1 connector), since I believe all MacBook Airs use the newer standard, as well as the retina MacBook Pros like I've got. Come to think of it, I think I have charged my cousin's MacBook Air with it and it worked fine too, so yeah I don't see any real problems. Just make sure to set the battery at the proper voltage since there's two settings."
Will this charge a cellphone using the USB out?,"Yes, it will. You will need your own charging cable, but it's a standard 5V USB port so anything you can connect to a computer USB port or a USB wall/car charger will work. I've charged an Android phone with a standard micro-USB cable with no problems."
"Can I use this with my Respironics Remstar Auto CPAP machine? If so, will that require a special adaptor or will it come with one compatible? Thanks.","If your CPAP can work with 12V DC power, yes, the battery will work for you. Actully, we do have some customers bought this battery for CPAP machine. Here is one of our customers review: ------------------------ Keeps my CPAP running about 11 hours (without using the heated humidifier). It recharges rapidly by 12 Volt DC car adapter or 110 Volt AC. I believe it might be the best-priced option out there right now for CPAP users. It is low enough in watt hours for lithium ion batteries to legally take on a plane (DOT rules) but I have not tried to do so yet. --------------------------------------------------- We are sorry that we do not know what kind connector your CPAP machine needs. This battery comes with more than 16 interchangeable connector tip. Most likely, one of them will work for you. Best regards. BiXNet"
"How long does it take to fully recharge? What are the specs on the Charger? Can you be recharging AS you are using it to power a device, a laptop?","It will take about 6 hours to fully charge the battery. The battery comes with a 16V 3.5A AC charger. You can use the battery when it is under charge. However, it is not recommend to use the battery when AC power is available: A lithium ion battery life time is about 500 full charge/discharge cycles. When you using the battery while it is under charge, the power output from battery is still from battery cells, not from the AC charger."
I have a HP pavilion dm4-3055dx Entertainment PC LAPTOP. I bought this battery pack. Do I use 12 Volt or 19 Volt? Is this safe for my laptop?,Most computer laptops have the voltage specs on the AC adapter. So check yours. I found one site that had this info: AC input voltage:100 ~ 240V 50~ 60Hz DC output voltage:19V DC output current:4.74A Power:90W So it looks like 19 volts would be your setting.
Can this be used with early 2008 and late 2009 MacBook? Does it come with the adapter?,Yes and Yes.
Is this battery safe for airline travel?,I shipped it to Qatar however this battery is heavy and don't like it.
will this battery work for an Acer Aspire 7739G-6676? Thank you.,"Look like it sure should. The Acer needs 65W, and the Bix should handle that no problem. It comes with plenty of adapters. I have only seen one computer it did not have an adapter for....The Lenovo W530 which has a proprietary plug. It should work find with 98% of the machines out there. I have 2 of these."
Is anyone using this with a Surface adapter from Mikegyver? Does it fit snugly?,"We are sorry that we have not tested it with Mikegyver adapter. The battery can provide 12V DC power, which is most MS Surface tablets are using (please check your Surface manual to make sure). The battery output port is a 5.5x2.5mm jack. If you have any Surface adapter that can plug to 5.5 x 2.5mm connector, you can use it. If you have a car charger for Surface tablet, you can buy a car cigarette female socket to 5.5 x 2.5mm male barrel connector adapter from us to convert the battery output port to a car cigarette socket, set the battery output voltage, then you can use your car charger for Surface tablet. Best regards."
I bought this computer and am unable to get sound on the hdtv/monitor I hooked it up to (Samsung T24C550ND). I am using an HDMI connection to GC.,"Just an FYI for anyone who has a similar problem, all that needs to be done is download the latest graphics drivers from the AMD website (we are not allowed to link external links here, else I would direct link it.) The default Windows ones don't seem to have everything up to snuff. All units produced after 12/15 will not have this issue."
What are the dimensions of the tower?,"Height 17"", Width 7.5"", Depth (front-to-back 18.5"""
What is the max RAM that can be upgraded?,The maxiumum RAM that the motherboard can hold is 32GBs. Currently installed is 2x 4GB sticks. There are 4 total slots available with 2 currently in use.
where to buy additional 4 Ram for this computer to increase from 8 to 12 Ram?,Any DDR3 1333MHz RAM will function with this system.
I'd like to hook up the hard drive from my current computer - how many hard drives can I add to this system and what type?,"You can add an additional 4 drives to this machine. You will need an assortment of SATA power cables (MOLEX to SATA) and SATA data cables. From there, installation is a breeze and takes just a couple of clips, all of which are included. You will not be able to hook up IDE cables directly to this machine, as there is no IDE connection on the board, but there are adapters from IDE to SATA."
"The bottom ports aren't working the middle one is lose, the top ones vga and hdmi are working but i get ATI3000 is there anyway to fix botom hdmi port",I would call AA computers at 805-499-4949 or support@AAcomps.com and ask them. Aaron has helped me in the past.
"What about the ""fan"" issue (relating to X4 concerns), is there room for a second DVD, would this be the best you have for tons of Photoshop work ?","The fan issue regarding the X4 I believe is actually moot because since the reviews that stated any fan issues, we changed the case and went with a much more efficient and ventilated case, as well as having an extra case fan now. There is room for a second... and 3rd (I just checked) DVD drive and is this the best we have for Photoshop work... no. Our technical best would be the AAC-T7S but that is not available on Amazon yet. We currently have a model called the AAC-X8 which we have in stock that would fulfill photoshop work VERY well. It has an 8 core 8320 processor, 16GBs RAM, a 2 TB hard drive and everything else that come standard (card reader, DVD drive, 3 year warranty.) We are working on getting that up and running on Amazon's catalog."
"i tried both the dvi and the vga cables for this and its still not letting me see anything, what is wrong with this?? i know for sure its nt my montr",You might be using the wrong port. The ports on top are not connected. You have to use the ones on the bottom.
okay so i was using it everything okay then next day come from school turn it on says something about ati radeon 3000 graphics now i lag everwhere,I have never experienced this problem. So far the computer is working perfectly.
Says WiFi is connected. Photo unseeable. Separate WiFi came in package. What should I do?,"It should connect to the wi-fi u currently have in your home, I had no problem hooking mine up. Try to reset your wi-fi then try again. If you can't get it contact the seller, they are great to deal with."
Does this unit hold a one xl- s that I have?,"No, this is not compatible"
Is the lever a locking device,Yes it does and it is very stable. Much better than the one that came with the GPS from the factory.
How does it attach 2 back of Tomtom- twist or push? This is round shape?,You push the Tomtom into the mount piece.
can you use this mount with the dash disk,"I've never used the dash disks, but as long as the suction cup could get a good seal against the surface of these disks, I don't see why not."
will it fit a 545?,"Sorry, I can't tell you if is fit since I don't have a 545. I just know that this one fits better than the OEM which came with purchase of my 550TM."
What is the free charger used with ?,"It is a microSD card reader, not a charger."
Can I use this with my TomTom One Canada 310 N14644?,"I would assume so. It uses the same round connection that came with my original TomTom holder. I like this one so much better because the suction to the window is stronger and easier to take off or on. The round connection is about the size of a 50cent piece or the ""okay"" symbol we make with our fingers. Hope that helps."
t do i need to attach to hear music?will they attach to a ipod?I WANT TO USE THEM TO GO TO SLEEP?,"They have a standard 1/8in headphone jack, so yes. Using headphones to go to sleep is dangerous because the cord can wrap around your neck. You may consider another option for bed."
What is their DB sound rating? Db??,"I believe there 85-90. I use them in an industrial factory where its already load so, I find it nice to block out there sounds, and control my sound level of music to beable to hear and work efficiently and safe like at the same time:)"
Woukd these headphones be considered OSHA apporved?,"I believe they are osha approved. But, many employers do not allow them because they can a break in communication."
do these have a built in microphone for communicating?,Don't waste your money on these things I bought one and used it on a Motorola radio and only one side would work i would not waste time on it
"cameras with night-vision all, I wonder if your store can offer me a kit with both options would be great for me because of the issue of packaging",Yes these cameras provide night vision for ~60feet. We don't have a premade complete system; please purchase follow products to build a system: -cameras http://www.amazon.com/Professional-700TVL-Outdoor-Surveillance-Camera/dp/B0087IQWEU/ref=cm_cd_al_qh_dp_t -DVR video recorder http://www.amazon.com/GW-Surveillance-Recorder-Resolution-Recording/dp/B00GMTTPBI/ref=sr_1_2?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1411961998&sr=1-2&keywords=gw7204c -cables http://www.amazon.com/Pre-made-Connector-Surveillance-Security-Camera/dp/B00IY0NOA6/ref=sr_1_3?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1411962077&sr=1-3&keywords=gw150cab
Can the lens be changed from 3.6 mm to 2.8 mm?,Thank you for your inquiry. Unfortunately we don't carry any lens. And we don't recommend buyers changing the lens on their own as any modifications to the camera unit will automatically void its warranty.
"I noticed it doesn't have IR cut. Will this adversely affect picture quality during lighted hours, also, what is auto electronic shutter?",The camera has a button control for adjusting its background lighting. You can reduce the amount of light the camera receives from ambient light with the button control.
"Will this camera work with ""SANNCE Pre-Installed 1 TB Hard Drive 16 Channel DVR"", ASIN: B00L2YNCM6?",Yes these cameras will work with DVR B00L2YNCM6
"Are the cameras wireless, if so how long does they battery last? Is the battery rechargeable? how do you view what the camera records? Can they be","Thank you for your inquiry. These cameras are not wireless nor battery powered. In order to build a working camera system, you'll need the cameras, a DVR recorder, cabling, and power supplies. Please visit the following link to view a complete 4 camera system: http://www.amazon.com/GW-Security-Inc-4CHE6-Varifocal/dp/B00HUDY09M/ref=sr_1_41?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1399270112&sr=1-41&keywords=gw+4camera+system"

This camera is waterproof?,"Yes, it is waterproof."
"Tonight I tried the Airplay feature with my iPad on iOS7, and it does not work. I am thinking it has issues with IOS7? Anyone has similar issue?",I have this receiver and it works with my iPad that's running the latest iOS. Does the other network-based features work for you (i.e. Pandora)?
Does this model connects bluetooth without buying additional bluetooth adapter to connect wirless headset?,"No, you have buy an adapter, the newer model may have bluetooth built in."
Can I use a turntable with build in amp with this unit,"As long as it has outputs on it, then yes, you should be able to."
Is Aventage worth the price compared to the standard models??,You really just get an extra year of warranty and some minor changes... Middle foot etc. I would say it depends on the current price.. If it's within 100$ I would opt for the aventage
Does it work with europen voltage standard (220-240v)?,Yes but you would need a step up transformer to pass it through.
Does zone 2 put out audio from all HDMI inputs? I would like to connect a TV to the HDMI 2 out and connect my external speakers to Zone2 out.,"I believe zone 2 will take any audio source from the receiver... However, HDMI Out 2 will only mirror what is on HDMI Out 1. It will not let you output two separate video streams. Hope that helps!"
is the microphone has multi-point measurement or just single point measurement?,"You can setup your speakers using either way. They can be setup for single point or for multi point. For details, you need to read the User Manual on pages 35 for single and 38 for multiple."
One reviewer stated that in order to use zone 2 the receiver must be in party mode. Is that correct?,"Zone 2 allows you to play from a different source than Zone 1. You can have Zone 1 playing a movie on 7.2 Surround while Zone 2 can be listening to the Radio or playing from other sources (some limitations apply, so you need to read the User Manual for details). Party Mode is used to listen to the same source on both Zone 1 and 2 at the same time. Typical use would be listening to Radio or internet on all speakers when you have a party at home (hence the name ""Party Mode"")."
can I get this receiver with 220 volts?,I doubt it. A step down transformer will always be cheaper that a buck and boost transformer or step up.
where is this made?,China I believe... Where all Yamaha products are manufactured.
"What is the distance between the front of the receiver to the back feet on receiver? My cabinet is only 17"" but the back is magnetic so will remove.","The total unit depth is 17 inches, but you will also need space for the connections on the back."
Does this AV receiver receive both AM HD &amp; FM HD radio stations?,The specs say it does - have not used that feature myself though.
Does zone 2 accept digital audio sources?,"Yes, same sources as the main zone"
"Has anyone noticed a delay between zone 1 and zone 2 when using ""party"" mode when using USB/iPhone, server or internet radio?",i don't have a problem with that hmmmm will look in to it
"If set the receiver's impedance at 6 ohm so I can plug in a 6 ohm speaker, can I still use the 8 ohms speakers at the same time?","I'd leave the selector at 8ohm and run the mix of 6 and 8 ohm speakers. It should be fine. The only way you'd run into a problem is with 4ohm speakers, and in that case you should be using a discrete amplifier."
will aventage rx-a1020 work with lg tv.,"As long as the LG TV has HDMI or Component input, yes."
Is it possible to operate Yamaha receivers zone 1 and 2 at the same time without the surround sound speakers turning off?,"Yes, this is the way I use it. I use the surround sound inside and zone 2 is set up outside."
will the Aventage 1020 work with a Samsung Smart TV?,That's exactly what we have and it's been working well for a year.
IS MODEL 1020 A MULTI VOLTAGE 110/220 VOLTS UNIT?,"It is available as a multi-voltage unit, but the ones normally sold in the US are 110 volts only. The ""General Model"" is the multi-voltage version. There are other differences too. Only the ""US"" model can receive HD radio; RDS tuning is in the US and Europe models only; traffic info via FM is in Europe and UK models only; the remote control has programmable learning instead of codes for other remotes in the ""China, Korea, UK and Europe models only"". Download the instruction manual from Yamaha and read carefully to pick up these differences."
"Hello, is it multivoltage, 110 - 220V ? Thanks a lot!","No, 110-115V only."
would like to use this to power 3 zones - 2 sets of speakers each in zone 2 and zone 3. what else do I need for zones 2/3?,"i have this receiver and love it. I power 3 zones with it. All you need is speakers for zone 2 and 3. No additional amplifiers needed as all 3 zones are powered by the receiver itself. if you run 2 sets of speakers per zone, make sure your speakers have an impedance matching the receivers impedance. Do your research about how to connect them to not generate the wrong impedance. Connect speakers in series: add up impedance and you are on the safe side. If your wiring does not allow to connect them in series, make sure each of the 2 speakers you connect in parallel have double the impedance than the minimum impedance your receiver can support. Example: minimum impedance 8Ohms means you could either run 2 speakers each 4 ohms or higher in series (totals to 8 Ohms or higher) OR 2 speakers 16 ohms or higher in parallel (totals 8 ohms or higher)."
Deciding btw this and the A1020 model. Don't care about 9 zones/140W. Biggest Q: are the advanced music enhancer and the VIDA chipset worth extra $$?,"I am not sure abut the music enhancer, I just know it sounds great, I do know the VIDA chipset definitely has improved the video display, in general very happy with this receiver and would repurchase. Mike C"
where can i purchase a dual voltage unit,Hi. they don't make dual voltage. You will need a good power inverter. thank you
"I'm worried about plugging a KEF E305 into this receiver... Would they ""blow up""? The support until 100W and this receiver has 140W. Tks","No, they won't blow up. Yamaha's automated room EQ, called YPAO, should set your speakers to their appropriate levels. You may also adjust each channel individually in the on-screen system settings menu (impendence, range, DBS, etc.) Finally, you can enable Yamaha's ""Adaptive Dynamic Range Control"" which globally prevents any dramatic or sudden high's or lows. Your KEFs will sound great on the 2020."
Can I stream music from my PC using the Yamaha AV Controller app only (i.e. without connecting the receiver to a TV set to navigate on-screen menus)?,Yes - the Receiver goes to the settings automatically and plays when it's selected as the output device on your PC
Does it has Voltage selector (110-240v)... does it work with european 220v???,Just looked at mine: no voltage selector. On the rear panel it says 110V. So it does not work with 220V in Europe.
Can you play the three separate zones simultaneously with 3 different types of music in each zone?,Yes
does this unit rquire the bluetooth wireless audio adapter (YBA-11) for Airplay?,"No, it comes ready for wifi."
Do I still get the manufactures warranty with this used product from Amazon Warehouse Deals?,Don't know. I bought mine new from Amazon
Intelligent amp assign turns off rear surrounds for zone outputs. Is this the same thing that happens in party mode? Or does sound play through ALL,I decided not using zones 2 and 3 since it only works with RCA cables. I use digital cables for better sound quality. And surrounds in main zone area work in all modes except if you select 2 speakers. Good luck
what would be a good set of speakers to go with this reciever,A good set of serious speakers for your new receiver would be the Polk LSiM707. It is a blast.
Can this unit be connected to Sirius?,"Assuming you mean satellite radio, the answer would be, not directly, but because you can access the internet, you could listen at the Sirius/XM web site."
Does this receiver have HDMI 2.0?,"S. Soporta video 3D, retorno de audio, etc."
Is this receiver's input voltage 100-240v? or Only 110v?,Input voltage is only 120 Volts. A. C. in USA/Canada model. In other models (General and Asia models) is posible to switch 110-120 v. or 220-240 v.
Can someone explain Intelligent Amp Assign? I am getting the impression that the system will never allow 9.1 channels in the main room.,"I cant explain intelligent amp assign very well, but I think it means you can assign the amps to certain speakers you already have set up in the ""on screen menu"" of the receiver. I have all the 9.2 speakers set up in my room. Its 7.2 plus 2 front presence speakers and 2 rear presence speakers and 2 more speakers for use if you have an external amp. I hope this helps and tried to explain the best I can."
How does this 150 wpc match up with a sansui g-9000's 160 wpc? I have a pair of polk rti a9's that need to be fed and I don't have a fortune.,You will not hear a difference with 10 watts and this receiver will definitely drive your RTI9's.
Can you only hook up 1 sub? Im only seeing 1 Sub out on the back of the receiver.,"There are 2 sub outs. In the on screen menu, you can select the 2 subs to be front and rear, or left and right, or mono."
",",I don't recommend it. It often loses its Bluetooth connection and isn't audible over 35 mph even with the volume turned up.
Will this fit the Harley half helmets?,It fit in my hd half helmet.
Has anyone used this with the TomTom rider 2013?,works great!
Is that $168.00 for ONE meaning it would cost me $336.00 to talk with my wife?,SENA does sell a dual pack with two sets in a box. Part number is: SPH10H-FMD-01
Will this work on a Ski helmet?,"Not sure what ski helmet you have , but if it has opening where your ears go like above helmet so the Sena dials fit through like above pic your good. If you have closed ear area like full face helmets then NO it wont work . They do make other models for those type of helmets . Hope this helps. Bob G"
Will it fit my Bell Pit Boss Helmet?,If your helmet currently has your ears exposed YES it will fit/work. Unit is amazing up to 80 mph better than any bluetooth I've owned and I pretty much have owned them all.
I e-mailedto Sena. I read on your forum that other people have asked about battery replacement on the SPH10H. Yet I do not see a positive response. I,"I called the company. They said it was possible but not recommended. Whenever we not using, we leave them on the charger. I also asked the company if this would hurt the battery and they said it would not. This works well with our headsets."
The book says the batteries are non-removeable. What happens when they no longer take a charge?,i have no idea about it sorRy my friend. now we are two people with the same question !
MP3 not blutooth. Will passenger pick up music if plugged intodriveronlhy?,no they won't share music. They are set up to hot mic so when 2 headsets are connected only what goes through the mic will be transmitted to the other headset.
What is the hearing and speaking quality with half helmet and no windshield?,Listening to music is ok but as far as talking and hearing a conversation is a little difficult without a windshield. The windshield helps cut down the wind noise and hearing is greatly improved. Hope this helps.
Once setting the output frequency will it stay in memory the next time you turn it on?,Yes it stays on the station you set it to.
Does the adaptor stay in place? Is it compatable with an iphone4s? Does it charge at the same time that it plays music?,"I'm not sure what you mean by the adaptor. The charger stays firmly in place in the power socket, and the cords attach firmly. The FM transmitter stays in place when attached to the MP3 player (or phone). It does swivel, but that's not an issue. Since it attaches where you plug in headphones, it is a universal device. You can attach it to anything that will take a headphone plug. The charger has a USB connection that is separate from where the cord for the transmitter connects, so you can charge a device at the same time you're using the transmitter, though I've never tried this. However, the charger does not charge your device through the transmitter itself. You do have to connect to the charger with a separate cord to do this. I hope this helps you."
Would this work with a case like the griffin survivor or life proof?,It probably would not work. I have a similar case like the life proof. I could not fully plug in because the 3.5mm isn't that long. I had to take mine off to listen to music.
Does earphone plug reach when connected with a iphone with an OtterBox defender case on it?,My son hasn't complained of that being an issue. But there seems to be plenary of cord to accomplish this.
Do u need a aux in your car already,No you do not. The transmission goes straight to your radio
"The transmitter has a microphone(small hole on top). What is this for? It does not transmit to my radio,",The only hole mine has is for the charger
I am getting a lot of static when using this device. Have tried different channels but it is the same. Any suggestions?,"I first used the transmitter on an older vehicle and went in and out of static depending on my area. I got a newer vehicle and have a completely different experience. It probably has to do with the actual frequency your cars audio system is actually able to maintain. Unless you have a newer car, this would be my guess."
Is it UL certified?,DAFUK is that?
is it compatable for blackberry smart phones?,It's compatible with all phones uses the aux jack.
"Will leaving it plugged in when the car is off drain the battery? I noticed the blue light stays on even when the car is off, is that bad?","Yes, it will but the drain would be very minimum. If your battery is strong, I would not worry about it."
Anyone know what the difference is between this Sena SM10 and the Sena SR10 that's on Amazon?,"The SM10 is a STEREO Bluetooth transmitting device! You'll get audio quality out of the SM10. While, the SR10 is a radio transceiver/mono-audio Bluetooth transmitting device. You'd use the SR10 to connect with Bluetooth to a CB radio. Both of the devices connect well to the SENA SMH10 motorcycle helmet head-set."
How does this work with the 2013 Goldwing CB? Can I hear/speak using my SMH10 headset?,"I use the SMH10 headset to communicate (talk/listen) with other headsets as if the SM10-01 were not present. I use the SM10-01 to listen to the GW audio output cable that is plugged into the SM10-01. This provides the GW with an audio output cable (radio, gps, CB) to bluetooth transmission which can be monitored with the SMH10 headsets. While you should be able to listen to the CB, this setup does not provide the 2-way bluetooth link required to use the GW intercom or mic/keying of a CB."
"Does this work with any other headsset than the sena, I have a LG Tone 730 that I use for my phone",The SM10 uses A2DP technology so it can connect to other brands of headsets.
Will this work with my 2014 Can-Am Spyder RT? Looks like the same unit as Can-Am but half the price.,"The SM10 is a universal Bluetooth hub. I used it for my two helmets on my wing. You do have to plug it into your audio device though. It worked well for what i had planned to use it for. I am ot familiar with the Spyder, in regard to the bluetooth functions."
Can this be used while being charged? I want to use with my tv to connect 2 bluetooth headsets at home. Anyone also know about audio latency?,"Of course it can be used, the ones we use on our motorcycles are on charge while we are riding. And there won't be any Latency, but you will have to use it with the SMH10 headset. I don't believe you can use it with any other Bluetooth head set. But are you planning on using just one headset or two?"
What is the range of the BT.,About 30 feet
Can I hear my fm radio on a can am spyder RTS,"If you can plug it in to the SM-10 with a cable, yes. The 1 Bluetooth connection would go to the headset"
I bought a Quadzilla fairing from Reckless cycle it has a Sony head stereo unit. will this work with that? It's mounted on a 09 Yamaha Roadstar Silverado,If the fairing has a 3.5 mm audio out jack then this will connect to it and transmit the audio on bluetooth. This is a transmitter only and will not receive audio through bluetooth.
"I ride a 1994 gold wing, how do I connect a smart phone to my old style radio ?",Sena makes an adapter that plugs into the Goldwing rider DIN plug that goes into the helmet speakers. The din plug (five pins) converts to 3.5mm stereo plug so you can listen to your bike radio ( Bluetooth ). Paste link and you see what I mean. You also need a ground loop isolator to remove electrical noise. LINK-----&gt; http://senabluetooth.com/product/adapters/sm10/#tab-accessories
Where can i find the optional cables for onboard motorcycle audio systems such as Harley Ultra Classic so I can use the SM10-01,"Simply ""Google"" 5 and 7 pin DIN cable jacks for the Sena SM10 and you'll get something like: http://www.rakuten.com/prod/sena-3-5mm-stereo-jack-to-5-pin-din-cable-sm10-dual-stream-stereo/254275778.html?listingId=318261115&scid=pla_google_Perfmoto&adid=18179&gclid=CP7U34__x70CFUVp7AodxHUA2A"
Is this unit waterproof/resistant? Just want to make sure it won't get damaged if it starts raining.,"I have not used it n a heavy downpour. I've been in light rain situations and had no problems. The plugs all fit snugly. I'd be comfortable saying water resistant more than waterproof. That said, I've had mine (two units) nearly a year and have been very happy with the units."
Can I pair two cellphones at the same time?,"Haven't tried 2 cellphones at the same time, but you can have a cellphone and an iPod in use at the same time. I do it with my IPhone 5 and my old 2nd gen iPod. The battery lasts longer on the iPod for music and I don't drain my phone. Although, I have learned that the battery on the headset only lasts for 4 hours of consistent play. Found that out on a trip from Houston TX to Albany GA"
if i buy this unit can i add another one in the future to be able to communicate between 2 riders?,"Yes. All Sena units can be paired together up to, I believe, 4 units. I bought the kit that came with 2 in the box and then I added the Sena SPH-10H and paired it to the other 2. It all works great! All Sena units are compatible with each other. ENJOY!!!"
can u use it with any brand helmet i have the LS2 open face will i clip on to it,"The controller will clip to nearly any helmet (full, 3/4, or open), but you would need to purchase/use the optional boom microphone (not the velcro mount mic included in this kit) for open or 3/4 helmets. You could also just purchase the SMH5-01 kit that does include a boom mic. With the 02 kit you will not be able to find a suitable/convenient place in an open or 3/4 helmet to mount the mic. http://www.amazon.com/Sena-Attachable-Microphone-Bluetooth-Headset/dp/B008BYQ8JO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1393459829&sr=8-1&keywords=sena+boom"
Is rider to rider communication voice activated? I read the manual and it appears you have to actually touch the multip function buttton on the side.,"Yes, you must press the button to initiate the intercom function. Once activated you can talk back and forth. Do do not use it like a ouch to talk button. Hope that helps."
Will the unit fit into the compartment on an HJC IS MAX BT helment?,Yes it's very slim it's flat speakers and wires.
"""....compatibility with select motorcycle gps systems""--Will this unit also work with automobile bluetooth Garmin Nuvi, mounted on motorcycle?",No
I have the LS2 Helmets OF569 Open Face Motorcycle Helmet. Will this system work with this helmet?,Shure. But there is a wire that is not the ideal thing to use. I use ir in a open face helmet also. I glued the microfone at centre of the glass. It works perfectly.
Can you listen to Pandora? My new GPS 390LM offers Pandora functionality but my old Scala headset doesn't pick it up - only GPS &amp; phone.,"Yes it does stream music such as pandora, iTunes Radio, etc. When use in conjunction with GPS on the phone, the music will fade when directions go on via GPS and then back on to normal volume. It functions just like it would on your phone speaker or wired headset."
Does this have an audio jack for my earbuds?,No there is not...
why do i need a lan adapter when the dvd blue ray supposedly came with wirless ready?,"Unfortunately Panasonic does not make this very clear on the BluRay box. The player, depending on model is ""wireless ready"" but requires the LAN adapter to connect to your wi-fi as it does not have the required circuitry internally to receive and process the wi-fi signal. My Blu Ray was network ready - if I used an ethernet cable, but required the adapter for wifi. I guess it is way to sell an accessory. This is a throwback to early laptops that required a wifi usb adapter to connect."
I have a dmp-bd79p-k will this let me get on wifi with this product?,Yes the only way. I assume because this product does not come with built in wi-fi.
does it need to be close to the router as i bump off my landlords which is below me,I used a net gear wireless LAN since it was way cheaper at walmart and picks up signal from over a 100' away so that m sure that will work for you.
Does this work on my sa-btt196,"According to the Manual, yes this will work with SA-BTT196."
Will the DY-WL5 Adaptor work with Panasonic DMR-HWT130EB PVR HDD Recorder,I bought it and no it won't work.
Can this adapter work with Panasonic VIERA TC-P65ST60 65-Inch,I have no idea. I went to the panasonic site and cross referenced all adapters until I found this one.
Will this adapter work with the Panasonic Viera TC-P5S30 Plasma TV?,"I'm not sure, Lance. Sorry! You may wish to ask the Panasonic Customer support team. Good luck."
Can you tell me if this LAN Adaptor works for the model SA-BT230 Blu Ray,This works fine for me. I've never had a problem with it.
"Will this work on pan tcl47e5,and will I need anything else","I'm not really certain if it will work with that set, but I don't see why it wouldn't. The setup is very easy and straightforward and you should not need anything other than a wifi connection."
are wireless lan adapters interchangeable,"No, I tried buying a wireless LAN adapter first but it didn't work for me so I had to buy Panasonic's. The packaging on my home theater was deceptive & their customer service was completely incompetent - they lost a customer. I hope you have better luck..."
Is there an Internet site that explains how to work this! I'm stumped on who to install?,I also would like to know this

Does this product work without a data sim card?,No it will not without a simm. Walmart sells simm cards and data cards.
Where do I get a SIM card for this -- has anyone had any good reviews about this product?,ANy cell phone SIM card will work. I got mine from AT&T
I like to know if working in other country (brasil),"It really works in any country,just insert a Simcard(pre-paid),and follow instructions."
comes with car wired charger?,It does not come with a car charger. But it does not matter because it is impossible to set up & does not work. It is nicely packaged though. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.
Will this work outside of the US?,"Yes it will work outside the USA, It works with a GSM data sim card and supports the quad band (850/900/1800/1900Mhz). The Data Sim Card is not included."
bought this tracker but where do i buy the sim card to make it work?,"Cell Phones are required by US law to be able to call 911 without a SIM card. Whether the 911 Services know the GPS coordinates is dependant on the local capability of the 911 Response Center and the capabilities of the cell towers provided by the telecom service company. It is mandated by 2019 all 911 Dispatch centers, cell service providers, and cell phones transmit GPS coordinates during 911 calls in the United States. Currently if 911 is called in many location they will only triangulate location using cell towers. To serve as a location service to track people and geo bound them it would require a SIM card. I recommend in this case to buy a prepaid T-Mobile SIM card of $100 so that the minutes won't expire for a year. Until the total amount of minutes bought on T-Mobile prepaid add up to $100 the minutes expire in 3 months."
"Am i correct is assuming that with this plugged in, i will be able to listen to my stock radio &amp; cb, but not be able to talk via my cb?","You have 2 options: The SENA SC A0120 Plug In Cord is one option and it will work. Or, if you still want Bluetooth you have to purchase the Sena SM10-01 SM10 Dual Stream Bluetooth Stereo Transmitter. You mount it on your bike and plug into bike connection. The difference is; you will have no cords connecting to your helmet. It will work thru the blue tooth connection."
will this plug directly into the smh 10?,Yes
Is the 7 pin adapter also for Can Am Spyders,"I really don't think it will work, Sena is Very misleading about this plug. They say it will work with the Harley and the Goldwing. But all it will do is let you listen to the radio, if you have a CB radio. You can hear but not transmit. What year and model Spyder do you have?"
Has anyone been successful downloading from google play?,"Hi Kathryn - yes, we have been able to download apps from the Google Play store. But a few months ago, the ability to stay connected to the internet became an issue and it is pretty much unusable (my husband no longer even tries to use it). So your problem could be sustaining an internet connection. Haven't found any solution to that problem, personally."
Can you install chromecast on this device,I believe you can.
how to set up,Sorry can't help. I returned it. Didn't work for me.
Why it keeps having sync errors with my google account preventing me from accessing the play store?,"I am not sure, what's going on, all I know is it is very very! Slow. The ony thing it is really good for in angry birds, my husband tried to use it for work no luck. Sorry don't know why else to say. But the $160.00 I paid for it was to much for just something for a game."
MiTravelor 97C4 9.7 Tablet PC LCD Android 4.0 Tablet/ Is this any good,"Rachel, This tablet looks great and works well--until it breaks which is early and often. Bought mine March 2013 It is currently sent back to Tivax for thr second time First time the OS stopped functioning correctly. This time the OS won't start. Costs me $11 each time to send it back. I could not recommend this tablet therefore.George"
Does anyone else notice that wi-fi connectivity is weak?,"Yes...it depends on the type of connection you are using. My husband is staying in a long term hotel and using the free WiFi and he has troubles keeping a connection. However, at home, connecting to our router, he has no problems at all. Keep looking for a stronger connection."
Why won't two weather apps I have downloaded work?,"Most weather apps use location data and/or a GPS signal to ascertain where you are,thus providing the current weather.This tablet is not equipped with a GPS or cellular antenna so it is not able to run weather specific apps."
i have heard some cables are not bi direction for sending are theese bi directional,"Yes, but ..... Soon after starting to use the cable, the conductor for red became sporadic. I can jiggle the cable at the plug and get the red to come back off and on. This had to be a fabrication problem when the cable was made. Spend more $ and get a heavier duty cable."
"I have no place to screw connector in to my laptop, will this work?",I don't have mine screwed in and it works perfectly fine.
Will this work with Dell 20 inch LCD monitor--about 5 years old?,Absolutely.
Will this work with an old destop computer connected to a new LED TV? I want to use the TV screen as a TV and as a computer monitor.,"As long as your TV has a standard VGA input, this cable will work very nicely for you."
what packaging does it come in? retail / box....,"IIRC, it was in a small box."
this cable eliminate the ghost effect? a noise in the screen. i need to replace my original cable my benq lcd monitor 1366x768 resolution.,"Hi Gladys, Yes, it will eliminate the ghost effect for you. Please email support@cablematters.com if you have any further questions. Thanks, Cable Matters Support"
Will this cable work with a MAC Mini port to VGA adapter to a thunderbolt monitor?,Yes.
Will this support 1600 by 900? Will it block static from my outlet and other cords?,Yes
does this output 1920x1080 or higher?,"My monitors are running at 1600x900 with this cable and no issues. I have not tried to go any higher, however I think the cable will support that resolution. As the old saying goes, copper wire is just that -- copper wire."
Do I need to purchase an audio cable in order to get sound from my laptop to my tv?,Yes. This cable is for video only.
How well does the audio convert? One customer stated the audio does not come out of his left speaker. Has anyone else had a problem when using this device?,I've had no issues with audio or video whatsoever. Looks and sounds great to me.
will this work with a wii mini,It's not working w/ my Wii Mini... tv doesn't recognize it and the red light on the converter doesn't turn on.
Does the sound come with the HDMI video output? Or do I have to use the audio out to get any sound?,"HDMI cable worked with AV receiver just fine ... both video and audio signal from Wii to receiver, then video signal to TV and audio to external speakers. I did not need to use a separate audio output."
"So is anyone using this device for a 720p output, some answers say there is not a switch, does it autoswitch?",It does not change the output to be 720p. It only converts the signal to HDMI. The quality is the same as a regular component cable.
Does it work for the Wii mode on the Wii U?,"It should work fine with the Wii mode on the Wii U, but it would be regular Wii quality, not HD."
"I get audio, but not video from this product. I've connected it to an AVR (receiver). The TV is 720P, but that shouldn't matter, no?",Should not matter
Would this work on a GameCube? I think it and the Wii use the same video wiring.,This will only work for your GameCube if the slot for outputting Video is the same type of slot as the Wii. Usually these are unique to each game system. I do not have a game cube or I could check for you. However this link a person posted that you CANNOT use the same cable http://techforums.nintendo.com/message/60132. If you need to convert from the AV cables on the gamecube to HDMI look at this Amazon link...
"When I plug into my TVs HDMI outlet and set it as an input, the TV shuts down. Could there be a voltage issue with this device?","No, the voltage does not change whith this device."
"If I get this for the Wii U, will the quality be significantly worse than using an HDMI cable directly? (my hdmi port is broken on the wii u)","No, the quality gonna be the same as an HDMI cable."
Does this introduce and appreciable lag with games like Guitar Hero?,I don't believe to have notice any lag.
I need it for the new Galaxy S4 Phone ... will it work with that phone?,Every phone I put this card in has worked but you have to format it everytime. You can't swap it between phones. Once its formatted for that phone load it up and go.
will this work with a galaxy s5?,It should because I had a Galaxy S4 mine worked and they have the same basic system...
What class is this memory card?,In the technical details it says this micro SD memory card is class 10.
does this play books on cd?,I would be very surprized if it didn't play CD everything.....
are you able to use a wall adapter where batteries are not required?,"Yes, I bought a wall adapater, also. So when I use it at home, I don't use up the batteries."
Would the large accommodate the size of cord used for a curling iron?,Yes
Does this work with apple ear buds with inline mic and volume control. OK if those parts and the plug don't recoil,The recoil only stops when you're at the end of the line. It's spring-loaded and the inline volume control will recoil through the mechanism. It's fine if you don't mind that happening.
Does it seem like this product could be used to retract a thin ethernet cable?,Yes. Very well. My head phone cable is about the same size.
Is there a way to reduce the pressure these use to wind the cord?,"I will tell you my own personal fix. The spool is wound roughly nine or ten revolutions when it's made. If you loop a string or cable around the hook, you can let it revolve one or two turns, stop it with your finger and then gently remove the string. The pressure increases with every revolution, so this will reduce the pressure. Sometimes doing this means that i have to help the cord in the last few cm, but it's worth it for me. If you don't like the effect, you can always wind it up again by threading the string around the spool once, looping it onto the hook and pulling the spool around. Just make sure you don't over wind it, because that can damage it. You'll be able to feel the pressure building as you wind. Hope that helps!"
"Does the item allow you to pull the cord ends out just part of the way, and keep them at that adjusted length&gt;","Boltar: Good question. Unfortunately the answer is no. At present, the product will pull the cable in until it bottoms out, and doesn't have a part-way stop. (I've had times when I wanted my cord part way out, and I've found that a small binder clip is an effective, though not elegant solution.)"
Would this keep the slack out between my iPod on my wrist &amp;my headphones? I need to be able to stretch my arm &amp; return w/o slack or excess pressure.,I think it's too bulky for that. I like the idea but not sure it will work for that purpose.
"Will this handle a 10 ft USB cable? I have a 3, 6, &amp; 10 ft cable for my ipad2 &amp; Classic iPod.",The larger size should. The smaller one I don't think so.
Looking for something similar to a extension cord winder where I can only take out the length I need. Does anyone know of a similar product for a usb?,"The Recoil Automatic Cord Winder will allow you to use the length of cord you need when both ends of the cord are in use. When the cord is not in use, it retracts back in to the winder. Kind of like a cord yo-yo for longer cords."
does it have bluetooth so i can answer my phone calls ??,No not this model. If I'm correct there is one with bluetooth. I hope it's was help in enough
can u hear voices in the recordings?,Yea I heard them really well I used them inbthe army and even with all the loud noises you can hear it pretty well.
how long is the video recording time in HD,Ive usually gotten a good 20-30 minute segments at a time.
How do you charge the battery?,you have to leave it plugged in for a couple hrs because there is very little or no power in the battery
can i put 32 micro sd card?,There is no expansion port on the glasses. The max is either the 8 or 16gb.
can i put 32 gb micro sd card,"No, memory is built in (no slot for additional memory card)."
it comes with memory card?,Yes
Does it fit on woman?,I didn't try
I have the glasses but I have lost the usb cable. I have tried to buy another usb cable but any other is working. Could you sell just the usb cable?,The cable is nothing special. Common camera cable.
can i put music on these?,"Yes, it is simple and fast as a mp3 player"
I spend more time emptying water from my ears so i can hear the audio than I do swimming. How do i stop the infiltration of water?,Have you tried changing the ear cushions to see if one set works better than the other two?
"But, the question is... Is this really waterproof? seeing the reviews has made me feel ALOT better, but still. I. HAVE. BAD. LUCK.",Yes! It is waterproof.
Does the two year warentee come backed with the product with the purchase or is it that canopy warentee i have to pay for?,I did not pay separately for a warranty.
what strap can I purchase to attach it to my arm,"It has a built in clip behind it which clips to your bathing suit or eye goggles. I clip it to my eye goggles on the top strap on the top of my head, wind the cord through the velcro, and have the ear buds coming out from the back of my head. I hope this helps!"
Do you have to use the cap?,no
will this work in the ocean? is it strong enough to stay clipped on if you are surfing and get knocked off your board? will the sand cause damage?,I would say it depend what you have it clipped on to.. I think the unit it built very well.. I have been super hAppy with mine.. worst case scenario you could put a pilot hole in the clip side and use a camera laynard
Will the earphones still work during flipturns?,"Hi I'm not sure, I only do breast stroke. I have got water in my ears when the pool has been busy."
WIll this work with any remote control?,"I'm not sure, although I assume any I/R remote will work. My remote is DirecTV and it works great."
will it work with directv satellite box,Yes! Hooked it up to the spare satellite box I had in mechanical room in my garage. We did put the sensors outside the door to the mechanical room so only garage door was between the sensors and the garage across the street (about 250'+ away). We had IR before but it went out and couldn't get replacements to work. They kept malfunctioning/burning out. This has been working for 6+ months now and actually has better response when changing channels than other system we had. We channeled cable from main house underground to the remote garage along with transmitter but the transmitter went down. Box is in main house. Happy to finally have a solution!
Will this work with a Logitech Harmony Ultimate One Remote to control the on/off for a JVC projector?,I had poor results with this brand. I also bought the Term Leapfrog remote extenders and they work much better. I would not recommend the Monoprice.
Any tips to get this to work with Direct TV? I can get it to work behind cabinet doors with every component but that. - thanks.,I have my receiver module nearly in front of my DirecTV receiver on the left hand side as you are looking at the front. It works fine from inside my shop which is next door to the house.
Can I use the remote directly line of site Receiver box AND as a relay from a remote location or does it cover the IR port and only work as a relay?,"Beats me. I could not get this unit to work directly or indirectly. In fact, I'm not sure why Amazon would ask me since I returned the unit for full credit. Sorry."
"I have 2 boxes next to each other, TVs are in other rooms. Can I put two of these side by side do they have distinct RF channels?","Just to be sure I am understanding your configuration, you have two devices together you want to control from two separate remote locations. The extender itself doesn't have channels, but you don't need that. You get two of these extenders, but you only use one receiver at the location where you have the boxes. You have one sender with each remote TV location. Whichever sender you are using relays the remote commands to the receiver, the receiver relays the command to the box. If you are trying to allow the two different TV users/locations to control different boxes at the same time, (like one person is watching off the dvr in one room, someone else is watching the blu-ray in the other room) then you need a different extender brand from each location to its own receiver co-located with the boxes. Hope that answers your question."
Will this work with verizon fios set top box non dvr,"It works with any IR device, just need to place the receiver in front of your device and transmitter on the location were you operate the remote."
Arris RNG150N (Xfinity) -- will not control?,These are junk in every way.
WIll this work with any remote control?,It should they just change the signal from ir to rf u just have to place the receiver in the proper area or use the little ir peice and place it in front of box
How is this product installed?,"Just plug into Satellite or cable box and also into electric outlet. The second one goes to remote TV and is plugged into an electric outlet as well. Very simple setup. My Direct TV remote works with it. I just point it toward the remote and it changes channels, etc."
Some people said that it fits the 13 inches MacBook Air perfectly; others said too loose. Are the 2012 &amp; 2013 Air in different sizes?,I would send it back then. An obvious defect. Fit perfect with my air without a case. Now I have a TopCase Rubberized Hard Case for Macbook Air 13-Inch - A1369 and A1466 with TopCase Mouse Pad - Black and it fits even better which it fit perfectly in the first place.
Can I put the 2013 MacBook Air 13 inches in the main pocket and its charger in the front pocket?,"Yes, but that will probably permanently stretch out the neoprene."
Will it fit a 13.3 Macbook Pro with a hard shell snap on case?,Yes- i fit my 15 inch macbook pro in this case and it works beautifully!
Would this case also fit a 15 inch Apple MacBook Pro WITHOUT retina display?,"Yes. I have the 15 inch macbook pro without retina display and I love this case. I also have a speck hardshell protective case on my macbook, and even with that it still fits in this case. :)"
"I have a macbook 15 inch WITH OUT retina display and I also have a speck case on it, would I have hard time putting laptop in and out of the sleeve?",I think it would be a rather tight fit with the case on it. I do not have a case on mine and have no problem but the fit is snug. Might not be the right sleeve for you.
"I have a Toshiba Satellite 15 inch laptop, would this case still fit it?","No it will not. I ordered it for my 11.6"" Mac, I had a shell on it and it did not fit."
Will this fit even if I have a case on it? It would be tight-fitting like a Speck,It fit fine with mine with a case no problem
how many pins are in the micro end,"I'm sure its the reular number of pins, but I am not sure it used the extras for power to charge the Nook quickly. Without the light on the plug to tell you it's charging or green whencharged, I really couldn't tell. B&N lowered the price on the cable to $9.95, so I bought 2."
Did you use this product with the Nook Color specifically??,"it was a nook tablet , the second gen that came out, it is the ""Tablet"" model, however all the cords I have purchased from B&N were marked as Nook Color cords and worked with my Tablet, this cord works just as good if not better than the B&N cord, plus it is 4 times cheaper. I recommend giving it a chance."
can I download data from my computer to my Nook using this cable?,Yes. You can use your nook just like a USB storage device. Attach it to your computer and save to your Nook device.
Does this also work on other devices such as Kindle?,I don't know if the Kindle has the same connector as the Nook. I hope someone else is able to answer your question!
Does this fit the Nook Simple Touch 2? Model # BNRV300. Thank you!,"Sorry, I have no idea. I have a Nook color and it was compatible with that one. I don't know if it would be compatible with the Nook Simple Touch 2 or not."
Does this work for the original Nook Glow-light?,I don't know that. I have noon color and it works for that.
does this work on nook color?,"I wouldn't try it, but it's up to you. The listing specifies the cable's compatibility with the Nook SIMPLE TOUCH, so proceed with caution. If it doesn't work for something outside of what it's advertised for, don't be surprised. I've seen hit and miss with people trying to use this cable for the Nook Color."
for nook tablet?,I purchased this for my daughters nook color... it did arrive quickly but did NOT WORK... i have tried it on several other devices and it did not work on them either... i did however discovet that my samsung phone charger will work.. just takes it longer to charge
i just asked this under a comment but is there a specific button that has to be pressed a certain way to get this to take a solar charge?,I could not figure that one out. The power button does not work on my unit. Based on the horribly written instructions and reference to possible problems with the power button I inferred that the manufacturer knew there were problems before they sent them out. When plugging the unit in to charge there were lights indicating that a charge was taking place. Other solar charging devices that I have use a led light to indicate that the unit is charging.
"Today I received the product, I exposed to the sun does not indicate and not load anything, what would be the downside?.",don't buy this product!..its a pice of crap!...get your money back.....
Where there is no Iphone 5 charging pin included in the package? Or is the product not meant for iphone 5? I like using iphone 5,It's junk. Don't buy it.
What is the total cord length?,"approx. 100"" tip to tip"
"I need a Dell slim power adapter 90 watt for studio 1555, is this the correct replacement?",It works with my 1555 but it's not slim
is it compatible with dell original part number WK890,"Sorry, I don't remember what the model number was on the oringinal was."
is it replacement for original dell part number WK890,"Is your computer any of the laptops that is named in the part descriptions? If not, then this would be what you are looking for http://www.amazon.com/Dell-Original-Adapter-Notebook-Numbers/dp/B00EWAA0P4/ref=sr_1_8?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1396628291&sr=1-8&keywords=dell+WK890"
Does it have a 3-prong plug-in at the end?,Yes it does. Has a pretty long cord on it to
Does it charge the battery or just provide power for you to use the computer while it's plugged in only?,It charges the battery.
"Does this have a power cord that you can plug into an outlet? Judginig by the picture, it doesn't look like it so I just wanted to make sure. Thanks!",Yes. It has the battery and the cord.
DOES IT HAVE A POWER CORD FOR INSIDE,Yes
Will this hold an iPhone 5?,"yes, I upgraded to an iPhone 5 and I still use the stand. It sits centered with the new charging cable plugged in, and you can even use the stand with headphones plugged in even though Apple moved the jack to the bottom. (Stupid Apple) It just sits a little off to the right that way."
Will this stand work for an iPhone 6 plus and does it have any protective covering to prevent the aluminum from scratching furniture?,"Hi, I'm using this for my iPhone 6 Plus currently. I feel that it is able to support the phone in portrait position, as the metal stand itself is pretty solid. There are 4 rubber pads on the bottom of the stand so that serves as a form of protection and friction as well. The only grouch I have with this stand is that in portrait mode, the Lightning cable gets bent in an awkward position. Therefore, I normally charge it in landscape unless I really need it to be in portrait mode. Hope this helps :)"
Could be charged in a Moto X with a poestic slim case? Thanks.,"I think it could fit any phone and most small tablets. Nothing over 8-10"" probably."
iphone 5,"Yes-iPhone 5, With an Otterbox Defender case even."
can the iPad stand in portrait mode without falling ?,i don't think so. The lip on the stand is very slight and probably not enough to hold the weight of an iPad.
"Hello, Will this work with a Samsung NOTE 4 in a Tech 21 case?",Yes it should
Will it hold the latest iPod Touch?,"It depends I have an Ipod that both the ear phone jack and the computer/power connect are on the bottom so what I have done is turned it upside down. A little inconvenient but it works if you are crafty it would not take much to open the slot a little larger it is plenty wide. The unit it self is quite heavy for its size and you are not going to bend it without some real brute force. This is all good, it has real good rubber stoppers on the bottom and it does not move with a simple touch it has to be more of a real push. To give you an idea of the weight you would not want this to be dropped on your toe as it will really do some harm. Hope this helps."
Will this work with Moto G (1st Gen.)? With/Without case?,It's big enough and sturdy enough to work with my iPad. I hope that helps? I love it actually.
can i use a iphone 6 with it cause it looks like it will support it,"Yes, it is a generic part. It's also needs, so it can hold any phone."
Would this stand support an iPhone 6 Plus? Thanks!,I'm pretty sure it will since my ipad sits on there just fine.
Does these wireless keyboards work on all Dell computers,"With mine, they did. Nothing should prevent it from working."
"Are these new, refirbed or used?",New
Is this for a keyboard and mouse or for covers? I'm confused by your add title. Please clarify. Thanks,"I am not sure what you mean by ""covers"" but this was for a keyboard & mouse."
Will the Lenovo 0A33988 Slim USB Portable DVD Burner - Disk drive work with a Lenovo Y40?,I'm not sure. It works fine with my Lenovo T4XX laptop.
How does this work really?,"Plugs into the USB port. It is very light and therefore very portable. Apparently, you cannot use it to play DVDs which is why I bought it. Still looking into that one."
I have read some of the questions regarding this product but I'd like to know if it would play pc game disc such as Sims.,yes.
Does this work as a cd/dvd player for my lenovo x220?,"Yes, it works well. Kind of an inconvenience to have to use 2 usb ports but it works well."
Can this play DVD's?,"Yes. If you don't already have a program that plays them, this provides one that does it."
Does it work with Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro ? It has one USB port on each side.,"I have a Lenovo ThinkPad with one USB port on each side and it works just fine. It just requires that you use both of them so if you're using a mouse with the laptop, it will require that you choose between the mouse or the DVD drive. In my case, I only have to use the drive for a brief time each week and I can tolerate not having use of the mouse during that time."
What exactly is the necessary app?,No app.
Does it work with a Lenovo Ideapad Yoga11 running RT 8.1?,"Yes, that is what I am using. Be sure to get the necessary app."
Does this come with a cable to connect to an X1 Carbon?,yes.
Will it work with USB wired port of thinkpad T440S?,I do not no that - sorry - because I only have the X1 and the old X 301
Does the grip's shutter button work without a chord?,No. It doesn't. Even though is a great grip
will it fit a nikon d3100?,Yes
Does this grip have a remote sensor&gt;?,"Hi, no it does not, sorry. Fred C."
will it fit nikon 5200?,"No, it does't fit"
will this fit a nikon D3200,"Yes it does, i have a D3200 and works great, i suggest you buy another battery as this Grip holds 2"
how fast did it take for the people to get this ?,It usually takes 7-20 days to be delivered.
does it compactible with d 3200 ?,"yes, i bought this not to long ago, it works fine with mine."
Does the batter grip have a mount so you can screw it on to a tripod?,Yes. There is a threaded mount on the bottom identical to the standard mount on the camera.
Is this case easy to build in?,Yes!it is
Will the Corsair H110 (280mm) Radiator fit inside on the top of this case with an MSI ATX Motherboard mounted?,"I do not know, do not know the Corsair H110( 280mm) Radiator."
Would this graphics card fit with this case? http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B... Cheers,The case is huge. I can't see any card not fitting inside.
Does it support micro atx ?,Yes
Do these cameras work with the svat 503 all in system ?Thank you.,I do not know but the day time color is off.I left a review about them.
Do they work with the CV301-8CH-008 system...Need replacment cameras,I would think so.This what I know.I have the Clover Electronics CDR0880 Professional Grade 8-Channel DVR recorder.I am using 4 of wisecomm oc01775 cameras and 2 Svat High-Resolution Outdoor Night Vision Security Cameras (11002) which the day time color is off.Green grass is purple and brown coat is purple.Other colors also.I have 2 of Svat vu500c cameras that seem to have great day time color and night vision good. I know other people that mix other brand of cameras with there system. Tried wireless but did not work.So I would give it a try.You can always return them.
"How many cameras comes with the $149.99 price, 0ne or four?","4cameras, 4 mounting brackets ( shown on cameras), power supply with a 4-plug pigtail to power all 4 cameras, and 4 50-ft lengths of cable."
I had a couple quick power outages and now I can no longer get Netflix to stream. Is D-link the problem? I get Netflix on computer OK,You may need to disable Netflix in settings and then enable it that resets the account so you can log in again and it should work that's what I did after we had an outage
do you attach it to your computer? i.e. If I order something to stream online can I divert it from my computer screen to my television screen?,"This is a stand alone device. It does not connect to a computer. The D-link requires that you sing-in to the chosen service ie hulu, netflix and stream from there."
compatibility: does this work with older non HDTV?,"It has A/V output - composite video plus analog audio. If your TV has the red/white/yellow RCA jack input, it will work. Obviously, the image will only be as high a resolution as your set is capable (probably 480I) but it will work quite well. I don't know about playing local content. Probably not, or they would tout that feature. It seems most of these boxes anymore are just for streaming - manufacturers either assume nobody wants to watch their own movies anymore, or, more likely, the idea is to steer you toward (preferably PPV or subscription) streaming services."
wifi: Does this have wi-fi or strictly land-line?,"Yes. Mine works fine, but I had to press the WPS button on my router a few time. Once it connected I can move it to any room I want."
Work in Dominican Republic?,"If you have an internet connection it should. The power supply shipped with it is 110 VAC so if your voltage main is different, you will need the appropriate adapter. The frequency of the wireless connection may also be a problem if your government restricts certain bandwidth's and frequencies. But I think that you should have no problems."
Does anyone know if you can stream from a network attached drive? Currently have a D-link drive connected to a wireless router streaming via blueray.,"Nope. The only apps you can use are Netflix, YouTube, Vudu, and Pandora, and there's no USB port or Bluetooth."
Does anyone know how to attach the D-link movienite device to a current Youtube subscription?,"There is a menu item ""My YouTube"" go to that and sign in and it will give you a code you have to enter online but then it should link. Good luck"
why cant i get facebook,because it doesnot have Ie or any web browser to navigate.
does this support netflix profiles?,"Yes. When you open Netflix, it will show all of your profiles."
Do you need wifi to get the netflix,Yes
What is the mAh for this battery?,7.4v and 1500mah
Is this compatible with a Canon Rebel EOS XT?,"Yes there are. I have a Rebel EOS XT that I have had for a very long time. It's been in China, all around Europe, Africa, Austrialia, etc. I lent the Camera to my son on his trip to Jamaica and he left the battery and charger in the hotel. I order this one and it came quickly. It had two batteries and a travel charger. VERY GOOD BUY. I loved it. Good Luck"
What is the country of origin?,"All these items are Chinese. I'm not a fan of PRC stuff, but these have performed very well, and lasted for quite some time."
Are these batteries compatible with a cannon rebel xt eps 350 d?,No
My Optura camcorder has uses a NB-2LH battery. Is the NB-2L interchangeable with this?,"i replaced my nb-2lh battery and my grandsons changed his also and rthe work fine, this is a great buy also rufus ornduff"
What size are the screen protectors?,They are cut to fit the Samsung Galaxy Note Tablet. I guess they have them to fit all models.
Are these genuine canon batteries?,"They do not say canon, but I have had no problem with them. They are the off brand."
Is this compatible with Canon EOS Rebel T3?,Yes
I have a canon dc410. Are the batteries compatible?,"They are - The NB-2L batteries are rate at 530mAH and the NB-2LH are rated at 750mAH; so the ""standard"" capacity bty is going to provide less shooting time. The voltages are the same for both, however. I can't give you a direct ""this is how long this will last"" comparison, but in a high current-draw device (like a digital recorder) the 2L will probably last 1/2 to 2/3 as long as the 2LH. I can tell you that in my wife's Rebel XT these batteries have functioned very well."
Does the amount of charge remaining display on the camera? It seems that other off-brand batteries will NOT display that info.,"mark, The only battery that will display is the ones made by canon. Although other batteries can be used they will not show up on the display."
Is it able to charge in overseas,There's some kind of adapter for a European plug-in of some sort. Never used it before and not sure where too if that helps at all.
Does this plug into a regular outlet or just the car?,It plugs into a regular outlet
I have a Canon Optura XI and I just ordered this bundle. Now I realize it does not list my camcorder. Will these batteries work with an Optura XI?,"No way to know for sure until you receive the package. The original ""advertisement"" for this ""package"" should have indicated which camcorders these batteries will work on (i.e. the CANON VIXIA HF R11 & R10 I BELIEVE). I would anticipate that these batteries WILL NOT FIT, SO DON'T TEAR UP THE PACKAGE ANY MORE THAN YOU NEED TO! Once you've verified that the batteries don't work, get involved in the ""return/refund"" process. You might want to do this NOW, before actually receiving this package in the mail so you'll be able to act appropriately. I would not order any ""universal replacement pieces"" for any camcorder/camera, unless the original ""advertisement"" specifically mentions the parts will fit on your camcorder/camera model. If that information isn't there, the chances are BETTER THAT IT WON'T FIT/WORK, THAN THAT IT WILL. Hope this helps! Good Luck."
Will the original canon battery made by canon that came with the camera a hf r 10 charge on the replacement battery charger?,Yes it will do the charge. No issues with that. All of my batteries are genuine Canon brand.
do the batteries themselves work for a cannon vixia HF R10,"Yes, they fit perfectly, I bought 2 batteries NB-2L for my canon VIXIA HF R10, they are working pretty well, no problems so far."
Do these work with the Canon HF R20?,yes they do
What is the mAh rating on these? Thanks,im not sure but they work really good and charger dose to. was well wearth the money.
how to hook up surround sound,"Using RCA jacks, simply plug in the red and white males into the TV's ""Audio Out"" females in the rear of the TV, not in the side panel where you hook up gaming devices, etc. I then figured out through trial and error how to kill the internal speakers (look through the set-up menu from the ProScan remote and see if there's an audio control there). It may be as simple as moving the TV's volume to zero then only use the aftermarket sound systems volume controller. Good luck."
does proscan plcd5092A-D have internet connection,no it does not
Just went out any way to turn it . On,Do not follow. The question.
Refresh Rate? Amazon clams 120hz but manual states that it is only 60hz does anyone know what it is?,Amazon is wrong. Other sites has this @ 60. If you do a search on the LCD it will say 60Hz
can you enlarge the print for someone hard of seeing,yes
Does it have an external memory slot,"Yes, this is the older [black case] model. It is the newer [white case model] that has no external memory slot."
Can you turn the glowlight on and off? Thanks in advance for your feedback!,Yes
how long does the battery work if I use the glowlight?,"on the weekends, I read almost constantly and I always use the glow light ( I find it reduces the glare from the lamps in my house). It usually lasts for 30 hours or so."
Can passages be highlighted and can you write notes while using the Nook? Am looking at getting one for studying.,"Travis, Yes, you can. However, I think a tablet is better for taking notes and studying. The Barnes and Noble Android app also allows highlighting and taking notes and it's easier if you plan on doing a lot of studying. I have used my Nook to read study material as it's easier to carry around than a tablet, but for highlighting and note taking, it's not as efficient. It's more suited to the occasional note taking than for serious note taking during study."
What are the dimensions of the nook simple touch,"6.5 x 5.0 x 0.47 inches It is about the same height as a paperback, maybe a little bit wider, and a whole lot thinner."
Why can't I get a regular Kindle with light like BNs glow light-sheesh. basic: Is Kindle going to come out with something like this?,"You might want to take a chance on the Nook with Glowlight. It's not that expensive and it's a nice little device. The light makes a tremendous difference. I know there have been some negative reviews, but I have one and love it. It's much better than the clip on lights that are sold for unlighted e-readers. I just wanted a simple e-reader as well and I got one with a light. So I'm happy. The big difference is that you will need to buy books from B and N now, not Amazon. Remember, there will always be bad reviews when someone is dissatisfied; satisfied customers don't review as frequently. The worst that can happen is that you try it for the period that B and N allows for returns and don't like it: return it. Hope you find something you like."
kobo,"???? Are you advocating Kobo over this product? What? They are quite similar with small size, expandable memory that nothing else has any more, etc. Kobo comes next if I run out of Nook Simple Touch with Glowlight."
Can my books be saved off of my broken nook and put on a newly purchased nook?,"Your barnes and noble nook account is separate from the machine itself. So yes. if you log onto your new nook and put in your information from your nook account, all of your books should be there. The staff at b&n are very good about assisting with set up."
What is the size of the B&amp;N Simple touch w/glow light,"4 7/8"" x 3 5/8"" (122mm x 91mm) or, 6"" diagonally. I was happily surprise at the battery life even when using the glowlight extensively. The glowlight is adjustable over a range."
Will this fit my Macbook Pro 13.3 A1425?,"Yes, I believe so, as long as apple did not change to a front loading disk drive. I don't have the MacBook Pro, but my 13 inch Macbook fits perfectly. I get complements on my case all of the time."
will it fit a pro mid 2012?,"I'm not very good with apple models, it fits my laptop though and the model number for it is A1278"
Does any know if this will fit the 2011 (October) Mac Book Pro?,Yes it will. It is excellent by the way. I've had it a year and it looks new as the day I bought it
"Will this fit the (October 2011) Apple MacBook Pro 13.3"" MD313LL/A?","i have the newer 13.3"" pro with retina display and it's too big for it, im guessing it would be the same for yours"
"hi, can I use it for Sony VAIO Pro SVP13215PXB 13.3-Inch Core i7 Touchscreen Ultrabook? Thanks..","I have not tried the Sony Vaio with TopCase leather cover. So my answer is 'I don't know'. However if you could compare the dimensions of the macbook pro and the VAIO, you can figure it out yourself. I would say that the dimensions have to be pretty darn close between the two laptops (within 1-2 mm) to be able to fit it in usably. But for such a low price, what's the harm in trying it out and returning if it does not work? I have still not finished drooling at this beauty from different angles. What a perfect product!!!!"
is the case real leather or made to look like leather.,Made to look like leather. Its very convenient and I get lots of compliments with it but its definitely fake
Does this fit the Retina Display models?,Not sure but I think they are the same size.
does it fit A1278 model,Yes it does.
is it real leather,It's faux leather. Durable & well made.
Will this fit HP Split x2,"I am sorry, I am not able to answer your question. Good luck."
I bought this unit because I thought it was a stand-alone range extender. Do I absolutely need to buy a base unit to make it functional?,"Yes, you need what we call the base unit like (TP-LINK TL-PA211 AV200 Mini Powerline Adapter) . the base unit is the one you plug in the electricity outlet near your router and you connect it with the router by a RJ cable . after that you can plug the WPA281 (the one you already have it) in any electricity outlet in your home and you will have both Wifi signal plus a cable connection option."
If I add this to my existing TP Powerline Network can I set it up to extend my already existing Wi-Fi network [not TP] or does it add its own Wi-Fi?,It will create it's own seperate wi-fi network
Will this work with a TP-Link AV500 Nano Powerline Ethernet Adapter (TL-PA4010) or other TP adapters as a base unit?,Yes I'm using that combination right now. You'll just need to pair it after plugging it in.
"I have clear that it uses US plugs, but the specification, it stats 110V only or 110-240V range?",It stats 110-240V range. Hope this helps.
I have a TP-LINK TL-PA511 KIT Powerline Gigabit Adapter Starter Kit installed and it works great. Would this work with that model?,"It should, but it will likely slow your network speed down to 300mbps. This shouldn't be a problem unless you REALLY need your home network to run at 500mbps.. You'll note I said should.... TP-LINK USA has very responsive and informative email help staff. For a definitive answer, I suggest you contact them at this address. support.usa@tp-link.com"
Do these powerline adapters come with a NZ/AU AC adapter? Thanks in advance!,"No, no adapters for NZ/AU plugs. The powerline adapters have a US plug."
Can I pair this to a TL-PA2010KIT AV200 NANO?,"I don't believe so. You have a 200mbps non-wireless powerline network. The TL-WPA281 is a 300mbps wireless transmitter that is meant to be paired with a matching 300mbps ""base"" unit connected to the router. The one real drawback to this model is that it creates a completely separate wireless network in your house, with it's own addresses and password. It does not ""clone"" and seamlessly extend your existing wireless network. They have a model that does that, the TL-WPA4220KIT, but at the time I made my purchase, it wasn't available in the U.S. Your best bet is to contact TP-Link through their website http://www.tp-link.com/en/about/?categoryid=107 and ask them which wireless adapter would work with your existing equipment."
Can this be used with an existing ethernet-only Actiontec Powerline system?,"Depends on the speed of the Actiontec Powerline system. This is homeplug AV, if your Actiontec is 85 mb or slower it is Homeplug 1.0. HOmeplug 1.0 and homeplug AV are not very compatible though it MAY work, but it will be slow."
what is the difference between the TL-WPA281 an the TL-WPA281 KIT ?,"The kit comes with two units in it: TP-LINK TL-WPA281 KIT 300Mbps Wireless N Powerline Adapter Starter Kit, 2.4Ghz N300 Adapter + 200Mbps Adapter, 802.11b/g/n by TP-LINK. So you get the base unit and one extension, a really good deal as the extension unit is only an additional $18."
"Can I use this with a Mac? It says ""no configuration required"" but it came with a disc containing an app that is only Windows compatible. Help?","Yes you can. Have to use Safari. Google ""tp link setup on Mac"" and instructions are available. I used a PC, but it looks Mac doable to me."
Would it fit in the (NEWEST VERSION) Apple MacBook Air MD761LL/A 13.3-Inch Laptop?,It fits perfect on the air 13.3.
Is it made of real leather?,yes it is. at least it smells like it. I've had this product for a while and it has held up very well. I love it! Hope this helps you decide
Can it be made for the 11-inch?,"No, i think this is way too big for 11in. It's already a little loose for a 13in"
"I've the 13 inch Macbook Pro with retinal display, model A1425. Do you think it would work okay? Had problems with hard plastic cases not fitting.",It worked great for me.
is this made for the 13 inch WITHOUT retina display? or with retina display? i have the regular (not retina display).,It fits the non retina. It's also the one I use it with.
I noticed this doesn't have holes for ventilation. What's the maximum number of hours the MacBook Pro 13 A1278 can be used before removing this case?,"I never remove the case. It doesn't cover up any of the openings/slots in my MacBook Pro 13. As a result, I assume that it gets all of the ventilation it needs."
Would this fit the MacBook Pro 13 Model A1278?,Yes it does. That's my model as well. It doesn't slip off or slide around. It makes it look like a huge iPad case. I love mine but the only issue is the magnetic closure tab. Basic wear and tear from folding. So just be aware of that.
would this fit the hp pavilion x360? 13.3 inch screen? it also folds into a tablet,"I'm only the buyer not the person that sales this product. I would try to help but I am also not a hp pavilion x360 13.3' screen holder. anyways, happy late holidays and hope you have an awesome 2015"
"Has anyone had problems with their computer since buying this case because of the magnetic strap? I have a Macbook Air ""13""",What magnetic strip? There is no magnetic strip that I use with my case.
"Will this fit a Macbook Pro 13"" if you don't know the model #? Gift for someone else and don't have the model #",Yes I have the same model !
"This model is compatible with the steering wheel control car Hyundai Sonata 2006, I change the stereo with steering wheel controls?",Yes buy you will need this additional part: PAC SWI-RC
"the wires in my car wont fit in the back of the unit, do i need to rewire or is there an adapter?","You will never see any harness from the vehicle plug directly in to an aftermarket head unit. The head unit should have come with a new harness, but before you cut any wires, you will want to look into a harness adapter specific to your vehicle. This will help you avoid cutting any stock wires, but you will have to solder or crimp the new adapter to the harness that came with your head unit."
Is there av plugs in rear for my amplifier,It only has one set.
is it compatiable with android,"Yes, anything with Bluetooth should work fine"
Wire harness.2000 toyota 4ru ner,That is not a question. But yes your 2000 4runner would require the adaptor for that make and model. Aftermarket radios do not plug in to your car without an adaptor for your model/year. Try using a ? At the end of your sentence.
"Do you know if this unit fits my camry 2006?, Do I need to buy additional wires/equipment?",More than likely you'll need the kit
Does this unit fit in a 1993 Nissan 300ZX?,As long as the location will fit a double DIN unit. You'll also want to order an installation kit for your car. This will fill in any gaps and include any clips that will make the install easier. Don't forget the wiring harness as well.
Is this receiver compatible with a Ford SHAKER 1000 system?,Only if you buy the right wiring harness
"My japanese made 2006 Yaris has a stereo measuring 8""widex4""long. Does anyone now if that one would fit my car?, thanks!",I would use go to crutchfield or another online retailer who will tell you what fits your vehicle.
Does it have a MUTE button?,No
"I have a Technics SL-B3 turntable that has a spot for the belt that is 7 3/4"" in diameter and 24 1/2' in circumference. Is this the right one ?",Mine is SL-B2 and fits perfectly
I have a Technics SL-B100. will this belt fit,"It most likely will. It's been a while since I had to deal with this problem, but if you want to get your turntable working, the cost is reasonable and worth giving it a try. If you have a problem installing this, type your question on Google and a video should come up with very clear instructions."
Hi. Do you know if this fits a Pioneer Turntable Model PL 512?,"Not sure! Technics is made by Panasonic, so I thought this one would work and it did. Might want to look up Pioneer's website and get the belt #. Good luck!"
wil this belt fit a technics b300 turntable? Can I buy an electric chord also?,I don't know if it fits all technics turntables. Try it. It's not expensive. What's an electric chord?
need belt for SL220 will this fit?,"Not positive. I tried it on a long shot for my older SL - BD2 and it was perfect. I think it's safe to assume they used a standard belt size for all of those older models, but not positive for sure."
Will this fit a Technics SL-B10?,"It fits my SL-B24. The place where you put the belt on the SL-B24 measures 7 3/4 inches, so if your turntable has that same measure it should be safe to buy this belt. I've added some pictures on the product page."
does it fit a technics sl bd2 turntable?,Yes It Will
Will this belt fit an SL-B2?,yes this belt worked exactly as the original belt ..glad we found it here
Do you know if this fits a Tecnicc SL-BD1?,No
does this belt fit the technics sl-i25 turntable?,Yes
This or turtle beach xp510 ? Is there differences between these two headsets?,Hardware wise they are the same. Looks and Audio presets are slightly different.
hi this work on mobile ? plz i need fast answer ^^ ty,"Yes, you can use Bluetooth or a cocorthst come with"
my son has connected and the audio works but they mic wont work it is giving him an error code of 8001009,"Kim, Joshua has the best advice and have your son or you follow his instructions. If all fails contact Amazon and let them know the problem and you can get an replacement right away!"
Can I use another power source is the usb cable ? i mean use Power adapter supply ? plz fast answer ^^,"The Transmitter uses a DC 5v input for power. The USB is used to recharge the battery in the headset, and it is the only way to recharge it that I am aware of. Can you explain your concerns regarding the USB recharging cable?"
"I have the Headset Adapter that came with another set of Turtle Beach headphones, can I plug these into that for my Xbox One?",I don't know what type of adapter you would need. The Xbox One has digital audio out (optical) that will plug directly into the base station of this headphone setup.
Can I use this on PS4,"I don't see why not. It has analog (yellow RCA) plug and digital (optical) plug. I have the TV optical passing thru to the stereo so anything plugged into my TV (DVR, XBOX, DVD) plays thru the headphones without the stereo on."
For PC Users do i need to buy a bluetooth adapter? or can this connect into plain USB? I have evga x58 3-way classified board (which is a usb 2.0),Yes you will need a Bluetooth adapter for your PC.
Will this Headset work with Xbox One if I have the Microsoft headset adapter? I already have the adapter so it wouldn't be a problem.,yes it should work! i use mine with xbox one but without the adapter.
Is the microphone detachable?,No
"Will these work with the new Xbox E console, since the ""E"" does not have an optical connection?","Yes, unfortunately the E does not have an optical port, so we made a special adapter to use our digital surround sound headsets with the Xbox 360 E. You can only purchase it at our website ... http://www.turtlebeach.com/product-detail/audio-converter-parts/ear-force-hd-audio-converter/421"
i can't get any tv reception at all i keep pushing the scan button like it says for about 15 minutes and not a thing happens. help!!,"be sure the transmitter is on and not real high off the floor, i put mine at the base of the tv. the range is enough you hear it in the next room but pushing that middle button 'once"" and wait and see if you hear the dialog and if not push it again."
"once installed does this product ""cut out / disable"" the tv speakers? can the tv sound still be heard by others in the room at a different volume leve",I put my TV on mute to hear thru the wireless headset. Works fine.
can your replace the batteries in the headphones,yes very easy
"I can't get it to go from radio to the tv, what do I do?",Push down or Flickr the. Radio button until Youvhear the tv
Does this headset come with the warranty even though it is not purchased directly from TB?,"I don't remember seeing anything about a warranty in the box, but I have used mine almost everyday since I bought it and not once have I had any issues with it. Turtle Beach makes really good products, I have three of there headsets and not one has had any issues. I would just register it through the website and if you have any problems contact them about it, I have heard really good things about there customer support."
Has anyone tried using more than one of these in the same room/area? I'm wondering if its possible to daisy chain two together.,Not 100% sure but they are dual band so its possible it would work.
My PS3 has a DAC to my home theater for SurroundSound and an HDMI to my TV for normal sound at night. How do I pair these to get the SurroundSound,"The wireless transmitter will pass through digital optical -- it has both an in and out port for optical -- so you should be able to daisy-chain, plugging the transmitter into the PS3, and the DAC into the transmitter."
Are these compatible with the Xbox one,"Yes, but you need the Xbox One chat adapter."
"Can anyone get this to work on Linux? Output is mono, via pulseaudio; in chats, the other person hears their voice echo.",No. This is a gaming headset.. It's engineered only for games. The sound quality and its chat quality in playstation and Xbox is unbeatable but don't expect it to give you the same results via any other media source
can i hear the game and the people in a xbox party?,"No, I would not recommend these particular TB's..."
I want to buy it to Portugal. Can you sell it?,no sorry
does it work for xbox360,"Yes, works in mine just fine"
is it compatible with the ps4,Yes
does it work on PC/Mac? and is this wireless?,Don't know I had bad experience with them
Some reviews are saying that they have to power set to max and still have a hard time getting light to bounce. Is there a way around that?,"the light dosent spread like they show in the commercial, it dosent do a lot different then without."
Will it work on the SB-700?,"I have a Sony HVL-F58AM. I have used the ""Wing"" on it and it worked very well. You will have no problem using it in your Nikon flash. I could affirm that it could work actually in any flash. It mounts like a ""hat"" on top of your flash. The wing is just a light diffuser. I am happy with it. But there are lots of light diffusers for flashes. You will know if you like it or not if you try it. Just like everything in photography. Buy and try trials !!! Another thought is that you can enter its name in Youtube and you will see a nice tutorial about it. I came to learn about this diffuder in Youtube. Try to watch its video."
Hi I have a canon 320Ex will it fit that? because I really want this thing!,"This device uses a Velcro strap to size to the flash. A Canon 320x has a sloping head on it, so at most you may need a little Velcro tape on the head of the flash to insure it does not slip. I have used this on may flashes and it works well on everything I tried it on."
"Does it work on any Yongnuo flashes, especially YN560 series?","Yes, it uses a Velcro strap to adjust the size and it really should work with any rectangular flash unit."
"If I order this from Amazon, will I get the 2nd gen standard package or the older one? thanks!","I have no idea whatsoever. I only bought one, I don't make them! By the way, mine is probably the original model but it's absolutely brilliant!"
How well does this work with a Nikon SB-700?,"It works really well that all I use it with. The only problem is occasionally the wings fall off but only a problem if someone bumps you. It's not very good in a crowded club, unless you have a tripod and a corner. I really like this product it's just so nice for portraits. I hope this helps ."
what is wings made from? (paper or plastic). Thanks,Durable Plastic
"Will this work on a Canon Rebel t3? I don't have an external flash, so can it attach on camera's pop up flash?",It's made for an external flash only. I'm sure you could probably rig it to your camera.
"Dear Seller, could you send this item to UK ?",We ship world wide.
"My kids are regular users of Netflix, Hulu, and Youtube. Are these able to be used on this tablet?",Yes to Hulu and Netflix. Although I have experienced that with Youtube. Whether parental controls are turned off or not Youtube can not be accessed.
Can I download movies from my kindle account to my kurio,Kurio: worst tablet ever
I'm concerned about just 4 GB. Is this a problem?,The memory was never a problem. It was how the whole thing functioned. It was horrible even for an adult.
I downloaded Netflix from the Amazon store. I get sound but no video. Tried uninstalling app &amp; reinstalling already. Didn't help. Any ideas? Kurio 7s,i am having the same problem! i knew i should've stuck with apple.

Can you download the game(despicable me minion rush) on the kurio 7 for my grandsos,Yes. As long as you have your device connected to your Gmail account which will allow you to find the game on Google Play. Or use the following link and sign in using your Gmail account.

How can I download Netflix onto my Kurio 4s?,"""Purchase"" the app on the amazon app store. It is a FREE app. :-)"
Can my child send and receive text messages from his kurio touch ?? If so how !?,"Yes you can download text me free texting and call ,and you can block calling too,available in most app stores. Hope this helps"
how do you download the amazon store app to purchase apps?,Download it to your pc and connect your tablet to your pic and sync them. You can actually download it from the amazon page they have a link.
Where is it made? Japan or China?,Mine is made in Japan
"Hi guys, can i change the lens on this camera?",No.

"Is there a difference between RX100 and RX100/B? What does the ""B"" indicate?",The B stands for the color in the product; in this case Black
How exactly does the Lumix LX7K compare with the Sony RX100?,"Short version.... bigger sensor on the rx100 (better picture quality) versus faster/wider lenses on the lx7 (better low light performance and a more versatile zoom). Both are great cameras, if budget is not a problem go with the rx100. If you go otherwise with the lx7 you will get better Low light performance and a more versatile lenses for your money. Never the less... both are awesome cameras."
"I bought this camera a few weeks ago and want to connect it to an iPad to transfer photos, is this possible?","Yes it is without going thru a computer. I bought the Apple SD card adapter for the iPad, hooked it up to the iPad, took the SD card out of he camera, put it into the adapter and after a wait, depending on the photos in your SD card - the photos loaded into my iPad. It was great as I was able to view the photos that I took everyday that eveneing while I was on holiday."
I'm very disappointed that a camera this sophistocated doesn't include a user's manual.,Came from and amazon review: ADVANCED guide for RX100 for use online with working search function: http://esupport.sony.com/docs/dvimag/DSCRX100_guide/en/contents/02/index.html DOWNLOADABLE PDF of Advanced Guide (but search function doesn't work on this small PDF) - available here: - http://www.datafilehost.com/download-a9ef796a.html
"Has anyone found a good, fingerprint proof screen protector for this camera? Ive only used ScreenPatronus in the past and have wondered about Clarivue","My opinion will be controversial, but I'll offer it anyway :) I've come to believe it makes no sense to pay a premium price for a high resolution screen and then cover it with optically inferior plastic. This is like investing big bucks in a beautiful sofa and then covering it with a sheet to protect it from those who might actually sit on it. I used to slap screen protectors on everything. Now I don't use them with anything. Protectors may have been useful when screens weren't very sharp or durable. But screen and glass technology has advanced greatly, making screen protectors unnecessary and even undesirable on modern devices. Unnecessary , because the tempered glass used on most screens these days is highly scratch resistant. Undesirable, because even the best screen protector degrades the underlying image more than do the micro-scratches that inevitably accumulate on any glass surface that's actively used. Screen protectors degrade faster and more noticeably with use, and dust or air bubbles become more pronounced. Transparency diminishes as the material absorbs and reacts to skin oil. Yet few replace their degrading screen protectors. Most of us just put up with the deteriorating clarity until we buy a new device. My advice: Don't downgrade your high-res screen with a plastic overlay that offers scant protection over what the raw glass itself can provide. Just be reasonably careful with your device, and enjoy all the clarity and resolution you paid for. Keep a microfiber cloth handy to wipe off fingerprints. One caveat: tempered glass is very tough -- until you damage it. You may breathe a sigh of relief after inspecting your device following an accidental drop, thinking nothing was damaged. And you may be less careful in the future, thinking your device is tougher than you thought. This would be a mistake. The shock of that first drop may have caused microscopic fractures in the crystalline structure of the glass that will make it more vulnerable to breakage later. Think of them as invisible fault lines. That's why, if you've ever dropped your phone or camera on a hard surface, or significantly scratched the glass, you should be more careful with it afterward, not less. Whether you can see it or not, the glass will be more brittle and susceptible to shattering on a subsequent, milder drop."
where is the ok button on this product? when I put the sd card in the screen asked if I wanted to format it. said to press ok button. don't know which button it means.,the power button is the ok button
need battery,"Sorry, but I have no idea of where you can get a battery for this unit. My suggestion is to take the battery out and go to a battery expert and ask them. Or take the whole unit to a battery expert shop."

Also no instruction book where can download one?",I have been using it for a long time now and haven't had a reason to view the video. It worked good during the first few weeks. The book is on the camera internal memory you have to hook it to a computer with a USB cable like a camera or phone.
are there any firmware updates for this device?,Don't know about any firmware updates as mine has been working just fine for 4 months. It was not easy to understand the menu structure at first as there are 2 modes for the menu that offer different settings. It does excellent video quality although the sound is weak. This is a good buy for the money.
"The camera has three loop settings, does each loop change the file name or over writes the previous file?",IT HAS POOR QUALITY SO I RETURN THAT

The item I received did NOT have the HDMI port. Is the picture shown not the item you ship to people?,"Looking at the front of the unit, the hdmi port is under a cover on the right side. It is right next to the power input."
"WHERE ENGLISH MANUAL, I CAN'T READ F.. CHINESE L .","Hi, this is Gary Davis. I also received one of these---sort of cool! Anyway, you should be able to open the instruction completely as one long page. The English version is included on the reverse side. If this doesn't do it, let me know through Amazon, and I will email you a copy. Just need your email address if English is not on back (rem: You need to unfold completely to get English on one side and Chinese on the other). Hope I hve helped. Gary"

Would someone comment on USB hard drive capabilties of this router? Can a usb hard drive be used as a network drive? Is it easy to set up?,"BE CAREFUL! this router DOES NOT support 3T hard drives, since it only works with MBR partitions, and HDs with over 2T are GPT. Im having this problem with my WD 3T external HD, and im trying to contact TP, to see if there is any alternative to partitioning MBR (id loose about 1T of disk space thus transforming a 3T HD into 2T) Hope this helps"
Can I use a second wireless router in the same area without interference? Already have a Cisco WRT120N connected to wired system as access point.,"Use channels 1, 6, or 12 to avoid overlap on the wireless-G 2.4 Ghz range. Most devices still don't utilize the wireless-a 5 GHz range. I am a network engineer BTW."
Which is better buy the tp n750 or newer model tp c7,"From what I'm reading TP-Link C7 has 3 internal antennas for 2.4 Ghz frequence (the 3 external antennas in it are for 5 Ghz only). While N750 shares its external antennas for the two frequencies, which I think is much better since it would cover a wider range."
Is it ipv6 ready?,"Yes. See TP-Link page, http://www.tp-link.us/article/?faqid=482"
Can I put a hosts file on it so I don't have to put one on each individual computer?,"Yes, provided you have flashed the TP-WDR4300 firmware from it's stock version (1.7 is the most current) to the appropriate corresponding DD-WRT bin file (firmware). Make certain to refer the DD-WRT build and it matches exactly to the boiler plate version label on the router. This router does support DNSmsq, with that you will need to write a script ""hosts"" file. No need to to go back to each individual computer. This should block unwanted ads from any specific site. Reseacrh DD-WRT, OPENwrt, Tomato and etc...Good Luck."
"I have another router on the network. With the factory firmware, can I disable WAN and DHCP server on this? Because I want the other router tohostonly","Yes, it's actually pretty easy with one caveat: when you change the IP or mask on the LAN settings tab for the router, you need to be sure everything else is where it needs to be. For all the other settings tabs, you can click Save and it'll tell you that you need to reboot to apply settings. But change the IP or mask on the LAN settings tab and you'll be forced to reboot. Also, if you're just setting this up like I did as the wireless component of an existing wired network (I have a D-link handling primary router duties and am using this for the wireless functionality alone), you'll want to just ignore the WAN setup (and the WAN port on the back). Just plug into one of the 4 main LAN ports and connect that to your existing router, disable DHCP and set the IP address under the LAN settings for the router with the appropriate mask. Once you're forced to reboot the device, you'll just connect via your browser to that IP address you set. In my setup I picked an IP and set it up as a reserved IP for that device in my existing router to avoid conflicts (say after a power outage). After that you can set up anything else (wireless, etc.) unless you already did that before the reboot. Found this documentation: http://www.tp-link.com/en/article/?faqid=417 Also if you want to use it to extend an existing wireless network via WDS: http://www.tp-link.com/en/article/?faqid=440"

Can I use this to send my roku and my blue ray to the tv,"My experience with this item is no. It does NOT work with Blu Ray players because of the HDCP, the copy protection that most Blu Ray Discs have. I'm not familiar with Roku.. You need a hdmi splitter with HDCP pass thru. Try B&H online out of New York."

Is there an image available with the checks removed so it can work on the Mygica510B boxes?,"If you purchase my unit I will inform you about the procedure to flash the xios ds firmware with image files, however you would probably need to do your own community research once you have the item. This is the only unit I have and I am not a software dev at that company."

How deep is the side pocket?,"Writeman, the pocket is 5.5"" deep and ~9"" wide. With my iPad and attached keyboard in the case the pocket easily accommodates one regular pen, stylus pen, headphones, USB charge/sync cord, and several business cards. If I have any papers I do not want to get wrinkled, I put them in the main pocket next to the iPad. It would accommodate a phone (if the phone is not in a thick case like an otterbox) as the picture shows, but I carry my phone on my belt."
Will an Ipad Air 2 with the Griffin Survivor Slim Case fit in this sleeve?,"Anna I have no idea the size of the Air 2 with the Griffin Survivor Slim Case.

Would it fit an ipad 4 with attached keyboard?,No
Would this hold an ipad and kindle OK?,Yes
"Would an Apple keyboard fit in one of the side pockets? I'd like to put my iPad Air 2 inside, and the keyboard in a separate pocket.",No
Will this fit an ipad air with keyboard case?,"I have a Trent Airbender hardshell case on my ipad 4th gen. It will fit length, but not height...too big by about 1/2 inch .. I would suspect if your ipad is the same size of a 4th gen but thinner and your keyboard has a spine on it, it won't fit because it is just about 1/2 inch too short in height. If I didn't have the keyboard/hardshell attached it would fit just fine - very snug no room for anything else."
Is it USB bootable?,Yes
Does it have one-key-restore feature?,"NO and it is a very bad investment. Within one month the mouse pad stopped working, then about 5 months later the keyboard stopped working. I cannot give a good review but I hope this helps!"

where it made this laptop,"Is made in China as most electronics are, It says so in the laptop itself and on the user manual."

You can do it on the ""Device Manager"" level (if you want it permanently off) or at the trackpad driver level - then it will be off only when you have an external HID (i.e. mouse) plugged in. However, after a while you get used to it, actually, and it becomes borderline workable."

Vizio Laptops: Who knows??,Was this a question or a stupid plug for Apple products? If you want to know the quality of the parts they use then look for the breakdown on iFixit and they will tell you exactly who makes each part.

Dark enough that it is hard to make out text in a bright room?","Yes, like most other computers nowadays, you can turn the brighest low enough that the screen turns off. It this ""bright room"" of yours is equal to a really hot sunny summer day than it might be hard to see but thats different so i think itll be alright. This computer is definitely worth it."

How do you load games onto the computor?,"You can buy an external CD/DVD drive($25 and up), convert the game to an ISO image and installed using a USB device, download to a USB drive.

What is a comfortable viewing distance to the screen -- being that it is so huge? Is 2' too close (small desk)? And 7' (nearest wall) too far away?,"I view it from about 2 1/2 feet, but it depends on whether you are focusing on the entire screen, or just a part of it. For example, I use Google Drive, and the documents take up only a part of the screen. Sometimes I lean closer to look at small print. However, if you are using the screen to view movies, I would back up a foot. 7 feet would be too far for me."
Is the screen an anti-glare screen?,I would say no...but that has not been a problem for me. I still love this computer!
Assume HD 2500 is default graphics card. Is there a way to change to NVIDIA GT640M graphics?,I haven't the slightest clue. What has Asus said?
Does this come with the subwoofer?,"Yes It does. But I just setup my PC last night and didn't plug it in. I've heard it's not that good. We'll see.

"How to make this thing quiet? It is not like huge noise, but this irritating sound is a headache to me.","It does not have a hard drive. Mine is very quiet. The only part that would make any sound is the fan. I Googled ""ct14-ao fan noise"" and it led me to Google for ""Vizio CT15-A1 Fan Issue"" and it takes me to another entry in that same forum.notebookreview.com forum and the 5th response offers a quick fix, to go to control panel&gt;power options&gt;change plan settings&gt;change advanced plan settings and change the maximum state to under 100% to inhibit the cpu turbo mode. Even though the CT14 does not have Turbo mode, slowing down the CPU will keep it from generating so much heat and should make the fan from running so fast or so often."
"Does this utilize EFI or BIOS? I'm thinking BIOS because of it's age, and Win7, but i want to run Linux instead of Windows.","You can boot into the familiar blue on gray American Megatrends (2011) BIOS (some variation or other of which I've been using for the past 25 years or so lol) by hitting the F2 key when the Vizio graphic displays on power-up (hitting the DEL key gets you to a DOS level boot options screen, where you see a Windows 7 choice, and at which point you can also choose to go into the more traditional F8 boot options if you wish ...like Safe Boot, for example). Interestingly though, in the BIOS boot option section, there's a UEFI boot choice, I'd never noticed before. So, I reset Boot Option 1 to UEFI, restarted ...and all that you could do - still - was go into BIOS, go to the boot option choice screen, or go directly to the Windows start up screen. So. No pretty UEFI to play with. Great question though."
Can the 128SSD drive be replaced? Henry,"Yes, you should be able to replace the drive."

"The keyboard on this machine does not have ""Page up"", ""Page down"", ""Home"", and ""End"" keys. Are there alternate key strokes/shortcuts to replace the function of these keys?","Yes. Use the Fn key in combo with the arrow keys. &lt;Fn + Left&gt; = Home &lt;Fn + Right&gt; = End &lt;Fn + Up&gt; = Page Up &lt;Fn + Down&gt; = Page Down ...good question. I more-or-less stumbled across that lol (actually, I think it's pretty standard for smaller laptops with keyboards sans those keys, but I'd long ago forgotten)."
how difficult is it to type on?,"The keyboard is very low profile and the spacing is a little different than other keyboards. Took some time getting used to but I love it now, typing on a regular keyboard now seems to take more effort. Another thing to consider though is that the keyboard does not have a backlight which I have often found inconvenient"
"I cannot find another power cord/adapter for my Vizio CT14-A4, and Vizio doesn't sell them. The plug is a small, strange size for a laptop. Help? I bought one in early Feb. 2013 from a seller on Ebay who actually advertised his as being for my laptop,...",http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_trksid=p5197.m570.l1313&_nkw=vizio+adapter&_sacat=0&_from=R40
$150 more now than just a couple of days ago? No thanks.,"I agree..... price increase is not justifiable, considering the keyboard design."
is there a special $15 upgrade to W8????,"Yes, there is. http://store.vizio.com/ct14a0.html#support"
Does it have a HDMI port?,Yes.
My power supply died. Does anyone know where I might be able to get one. I called Vizio and they said it is on back order. I have looked online. Thank,"Hi Hanna... I'm not from US therefore if the same will happen with mine Visio, i will be unable to find the replacement... However, it's not difficult to find out the power supply parameters (volts, ampers) and to purchase another power supply with the same voltage rate and the same or higher ampers rate. Then you can just take the stock power cable and connect new power supply with it. Kind regards Evgeny"
Can I add a second monitor to this?,Yes there are USB ports and we were able to add a 2nd monitor this way
can you receive tv programs?,"It has HDMI inputs, and you can switch the mode back and forth between PC viewing and TV viewing (or anything else that can connect to it via HDMI). So, yes, with some sort of a TV receiver (dish, etc) you can watch TV. This is a great computer. Its fast, the screen is crystal clear. The keyboard and mouse that come with it are terrible, all you need to do i purchase a USB mouse and keyboard."
"Are others having the same trouble with drivers that I am? I've been on the phone with Vizio and MS a total of 8 hours, &amp; returned 1st machine.",I am sorry to hear of your troubles however I have had nothing go wrong with my computer thus far. Good luck
I don't see info on the disk drive for this computer. Is it DVDRW? what speed?,"If you are asking about optical media, there is no CD or DVD drive, so you have to get an external one. The hybrid 1TB disk is OK; not as good as a true SSD but it boots pretty fast. Windows Performance Information gives it a disk data transfer rate score of 5.9, and that's the lowest subscore, so that determines the overall 5.9 score for the computer. Not sure if that scoring mechanism is really fair for hybrid drives though."
Can I get a proforma invoice for this computer,"Yes, Vizio will give you one if you request it on their website."
does this unit play through a speaker also&gt;,"I'd never given any thought to this until receiving your question. The unit only has a socket for the mini-plug as is used for headphones. I just tried plugging in a desktop speaker from a ""all in one"" type unit (w/radio/cassette/CD) and it played just fine - BUT keep in mind that only one speaker can be played thru it, and even if you use a ""Y"" adaptor it'll still come out mono. So the short answer is Yes, with limitations."
I'm looking for a unit just to play my old cassettes again...is this unit what I'm looking for?,it broke when I opened it so I was never able to use it.
"Is it powered by batteries only, or is there a jack for a wall adapter or DC power?",Batteries only.
is it reversable,"No -- you have to flip the cassette over. For the price, I guess it's all right, but really this is a pretty terrible piece of equipment. (Very cheaply made.)"
does the player have auto reverse?????????????????????,No. It just has Fast forward
Does this include the headphones in the picture?,"Yes, it did -- they were about the same quality as the player. . . ."
does it have a built in speaker,No
This camera can be installed in the rear bumper ?,"yes, but you need to run wires, I installed at the top of rear license tag, where there are already wires for lights and no extra holes..."
Do you view what the camera sees on your GPS?,"Well, if you mean the in-dash radio that also functions as a GPS, then yes. If you mean a standalone gps, then no. In order to ensure compatibility, check to make sure that your factory or aftermarket radio has an RCA video input jack. More likely than not any aftermarket radio with display will have one, but often times factory radios are a bit more tricky."
will this camera be compatible with a WIFI sending unit or a wireless sending unit?,"I assume you're talking about some sort of system to wirelessly transmit the video from the back to the front of the car. I can't say for sure without knowing the unit, but if it has a ""composite"" video input, there's no reason it should not work with this camera. Other than supplying power to the transmitter, receiver, and camera, you just have to be sure the car has a way to sense when it's in ""reverse""."
I've had this for 10 months. It got foggy 1 week ago and it wouldn't clear up. The weather is very dry and hot here in California. Can you fix this?,Did you try cleaning the lens. Try a Q-Tip and some alcohol. See it that works.
What is the voltage for this camera? Will it work to replace the factory camera in my 2004 toyota 4runner with jbl and nav?,This camera most certainly required 12v. Most vehicle harnesses use 12v also but some use 6v. Just google to verify it uses 12v as well and that it uses the same connection type. Some vehicles have camera harnesses that are not the typical RCA. In that case you could always patch the power to your reverse light (also 12v) and the video signal patched into your factory harness to get it to your radio.
How do I remove the mirror image to use the camera on the front?,"Unfortunately this camera is fixed in mirror mode. There are some that include an additional wire that can be used to select non-mirror mode but not this model. However if you buy a made-for-cars monitor display you may find the monitor can be configured to switch the image, in which case the picture reverts the normal. After trying maybe a dozen different made-for-car cameras I gave up and bought an HD camera like the Go Pro. This gave a much more satisfactory picture under a wider range of condition. This particular camera failed after six hours of use."
"greetings, this camera sive pair pioneer ael Radio app? thanks","I am sorry, but I cannot answer your question."
"How does this camera do at night. I noticed there was an IR camera made by them to, any difference?","In the dark, the backup lights on my car provide enough light to see reasonably well about 10 ft. behind the vehicle although the picture is grainy. Bright lights, e.g. overhead lights at gas pumps, tend to wash out the image. I don't know anything about the IR unit."
Will this work on JVC KD-NXD505A?,Yes it will
What would cause this to flicker so badly (as stated in my review)? Goes from light to dark quickly. Bad Connection?,Excellent in the dark to now there is no any defects or feedback
"If this is so good,why do I need 3?",it's simple ..many people will screw up the first time or the second time trying to install it..then you have a third chance..that's why they send you 3...personally mine was installed succesfully the first time..i sold one to a friend...and i keep one for in case i needed...but until now the one i install looks very good!!
Do these screen protectors make it easier to see your screen in the sunlight?,"Not really...Can't say if it diminished screen brightness under direct sunlight, but it definitely doesn't improve viewing under sunlight. I think even w/out the screen protector, one will have trouble viewing the screen under direct light."
Is this anti-glare? The screen protector I got with my phone has so much glare I can't read my phone outside with my sunglasses on.,It does not seem to be anti glare to me.
Are these matte? I don't want them matte. Please let me know.,They are not matte. I didn't want matte either. They are very clear.
*is this case completely clear or does it look a bit hazy? Is it better than Zagg?,The Screen Protectors are very clear. Zagg has not impressed me personally. In my books Tech Armor is better.
"Hi, there are some scratches on my screen protector, does the warranty cover this? If so, how can I get it replaced?","I had scratches on my protector as well, and when I contacted the company (Tech Armor) they were happy to send me replacements."
Did anyone have difficulty getting the top and bottom corners to stay down on the screen? I had to cut those corners off the first one 8 months ago...,"I had a problem with a corner. But I thought I must have accidentally touched it and that's why it didn't stick. Tech Armor is sending me more, to replace that one and another one I messed up. Maybe this batch will be better."
does this product fit the SGH-I747 model ?,"I don't know, I put it on a galaxy s3."
Does it block out the blue light and UV light?,Yes it does
How does the lifetime warranty work?,"Good Question.. I still have the pouch packet that it came in, and I see nothing that says anything about the warranty other than the stamped logo on the front. They do have a small pamphlet enclosed with a ""Thank you for your purchase"" section, and it simply reads...and I quote ""If you have any issues with this product or our service please contact us, we are here to help! Before contacting the retailer or posting negative feedback, please email us at customerservice@techarmor.com and we will promptly work with you to resolve your issue, provide replacement product, or even facilitate a return."" Sorry, but this is all I could find."
Does it have a backlit feature?,No only the device buttons light. It is the same controller that comes with the hopper
Is this remote a learning remote such that it can learn individual buttons from another remote control? Has anyone done this (for this model)?,"Yes it is. I have not done it, but it does have the window on the side where you ""shoot"" codes into it."
will this remote work with the main TV with the Hopper along with the other remote?,Yes
how do you pair 40.0 remote control for hopper/joey receivers?,If you have another 'paired' remote: use it to go to settings...handheld remotes then press a button on the 'new' remote. (I think it's the input or select button) If you do not have another 'paired' remote: open the front of the Hopper/Joey...one of the buttons puts it into pairing mode which will also put all the information you need on the screen...follow the directions on the screen. This works whether you have a 'paired' remote or not.
"I was told that remote for the Hopper receiver is not the same as remote for a Joey. Is this so? If so, is this item a Hopper remote or Joey remote?",They are one and the same and this works for both. I have the original hopper and joeys.
I just got one of these remotes. It does not control the hopper. does it have to be activated?,You have to program it to your hopper. You can look up how online if you don't have the manual
how do you program this remote to operate tv 2? Or is this one specifically supposed to be for tv 2 since it has UHF?,"There are three ways: * Scanning the Remote Database * Entering a Code * Learning Codes These are covered in the Remote Users Guide it should come with the new remote or dig out the one that came with the Hopper. If you can't find them, you can go to the Dish web site and download it before you buy. Pretty straight forward. I use one Hopper with two remotes one for me and one for my wife, that way I'm not always looking for the remote. I also have two Joeys with remotes in other rooms."
can 2 of these be paired to the hopper at the same time?,Yes. We do in our living room.
Will the Dish 40.0 remote control work on non-Hopper Dish Receivers? I have the ViP722 which uses IR/UHF remote controls.,"No, the 40.0 remote will only work the Hopper and Joey. For the 722 you need the 21.0 remote which is available at this time from Amazon."
Just got hopper/joey set-up. is this remote for a hopper with sling or for a joey? aren't the remotes different for each of them?,"This remote works with both devices. Needs to be ""linked"" in the ""Remote"" section of the ""Settings"" section in each device. You""ll need to either do it on the device controls on the unit or another remote to get to the ""settings"" area..."
Will this fit properly in my Dell XPS M1210?,It fit mine and works well.
does this fit a dell optiplex 760,This drive is usually for laptops however if the desktop you have is one of those mini mini towers and the optical drive is slim it should fit fine
Will it work in Dell Inspiron 620?,"If am not mistaken, I don't think it will work because of the size. It's to small to fit in the bay for this desktop computer."
Will it fit a Dell Inspirion N5110 laptop?,It fit mine. Works great.
Can a regular MP3 player be plugged into it?,"I do not think so. In addition, a lot of phones like my Motorola Maxx does not work with it."
can the phone operate as an alarm/wake to music through the device?,"As long as the speaker is on the entire time, it should work. You might want to check out our other product the HALE Dreamer Alarm Dock for Android and the alarm app available on Google Play."
Does it work with Samsung Galaxy Note 2 ?,"Yes, the speaker dock and the app are compatible with the Samsung Galaxy Note 2. If for some reason you experience difficulties, our engineer will work with you to identify and fix the problem. Also, all our products are backed by a 1 year warranty."
Can you dock your phone if it has an otterbox on it?,"Not really, it wont fit in the slot. I have to take mine off or just lay it on top."
Will it work with Nexus 7 Tablet running jellybean 4.2? My fingers are crossed. Anyone know?,"The Nexus will fit in it standing up, but not on it's side. You can't put it in with the cables facing down, there are things that get in the way. You can put it in upside down though. It looks a bit odd, and isn't held in very securely but it works fine. The buttons on the unit itself don't seem to control the Nexus 7 at all so I have little hope that if the remote was working it would be useful (Mine isn't working.) Still, because the device functions rather well as simple passive speakers and a micro-usb power source you can just plop any device with those connections into it and just play music, so it can be made to work just fine. I'd really like to see a unit just wide enough to hold the Nexus 7 mounted sideways. It would make it a cool little TV watching station. Sadly, this unit's slot is quite a bit too narrow to do that."
"Can you use this to amplify the phone, so that you can talk on the phone hands free?",Yes if you turn off the sonr app then it will be external speakers.
Is this product compatible with the samsung galaxy mesmerize? Thanks!,"I have a htc one x, this product requires you to download a free app SONR. The app give a couple of suggestions for music players that it is compatible with but will open with the pre packaged music player. The speakers can not be used without the app, not you standard audio jack. The speakers are great and very loud. But the app can be frustrating to start and stop. It will still start randomly when not plugged into the speakers muting the phone speakers. I came very close to sending this back due to being frustrated with it and having to remove and reinstall the app or restarting my phone to get it to stop. I then found the widget which is the easiest way to switch off when removing from the device. Also find that when unplugging from headphones our aux cord after using the speakers previously that it will sometimes mute the phone speaker. If you need loud speakers they are decent. Otherwise computer speaker or a smaller dock speaker/charger will do."
Does this work with Moto X?,"Not positive but it is only a headphone jack that plugs in so I'm gonna guess yes.by the way, I'm verry impressed with this product."
I want a speaker for my Samsung Galaxy that enables me to use it to talk not listen to music. Will this speaker dock work for just talking?,"if it is plugged in to the phone and you get a call you can hear the caller over the speaker, but it does not have a microphone...you would have to talk into the microphone that is on the phone...just the same as if you had your cell phone on speaker mode when you answer a call"
Will this play my Creative Labs Zen Mosiac MP3 player?,Don't know for sure. I plug in my Ipod through the headphone jack and it functions like an external speaker. The remote control or even the volume control buttons on the speaker dock will not work with the Ipod. I have to actually make any changes on the Ipod itself. Depending on what you want that might not be enough for you. The dock will work with any device that has a regular size head phone jack. Hope that helps with your decision.
would this film work with the fujifilm instax mini 8?,Yes it will. I have used it in my mini 8.
Expired date is when ? thank you!,"In the product description it states, ""Expiration date always 1 - 2 years ahead of the current date"""
would this film work with the polaroid 300,No. Any polaroid camera needs their own film. These cartridges will only work for instax cameras
Will this film work for the Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 too?,"Yes ,also all Instax MINI models :)"
Dose it fit mini 25 or 8?,"MINI 25 , I owned mini 25 Cheki Hello Kitty :) (All MINI film can fit in all MINI model)"
Does this computer come with Word and which version?,"It's got an office starter kit, which consists of only word 2013 and excel 2013. But both are full versions, not trial versions."
Can I add wifi card for my house in this computer?,"I would recommend getting a USB type, there are expasion slots inside but I have found using an external DLink USB transmitter works well if you have N Technology on your wireless router be sure to get an N type USB card"
does this computer have wifi card in it?,No wifi
Is this computer good for gaming?,"I do not do ""gaming"" and have little experience of it. Have a feeling though that if I did and wanted to be serious about it, I'd get something with more ""horsepower"". Good Luck! Hope it helps."
No hdmi?,No HDMI ... but there's a DVI connection.
does this computer come with 16 or 4 GB of RAM,4 Gig or RAM
Does this card support crossfire?,"Yes, it indeed does. In fact, it comes with a Crossfire cable/connector that you can use to connect the two cards."
"will this crad work with a Intel BOXDP67BGB3 Socket 1155, Intel P67, CrossFireX &amp; SLI, SATA3&amp;USB3.0, A&amp;GbE, ATX Motherboard? i really need to know",What model is the motherboard
BF4,"Yep, works great with BF4, bought it for a buddy."
does this graphics card work with the asus m5 a97 r2.0 motherboard,As long as you have a PCIE slot you should be good to go
"God Bless us All! Does this graphics card support a Windows 7 PC ??? and If it doesn't, what kind of computer would I Need to run this Card well with ???? I can't play APB: Reloaded without a GREAT Graphics Card, and this Card seems to fit the...","Yes, this is compatible with Windows 7. I would recommend the Radeon HD 7980, if you're purchasing soon. It can be found for about $30 more and is a fair bit faster. Based on the APB: Reloaded recommended system configuration, the HD7770 video card can easily handle running the game. You will want a quad-core or core2quad CPU and at least 4GB RAM as well."
Can this run Slender The Arrival on Ultra? Its the only reason im looking for a new video card right now.,"I haven't actually bought, played and tested the game myself, but I went to www.systemrequirementslab.com and it says that this video card can definitely handle it."
Can this card play NTW DarthMod on a 40 inch HDTV?,"Not sure, but it does a good job with BF4 on a 55in @1080 settings roughly on medium-high."
"Does anyone use the card for graphics editing? If so, are you pleased?","I have a system built for Photoshop CS6. ASUS Sabertooth 990FX AM3+;AMD FX-8150; 24gigs of DDR3 Ram; PSU 750 and ASUS 2GB GDDR5 card. It performed as I expected. But what made it even more impressive was when I bought a second card and joined the two in crossfire mode. I was impressed how ""smooth"" it performed running Photoshop. It should be more than adequate for graphic editing with single card."
Does this Graphic Card support audio via HDMI?,Yes. HDMI audio from this card supports 7 channels 192/24. Also bit stream blue-ray HD audio.
does this card fit in PCIe 2.0 x16 slot???,"Yes, I am using a PCIe 2.0 x16 slot for it. The card is kind of wide because of the fans, so make sure you have enough room in case."
Which 1 TB hard disk you recomend between the Western Digital Blue WD10EZEX or the Seagate Barracuda ST1000?,"I'll be honest, I am a fan boy of Western Digital, and ASUS btw, but they don't make HD's. In the last few years, I've had more Seagate drives fail on me, than Western Digital. That being said, I am also hard on HD's, and being in Oklahoma, my PC runs real warm through half the year. I would def. go with the Blue WDEZEX for my money."
"On the picture it shows the hard drive's insides, do I need a special enclosure besides me computer case for this?","I think what his/her concern was is will the platters and internals be exposed. And the answer is no, they will be covered in its own case. They simply show it that way (opened) in the picture"
can a novice install this drive?,"Yes, this a straight forward process plug n play. If you have any concerns, check YouTube for do-it-yourself videos."
I am replacing a Seagate 750 GB Serial ATA 2 hard drive with this in a Dell XPS 435T. Will it work and do I need a new SATA cable? Thanks.,"I will answer with a question of my own- what do you mean by ""work"" ? It will work in the sense that if you plug it in, the new 1TB will spin up and you can use it as you normally would. BUT, it will NOT work at the SATA III data rate that the WD supports (6Gb/s). The reason is, the motherboard (MOBO) in the Dell does not support SATA III, only SATA II. So instead, the WD will spin at the SATA II data rate, which is 3Gb/s. As for cable- the WD does not come with a cable so you will need a new one if you do not plan on reusing the one from the Seagate. However, if you reused the Seagate cable, you should be just fine since I would expect the existing cable is already rated to run at SATA II speeds. But if in the future you got a new MOBO or computer then you would need a new cable that is rated for SATA III data rates."
Is this the retail version (boxed) or is it an OEM bulk drive?,OEM Bulk. No retail packaging. No instructions. Only the hard drive itself - nothing else.
"Is this drive backward compatible with older, slower sata ports",As long as it's sata it should work. I have this being used on a Sata III port.
Will it be comparable to windows 7,I use Widows 7 and the WD hard drive works great. No issues what so ever!
will the SATA 3.0 cable be included? what will be included in the box besides the hard drive?,"No, there was no cable with the drive. My cable came with the control card."
does it come with sata cable,I purchased it a while back I don't remember exactly but to the best of my recollection it didnt come with a cable. You may want to confirm through alternate sources
Can I plug this in as an external hdd enclosure with usb 3.0 capabilites and have it function on an xbox one?,"As long as your hdd enclosure is sata compatible, I don't see why not. This is a 6Gb/s drive so you're better off with something that supports SATA III. SATA I: 1.5Gb/s. SATA II: 3Gb/s. SATA III: 6Gb/s."
I plan to buy this one for this- Has anyone set this up ? DSLRDashboard on TP-Link MR3040 Tutorial - Control your DSLR over Android WIFI,yes. it works fine
Anyone measured the battery life? Does anyone know if the WPS (programming) interface gives a list of connected MAC addresses?,In my case it works for 3 hours at most. Haven't checked if it shows the connected mac addresses.
"Instead of using a USB modem, can I plug my Samsung S3 directly via the USB port and standard cable and use ""Mobile Broadband Connect"" tethering?","I am wondering the same thing. What this person is asking is can we connect the phone using USB to the Router and will it see the phone like a 3G/4G USB dongle? My reason is I need to connect a Printer to the Ethernet (Wired) and use an Ipad connected Wireless to the router to have both Internet access (Shared through the phone connected to the Router) and Print in a special application. If I can use my Phone for the internet 'dongle', I have no 'extra' charges from Verizon to deal with."
Does the RJ45 Port work to supply internet to maybe a desktop?,"yes. I have used it to provide connectivity to a ""smart"" DVD player that required a CAT5 cable to access the internet. Works great."
The LAN port is it output or input? I see two contrasting answers.,That's because it can be either. I use it to make a DSLR camera available on wifi. It's configurable to used as you need. I use OpenWRT to give more functionality.
Can I attach an external USB drive or Hard-drive to it and access from files from USB drive on Ipad on Wifi like Seagate GoFlex Satellite Storage?,"NOT with the current factory firmware (V2 121017). You could ""system tools, firmware upgrade"" it with third-party ""open source"" router firmware to do so (enabling USB storage), but changing to non-TP-Link firmware ""voids"" TP-Link's express-written warranty. TP-Link not honoring their warranty in the U.S. (non-TP-Link third-party firmware or not) violates the Magnuson-Moss Act of 1975, Public Law 93-637, Title 15 United States Code paragraphs 2301 et. al."
I want to use this as a hotel travel router. Can this be used strictly as an AP or is a 3G/4G required?,You can use it strictly as an access point. I travel a lot and use it at hotels that require a sign in page. That way I can still connect my xbox.
Will this work with an Android Tablet?,Yes it should! It is in you wifi settings. It will be there. Now the use with the nikon camera I'm not sure
"When connected to the power adapter, will the TL-MR3040 run without the battery installed?",Yes it will. I just tried it to be sure.
What version hardware is this? V2 or V1?,V1
"My Computer is Pentium Dual Core 2.2 ghz, 1GB ddr2 RAM (will upgrade to 4gb soon), Windows Vista OS, is this video compatible with my PC?",Yes yu pc xpres no problem
Hey which pci express is this card?,Standard PCI Express with a single-width x16 graphics slot. Mine just plugged into my PCI Express slot without issue and the card works great.
does it have the warranty of 2 years? or extended 3 years warranty? I'm talking about warranty from Zotac and not from 3rd parties.,I am not sure about warranty but have had this card for about a yr. now. Very good card for low end gaming and videos.
What is the maximum refresh rate at full HD 1080p resolution? I'm hoping to get 120Hz.,max refresh is 60Hz
will this fit in a dell optiplex 960 minitower?,Yes.
will this card play blue ray movies on windows 7?,Yes
min power supply?,350w but if u have 300w you'll be ok
Does this support 3 monitors?,Yes if one is HDMI.
"I purchased this card, and I get a black screen on boot. I posted a previous question asking if my PC was compatible, and everyone says it is, lol??",it should work normally I install this card to windows 8 computer and its working good I use the HDMI
"does anyone know what the ""windows experience""rating for graphics on this card is?",On win 7 with a quad core processor I get 5.3
"can this frame read ""pdf"" fiels....and if so can you change the configurations",I think it only reads jpg files as far as images go. I just used Microsoft publisher to reconfigure all my images to jpg files.
Does it play music?,No. Images only.
How is this powered? Can you transfer photos to the frame using a usb stick,"Powered with a AC/DC adaptor and it appears it has a battery keeps the memory when the device is unplugged. Photos are transfered with an SD card, not USB."
does it do a slideshow,"It cycles through the images, if that is what you are asking."
Can this be mounted on a wall easily and be able to change out photo or signage easily ?,Yes u could. Do what i did cut a hole in the wall where it sticks out in the back and for the power cord. Cut the end of your power cord and run it down the wall then splice it into a power outlet inside ur wall. Walah you can do anything you want to really. Use somr double sided hook and loop or velcro to attach and remove it from wall. Hope this helps.if u decide to do this let me know ill give u more info on how to do it properly
Does this camera bundle come with a battery and a battery charger?,"Yes, it comes with a battery and a battery charger"

Stud is in the middle of 23"" wide column holding same size TV.","It is NOT on center when pushed flat against the wall.

If you are not playing games than you don't need a new card but if you are playing very new games than you need a better card than you have or are considering so check with HP to find out if you have a PCI Express slot on the motherboard first and if so then you can get a better PCI Express card and put it in however you may need to switch the media adapter in your bios manually if so you need to know what you are doing if not call HP to help you through it or you may find YouTube video's on it make sure you type in your model number for the right video.

Will this work with a 300w power supply?,Absolutely no problem. However you do need to make sure that you have a motherboard that has this kind of pci-express slot/support though and if so your good to go just find out from the manufacturer if it does and if not then you know to ask what kind of card slot it does have and order one for that slot. I hope this helps you.

What did you have to purchase in addition to the basic unit sold by Amazon to get this unit going? I have heard that these units are low emf for those who are electrosensitive. Are you still happy with the item? Thanks!,"I bought a lcd monitor, and a wireless keyboard and mouse by logitec MK300. I have used the fit PC1 and fit PC2 previously and they had ubuntu linux where the fit PC3 had mint linux, so I had a few minutes figuring out the differences. I use this fitPC3 to run continuously and through a usb to X10 interface it turns lights on and off in my house on a schedule, it is very reliable. I also have a usb interface to some weather instruments and it collects and stores readings all day long. The readings are graphed on a web page by apache which was easy to add to the fitPC3. This has been a solid performer for me, I have no regrets. As far as emf, your monitor choices are many times more critical than this box with it's solid metal outside."

Does this have cable management,"Not specifically, no. It is possible to run cables down the center of the pole from the ceiling, but I ended up using black cable ties to just hide them in the back. This mount worked out great for me in my patio, for the record. It was a breeze to install and it just so happened to fit the television mount I already had on my tv."
Does this mount swivel side to side after installation?,No it doesn't. Only can angle it downward or upward slightly
"What size is the pole 1 1/4"", 1 1/2"", or 2""?","Outside diameter is 1 3/4"""

We rely on D-link Cloud cams for our home security and they all perform very well."

how can I get the email alerts to Hotmail account?,Log into setup of camera. Go to settings and there is an email setting to send pictures or videos. You may need to have pop settings handy for hotmail. You can get them off google.
Does it have 2 way audio?,All of these other answers are wrong! As long as you have the H/W Version B.1 you can talk to people on the viewing end of this camera. You have to do it while using mydlink.com. There is a microphone button that you click on and you have to activate it in settings. The audio quality is questionable but it is a two-way audio camera. I use it quite frequently to annoy my wife.

You can also buy/add more to make it longer or if you are handy, custom cut an extension (Home Depot) to exact length. Love this mount!"
"What are the exact lengths of the drops with the extension bar that comes with the product. I am looking to get a 10-12"" drop for my projector.","Unless I'm really misunderstanding how to use it, there's no way you can set this at 10-12"" without cutting the extension poles. Without the extension poles, you are stuck with a fixed drop of 6.75"". I'd estimate adjustable range from about 17"" to 27"" in 2"" increments with the poles. The extension poles are 12"" alone so there's no way you are getting 10-12""."
will this work with a viewsonic PJD5132 3D DLP projector?,The anchors pivot and it is very accessible for many projectors. After fidgeting with the mount I was eventually able to get it to fit correctly. It works great and is really easy to maneuver!
Got this mount and it looks solid. Big worry is the ball joint - my projector weighs 18lb. Any idea if the ball joint will hold 18lb projector?,There's no way this mount want hold 18 pounds jus make sure the ball point screws are tight an mounted screws are secure
Will this work on a Panasonic PT-AE8000U Projector,I'm 99% sure it will it's very universal. I had some doubts about my Favi and it worked fine.
Is this Compatible with SONY VPLHW40ES?,The mount has arms that you can manoeuvre the angles and the length of to fit the screw holes underneath most projectors. I have mounted three different brands and models successfully with my mount.
What is the pipe diameter?,The pipe is 2 inchs
"How much tilt this mount has. I need about 30 degree tilt to project the picture on my screen. Also, does this fit to Epson 7210?","I don't think the mount will tilt that far. As far as fitting a specific projector, the mounting arms do extend and rotate to different angles. It should fit, It fit my Epson EX51."
anyone using on a 3-hole Optoma HD141x? Thanks in advance.,we used the mount with a '3' hole mitsuibishi... doesn't work properly... the pj keeps drifting downwards... had to use a pair of pliers to tighten the plastic screw... would not buy again.. spend the extra $$$ and get a peerless/similar mount...
I have a Nikon D5000 and a Nikon FM2. Will this adapter attach my old lenses to the new camera? If not what should I get?,I honestly don't know. I purchased this T-mount so I could use my manual focus 500mm mirror lens. I would contact B & H photo at 800-606-6969 for technical support questions about your camera and lens fitting issues. They are really great and extremely helpful.
"Has anyone used this adapter with the Nikon D7000? I was ready to order it based on the reviews, but I see one owner reported it did not work.",Thats works perfectly!
"I have a Nikon D3200 - I bought this adapter, put it on - fits great, but when I attach another lens, it will not take a picture. WHY?","I believe if you set your camera to manual mode, it would work just fine. I used mine to hook up to a telescope, and have to be in manual... And it works beautiful!!"
Does this adapter firmly lock into place similar to the Nikon lenses? Does the camera free spin when using this adapter or is there a friction lock?,"It locks into place just as any Nikon lens would. Hope that helps. You can also check videos on youtube for T-ring adapters for Nikon/Canon/Sony/Pentex, Ect..... To better learn about them."
Do this work with the Celestron NexStar 130 SLT and Nikon D810?,I'm sure it works with Nikon D810 on one side. I don't know about the Celestron on the other end.
Can I attach my D7100 to VIxen 80SF? If it doesn't will I need to buy any other accessories to make this work?,"It will fit your camera perfectly! You will need the T-Adapter for your scope.... And of course, you HAVE to have your camera set on manual mode!!!"
Will this work on my Nikon 5200? I have purchased two of these things so far and neither one of them worked at all.,"It fits, but camera does not recognize lens"
"Understand it fits d3xxx, d5xxx I have a few places I can buy older Nikon film camera lenses. Is there a list of lens mounts this fits? Interested.","This adapter allows you to attach to a standard 'T-mount' threaded connection to the Nikon proprietary lens mount. So any lens (or other component) threaded with a 42 mm diameter, 0.75 mm thread pitch can be attached. In theory you can mount any camera body to any lens as long as the T-mount adapters are available for the specific camera body and lens. Wikipedia has a good explanation of the T-mount if you are unfamiliar with them a thttp://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-mount."
I have a nikon d5300 and just found a canon ultrasconic 75-300 lens will this adapter work?,I bought one and it doesn't seem to fit anything I have. I have a Nikon D40 and a Vivitar zoom that uses a TX adapter. That's what I had on my Canon A-1. This T mount doesn't fit anything I have. Sorry.
Is the T/T2 mount the same as an M42 mount? I want to connect my Nikon to my Questar standard.,"I am not sure what the M42 mount is and I don't have a Questar telescope, but this mount adapter (T-ring) connects without a problem to my Nikon D5100. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reFxoF3XoaU"
does this mouse work on mac book air?,Yes! I have a Macbook Pro and it works perfectly! No need to download/install any software for it either :) Just plug it in and enjoy!
"Is usable for any PC or laptop, for example : Toshiba or Dell?","As long as there is a USB port inside of your PC/ laptop you're fine. For example if you have a MacBook, which has no USB ports, then this mouse won't be compatible with it. There is a USB ""cable"" that is about an inch long and you plug it into your PC/laptop's USB port which makes your mouse wireless. I hope this helps!"
Do you have just the usb connection to sell because I lost mine?,"dear customer,thanks for your asking.we don't sell usb connection separately.we sell it together with mouse.hope you can understand.have a great day."
The pointer keeps jumping around the screen - the dongle is plugged directly into a main USB. What's the deal?,"I don't have any problems with my mouse and issue you are having don't occur with me. Sorry, maybe that mouse is defected."
what does the middle button below the scroll button do?,I believe it is to grade the accuracy of the mouse.
this mouse isn't working with my Macbook Air. I have new batteries and its turned on. What do I do now?,"I'm having the same problem, let me know if you found a solution!"
"How do you get this mouse to work. Installed batteries, turned on pluged in the dongle. The red light comes on then goes off a couple of seconds later","I think you have a dud---DOA. Mine worked as a ""plug and play."" Sorry I can not be more helpful."
Is this mouse also compatible w/ Macbook Pro w/ Retina Display?,It worked on my Mac air and Im sure it will work with a pro too....
"When I plug the USB part of the mouse into the usb port, nothing happens on the computer or to the mouse. Am I doing something wrong?","Make sure the switch on the bottom of the mouse is clicked over to ""On"" and if that doesn't work, then try restarting your computer. And if that still doesn't remedy the problem, contact the seller directly for more information! :)"
is this mouse rechargeable?,"no, you have to use rechargable batteries or normal batteries."
can this router be secured so my neighbors can't use it?,yes when you log in to router with 192.168.1.1 (default) username: admin (default) pass: password. there is a option called wireless settings in that you can give your wireless a name and assign passphrase so it can be secured and nobody else can use it.
how to set it up on a hp compaq windows xp,"Best answer is here: ftp://downloads.netgear.com/files/WNR1000_SM_WW_23Jan09.pdf The short answer to your question is this. It doesn't matter what kind of computer you are using to set it up, nor does it matter which operating system you are using. You will use a web browser to do the setup, as described in the setup manual above. The only thing I would caution out about is that you use a standard browser. Explorer or Firefox or Chrome are all good."
Do I need any cords with this or are they in the box?,It has the power cord and the cord connector to the modem.
how do you hook it up on windows xp model by gateway,go to netgear.com you can download software and info.
I live in a two-story house. The main computer with the modem is downstairs and my bedroom is upstairs. Will it still reach me?,"I live in a dorm with all concrete walls. I have no problem with the connection, even with thick wooden doors closed and on the other side of the room."
what is cost per month for router use?,"There is no cost to use the router other than its purchase cost. However, the router must be connected to the internet using an Ethernet cable or dsl modem provided by an Internet Service Provider (ISP) such as your local cable or phone company. You will need to pay the ISP for the internet access. Additionally, you can also use the router to provide a local communications network between two or more local devices/computers."
how many devices simultaneously can be connected to this router?,As many as you wish
Will this work with Comcast Cable internet?,Yes It works. NJ East Windsor (Xfinity)
does it come with a security lock or does that cost extra?,"The router boxed is intact when came to me by USPS. So, don't worry about the security. No extra cost."
Will this work with a mac with the OS X operating system?,"Yes, it works with all computers. We have PCs, macs and iPhones."
How does this lens compare to the 50MM f/1.8,"I'd have to say it comes down to what your purposes/needs are. As others have noted, the 50mm is more cheaply-built, but less expensive and will give you shallower depth of field if that's what you need. That said, if you can deal with a stop less of lens speed, the 40mm is better-built, half the size, focuses more closely, operates more quietly, is at least as sharp, and is overall more versatile."
Is there a circular polarizing filter available for this lens? I cannot seem to find one? Thanks!,"This lens takes a 52mm filter. Amazon sells kits that include polarizing filters, and a quick Google search for 52mm polarizing filters turns up a bunch of other options, in a variety of price ranges."
Availability? Where are these lenses?,just found this on the press release vailability The EOS Rebel T4i Digital SLR camera will be available at the end of June for an estimated retail price of $849.99 for the body alone; $949.99 bundled with an EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS II lens kit and a Movie Kit bundle for $1199.00 with the new EF-S 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS STM lens. The new EF 40mm f/2.8 STM lens and the new EF-S 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS STM will also be available separately at the end of June at an estimated retail price of $199.99 and $549.99 respectively.
Will this fit the new small size EOS Rebel DSLR SL1 camera? I like to take macro shots of flowers &amp; people portraits. Is this a good choice?,"Yes, it's a great lens on the SL1. It also serves well as a head and shoulders portrait lens, but consider an EF-S 60mm for head shots. Google Shawn Barnett + Canon SL1 for my review on Dpreview, and Canon 40mm + Shawn Barnett for my review of the lens on imaging resource, with lots of sample photos, including portraits."
I have a Canon EOS 350D: would this lens work with it?,"Yes, any Canon EF lens will fit the Canon EOS 350D, so this lens will mount onto your 350D."
Should I get this to use on my t5i (1.6 crop sensor)? Or something even shorter?,"While its completely up to you, I will say that this lens is the best for the price in my personal opinion. I feel its a perfect walk about lens and is great for portraiture. I have used it for video but unless you have an external mic, you will be able to hear the motor. I also agree that the auto focus can be slow so I tend to use this one manually. It's not perfect but for someone who lives on a tight budget, it works great for me :)"
"For regular use (taking pictures of people and food) which lens is better, this or the EF-S 24mm f/2.8 STM Lens.",I love them both. I find the 40mm is best for indoors and people because it's just the right field of view for close quarters. The 24 is almost a wide angle lens in comparison.
"For taking indoor shots in a moderate to low light, would you choose this lens or Canon EF 50mm/1.8? I want to specifically compare 1.8",I think the 50mm will give you a very thin dof and will be very soft at 1.8 I use mine at around 2.2 and above.
Will this lens work with a canon eos rebel T5I?,yes
This 40 mm lens fit and work well with Canon SL 1?,Yes. It is a nice lens.
"Release date for the 18-135 STM lens? Does anyone know when the T4i bundled with the 18-135mm EF-S IS STM Lens, will be available to purchased? Thanks.","I contacted Amazon yesterday and he said they will get some in 7-10 business days, but I dont know if it will go back ""In Stock."" I ordered mine on the 6/21."
kit lens vs 18-135? Anyone have insight if the 18-135 really is worth the price difference?,"It's not so much the IS as the ""STM"" or stepping motor used inside this lens vs. the USM motor used in their other high quality lenses. The USM is built to bring subjects into focus with bullet speed. That's great for still image (sports, auto racing, etc) photography but not so good for video where you want a slightly smoother transition when focusing between subjects. The STM motor is designed to work with the new Hybrid CMOS sensor in the camera that utilizes both contrast and phase detect focusing technologies, with the phase detect being the new addition. The STM motor is also stated to be quieter which should translate into less in camera noise being picked up in your videos. Basically once the camera is set into video mode the camera uses the phase detect AF system to get the camera very close to 100% focus lock and then switches over to contrast detect for 100% lock. This of course all happens in nanoseconds. At least this is what I've been able to gleam from the numerous preview articles I've read today. Hope this helps somewhat. FWIW, I'd be looking to get the 18-135 STM kit when/if I do decide to upgrade from my Rebel XT (yes, same camera for 7 years, can you believe it). The flexibility of the 18-135 focal range for all-around still shooting plus the video enhancements make it very appealing. At least as long as the IQ testing backs it up. Plus this lens was stated to sell for around $550 all by itself if I'm not mistaken so in the kit represents a great savings imo."
How does the video quality compare to a standalone camcorder? I have a Canon VIXIA HF100 and would like to replace it with the T4i.,"I have not used a stand alone camcorder but the picture quality on the T4i stood up to my husbands 46 inch big screen without any distortion or issues. There are various settings on this camera regarding the video quality you can use a higher storage capacity to get more footage with a higher quality but if you do that I would highly recommend investing in a battery grip for twice the battery life, although I have never had any issues with mine taking whatever it was being used for the battery grip will give you twice the battery life of a standard battery on this camera. The battery grip holds 2 of the standard batteries for longer shooting or video time with your camera. I have enjoyed every aspect of this camera and plan on using it Thursday to record my Daughters graduation ceremony because it does really well in low lighting. I hope that helps sorry I couldn't give you an honest answer regarding the stand alone but if you do find it is better or worse I would love to hear back from you regarding it. I do know in a comparison of the T4i and the new T5i that the only real difference between them is the price and T3i is great, I bought one for my daughter as a graduation present and couldn't resist playing with it, but the video quality on the T4i was much better and the photo quality was higher. I did a lot of research before investing in my camera and I can honestly say it was time well spent because I truly do love my camera and everything it provides me with."
Amazon just canceled my order of this...not sure why...I didn't get an email saying it was canceled...it just disappeared from my open orders list.,"Same here. It's pretty clear that the 18-135 STM movie kits are very, very scarce, if not non-existant. Lots of speculation about manufacturing problems, etc. Also just quite possible that Canon jumped the gun on allowing retailers to take orders without an adequate supply, and they didn't anticipate such high demand. One dealer in Hong Kong is claiming to offer them right now, and that's about it. You can't even buy the lens or the movie kit from Canon directly right now."
microphone noise?,The focus noise is normal. To avoid it you need to get the newer generation of Canon STM lens. For example the newer 18-55 STM and 18-135 STM have replaced the non STM versions of these lens. These will focus silently.
I am using a( Canon EF-S 15-85 lens)- is this going to cause me to loose benafits of my new T4i over the new 18-135 lens.,"The only think you will lose is the features in the new focusing system and the quietness of the new lens for video recording. In essence, when you have that lens on it will be the same as a T3i for focusing - but you get the benefit of the other features."
What is the difference between EF-S 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS STM Lens and (18-55mm IS II Lens plus 55-250mm )? I am novice. Which is a better buy at same price?,"The new STM lens is an inch shorter and adds a zoom lock and instant manual-focus override to the older 18-135mm EF-S IS lens, however manual focus is electronic. The focus ring isn't connected to anything, and there is a tiny time delay between when you move the ring and the lens moving. Another huge improvement from the older 18-135mm EF-S IS is that the zoom range from 24mm to 18mm has been spread-out on the zoom ring, so it's much easier to set precise wide-angle framing. On the old lens, it was very cramped at the wide end."
Nobody ever talks about the zoom.....beginner and I like to read about the zoom like 18x etc on the t4i,"As mentioned, Zoom factor isn't really relevant for a camera where you can change lenses at will. For example, if you have an 18-55mm lens (55/18 = 3X zoom) and add a 55-250mm lens, you have a total zoom range of 250/18 or nearly 14X. Add a 10-22mm lens and now you now have a total zoom range of 250/10 or 25X. This combination, however, will give you views MUCH wider than any point and shoot camera. What matters with DSLRs is the 'focal length'."
what i sthe difference betwen the IS 2 lense and ISTM lense?,They are both image stabilizing but the ISTM also has a pretty silent motor so that you don't hear it focusing during movie modes.
"One of the Creative Filters is a Fish-eye Effect. Is that a 360 Fish-eye, and is it Full-Frame and/or Circular Fish-eye, similar to the 8-15mm lens?",I believe the fish-eye filter merely gives you a fisheye-like distortion. The wideness of the view will depend entirely on the lens you use.
"So I am going to Alaska to view the Northern Lights. I need a higher aperature than 4.0, do I just get a lens or a new camera body?",People take all sorts of amazing pictures with any camera. A new body will not magically improve your pictures. I would look at getting a lens with an aperature of no less than f/2. Like the 50mm f/1.4 or the 35 mm f/2.
"For an aspiring college photographer who wants her own camera and has previously loved the family T2i, is buying the T4i over the T3i worth it?",I would argue that paying the little extra money for the T4i is completely worth it. It has a newer faster processor and a new touch screen that makes navigating the controls a breeze! I owned the T2i for two years and upgraded to the T4i and it has been fantastic. It's important to get a good lens to really show what your camera can do. I recommend the Tamron 28-75 2.8 lens. It's an overall pretty awesome lens. that's just a side note though. Hope this helps!
"I'm going to be an official photographer for a website, would a Canon Eos Rebel T4i 18.0 MP CMOS be a good choice camera for me?","This Camera is in class kind of the middle of the road for the top end of Canon, BUT! I have had really good quality pictures with this camera. The movies have be very good also. Keep in mind that a camera is just a camera with out the right lens or settings for each shot. But if you don't have a lot of money to spend on a camera then the Canon T4i should work for you well... Go to my site and view my photography work. This will give you and idea on what kind of photography you will be turning out with this camera... You be the judge. https://www.facebook.com/PhotoByJamesPhotograohy?ref=hl"
My Adobe Premier Elements 11 will not recognize video footage from my T4i.My Pinnacle 15 does. How do I convert?,"I wish I could help you there, I don't do much video recording on my camera. I've never tried to use any programs for video. But usually canon has a software that comes with the camera on the disk that allows for video and picture conversions."
I presently have a Rebel XT and want to upgrade. I'm trying to decide between the Rebel T4i or the 60D. Does anyone have an opinion as to preference? I understand the sensor is the same in both cameras and I'd be reusing the lenses from my XT. Price...,"I have not used a 60D, but I bought T4i this summer and I am thrilled with the results. It is 1000% better than the Rebel XT. Sharper image, better color rendering, etc. I could not be happier with the performance of the T4i."
Where is it made?,Japan
"t5i better than t4i? Also I have the standard 18-55mm, 70-300 mm, 50 mm f1.4 and 18-135mm (all Canon). Will the listed lenses work on both t4i and t5",All canon lenses will fit all canon rebel models
Does the Eos Rebel 3 lens work on the Eos Rebel 4?,Yes
I own a canon rebel xt. Will the lens I have for the xt work on a canon t3i or t4i camera?,"Yes. Canon does their best to make all their EOS cameras use the same lenses. Some features on new lenses (like the continuous AF of the STM lenses) won't work on the older bodies, but the lens will fit and work like any other lens you've used with single shot AF."
I'm in the market for 2 of the Canon EOS Rebel T4 cameras. I do have an EOS Rebel T3 regular lens. Is it interchangeable with the T4?,Yes it is.
"I had the T2i before, but now i got the T4i, which is a nice upgrade. In the T2i there is a A-deep mode in the wheel, where is that option in the T4i? Can anyone let me know? Thanks!","Canon decided to remove the A-Dep mode from the T4i to make room for new modes on the dial. They claimed that A-Dep was very rarely used and pretty much obsolete for DSLRs. As a replacement for A-Dep, you can shoot in AV mode and vary the aperture setting with the dial in order to change the depth of field. You can also try 'shifting the program' in P mode using the dial to get a smaller or larger aperture to adjust the depth of field."
"Hello! Could you please describe more details about this item? Such as, is it completely working well? How about the len condition and warranty? THX","This is my first dslr, definitely wanted a canon EOS, just didn't know whether to get the T3i or T4i. After doing weeks of comparisons, and realizing I could get the touch screen T4i at about the same as the T3i during an after-xmas sale, I made the purchase. This is a lot of camera for a first time dslr person, who is intent of being 'auto-free' when shooting pix. I love the possibilities of this camera and amazed at the technology available to me to create artistic photos and not just run-of-the-mill pictures. For those that do want the auto features, this camera will do it all. The touch screen LCD is an added bonus. As for the lens, it's a pretty good kit-type lens, not a lot of fluctuation in quality between f-stops. It's something that will work for me til I become the dslr master I want to be. I will then add highe quality lenses to my bag of tricks. Battery power is very long, no complaints. Have not had the camera long, so no warranty issues. This camera is feature packed, whether in creative mode or auto mode, and makes it easy for beginners and experts alike to create some pretty special memories. I love this camera!"
can you get it with a 18-135 lens?; do other canon lenses fit from my old 35mm canon?,"Yes, I see the T4i 18-135mm STM kit listed here and elsewhere. Old Canon FD mount lenses will not fit any Canon DSLRs. Old Canon EOS EF lenses will work with the T4i though some film-era 3rd party lenses may not be completely compatible. Note that the smaller sensor in the digital Rebels will crop the image from the lens and make it appear as if you are using a 1.6 times longer lens. For example, your old 50mm lens on the T4i will appear more like an 80mm would on your film SLR and 28mm and 35mm lenses won't be wide angle lenses when used on the T4i."
Is there any reason why I should buy the T4i instead of the T5i? They are the same price and the T5i seems to be a little faster,Buy whichever is cheaper. The differences between the 2 are so small. T5i has a 360 degree dial and some extra creative filters. I don't think it's worth the extra price.
does it have a mic input,Yes it has a 3.5mm mic input.
does this camera come with a charger?,"Comes with a charger, USB Cord to upload photos, a cd to help you learn about your new camera, a few Manuel's, camera lense protectors, and a camera strap."
"Alright. So I have a youtube channel, blog and online store. I also enjoy taking nature shots just for fun. Will this work or is a there a better one?","Yes, I am also a youtuber. I got this because the video on it is better than the three, but its best for taking pictures around 5k res, The video and audio sound great, I have had no problems, at all, or any complaints, If I were you, id go on ebay, and get the cheap generic brand 2 pack batteries for this also, becuase it helps a ton when your out some place taking pictures, the one I got was under 20 bucks, and it even came with adapters, and a car charger."
"Hi, how come the camera take 5 to 6 seconds to take a picture? Did I messed up something in settings? Thank you","Are you shooting full auto or using the creative zone? You can control your exposure time in the Tv & M settings the simplest way is to utilize the back touch screen use the Q button to access touch control select the shutter speed its the top left corner if the number has a "" those are full seconds if its a fraction well thats a fraction of a second generally with a camera this heavy I wouldn't use slower than 1/160 without a tripod. If you are using other settings try adjusting your aperture (F stop) & ISO they are the other 2 legs of your exposure triangle. You my want to check out some books about your camera ""Canon 4TI /650D Experience"" by Douglas J. Klostermann is a good start! Keep learning & explore your new camera!"
"I might rent this camera for prom,so I'll be shooting stills and video.How good is the quality and autofocus in lowlight withlotsof subject movement?","I love my camera! I've never really used it for that type of pics, but for me it does great. I took some pics of my brothers wedding, Kind of an indoor outdoor setting & I'd did great both ways. I think you'll really like it."
Is this camera good for action shots? I like to capture the moment when its happening to i need a good camera to do so.,"While not as fast as Canon 7D, this camera can be used for action shots. Keep in mind that you will need a proper lens and some skill to obtain satisfactory results."
will this router work on a mac with maverick operating system?,"i don't have maverick on my computer, but i would imagine that it would work. it has been a great router for me so far. easy to set up. easy to use. haven't had any problems with it."
does the antenna come in the box?,No a antenna was not included or not needed.
do u need to use wifi with it,I'm not sure I understand. This product connects to a modem from your ISP and gives you wifi.
is the internet free??,What do you mean? Nothing is free! This is just a wireless router and must have an IP address if you want your wireless devices to access the internet.
Can this router be used as repeater/bridge?,"I never tried this, my only reason for buying this is to replace an existing router."
what is the warranty period,"I believe there is no warranty on these units. These are older units which means you probably won't even get support from Netgear. Take your chances with no warranty. It's a crap shoot but usually in your favor when you weigh out the cost/risk. You get one that works and you just made one heck of a deal. A bad one? Well, you gambled and lost. Your chances are much higher of getting one that works like new than one that doesn't. Also remember people are much more likely to review something they didn't like than something they did like."
How do you setup this router?,"Plug modem into WAN port, your computer into LAN port, open your browser and type 192.168.1.1 in the address bar. Enter default user name and password (you will need to find online). Being refurbished, it may be possible that the default UN and password had been changed and not reset (I had that with some different refurb units I bought elsewhere). If that's the case use the reset button on the back of the router. Go through on screen tabs to make the adjustments you need."
will this router connect my cable modem to my computer and cd player to get netflix using ethernet connections not wireless,I don't know. I use it only to be able to use my laptop in another room. This way I don't annoy my wife. I am not that computer literate.
Does this router can work with cable modem ?,Only if you connect it using the WAN. This router does not have a coax port.
What version is this?,It says v3. greg

Can I mount this router to my ceiling? In other words can I remove the base and mouth it horizontally?,"I got this for my dad, both sides are smooth. Did not see any keyhole cutouts for mounting screws"
Does it come with instructions,"Yes, it came with a slip to explain simple set-up instructions. Very easy set-up, took about 2 minutes."
Bottom line - am I sacrificing anything by getting this $25 refurbished router? Any reason to spend more? It seems too good to be true...,Bought this and set it up for my mom a year ago. Still working fine.
hooking this up after my DSL modem will allow to me to send a wireless signal to my remote laptop?,I would imagine so. As long as you have a wireless network set up. But I'm not particularly tech savvy so I won't swear to it
does the router come with accessary,No
is this a dsl router or cable thanks,"It should work well for either. Im using the one that I bought here on a cable connection, but the one at my office is the same router, brand new not refurbished...and that connection is DSL."
"A reviewer says ""most professionals would never use auto-focus"". How would pro-shooter quickly switch from an object at 200ft to one that is at 10ft?","If you have time to set up the shot first, you could practice changing focus, keeping track of where your fingers are at either end of the shot. If not, you might have to zoom in very quickly, get focus, then zoom out quickly to the framing you want. If you have an assistant, they could handle focus for you (small piece of white tape to mark both distances on the focus ring). Auto focus tends to be more of an issue in low light."
Just received my AG-AC130A and there is noticeable noise when zooming in and out. I hear it when playing back clip. Is this everyone's experience?,"Try manual zoom instead. When using the automatic function, you're probably just hearing the mechanization. If you don't like manual zoom, try setting up an alternate sound capture device/location closer to your target, or remove some of that noise via a background sound reaction feature in your editing software."
does it come with a mic,No external mic. Built in yes.
Is this the AP130A that has the upgraded autofocus package?,"Not AP130a, it's the AG AC130a. It does have the upgraded autofocus and does a decent job. The camera is awsome."
does it come with usa warrantee?,yes it includes a USA warranty
Does the AG-AC130 record on 1080/24p,yes
Does this come with the self portrait mirror attachment?,"yes, mine did!"
what color is it?,Just as shown in the picture - black. There is another one in a different color that takes pics just a little smaller. I wish I would have gone w/that one.
how long does the film last? how should we store it if unused for 6+ months?,Film typically can last for years as long as it's still sealed in the cartrage plastic it comes in. Keep it away from excessive heat and excessive light. Don't ever unwrap a cartridge unless you intend to use it soon. Generally you can keep it in a drawer or closet. I keep mine in a cardboard box in my closet. Works perfectly fine and I've had the film for over a year and a half. I've kept film in my camera for months and it works fine but I also keep my camera in a zipped camera bag. Hope this helps
how long will it take to ship to new york?,My camera took about 6 to 7 days to come. I tried to track but it sat in one spot for about 4 days without moving. And It was a birthday gift and was supposed to be used on my little ones surprise Disney trip to start her scrapbook but it made it waaaay to late! Not a quick shipment at all! It came from Cali and they don't use Fed-Ex! Plus it is huge!!
Will it work on my Sony VGP BPS21B,"I do not know, It did not work on my VGP BPS21A and I have not found one that will...I was able to return and get a refund"
does it work with VPCF12LGX/B?,"I have a model PCG-81214L My screen is a VPCF12AFM the battery has worked great but a few months ago i got a message on My screen saying something about a non Sony battery being used. This stop it from operating so I turned off the laptop and removed the battery and reinstalled it and it worked fine after that. Turn your laptop over and us the model number on the black label. That will be the true model number. I have the battery that replaces Sony battery part numbers VGP-BPS13, VGP-BPS13/B, VGP-BPS13/Q, VGP-BPL13, VGP-BPL21"
"Hi, This battery will work with the Sony Vaio model PCG-81114L ?","It was a ""fit"" replacement for my Sony battery. The battery work great and was actually a little bigger in that it had a riser on the bottom that makes the back of my Sony be off of the flat surface about two inches, which is great. This battery works great!"
"does it work on sony vaio VGCF13L8E laptop wihich has a VGP-BPS21 battery pack (4200mAh, 11.1V)?",Yes it work about 5 hours
Wii it work on my Sony sve11125cxw?,Probably ... but do not expect it to last as advertized. You may get 45 minutes to one hour if that ...
Will this battery replace my original battery for VPCF1?,I have a Vaio VPCF12AFM and works just fine!
Will this replace my battery VGP-BPS21A,"The battery will work with the laptop just fine. If you have a port replicator (docking station) for your Vaio, this battery may prevent it from docking correctly as the battery extension may not be in the exact same location as the Sony OEM high capacity battery, that the dock was designed for."
Does this converter box work with an epson projector HDredy?,Friend uses it with his Hd Projector. Watched Prometheus with superb results. Just like cinema. Wish I'd gone for a projector instead of HD TV. :)
"Will this work on 72 inch vertual screen glasses and video source from smart phone through 3.5mm to 3RCA and 3RCA to HDMI cable?""","I have a pair of 60"" virtual screen glasses and the unit works just fine with those. Only problem I had was sorting out cables I needed. As long as video signal into box is HD, then it should work fine."
Does this converter box work with a Sony 3D blu ray player?,"Yes, works well with all Blu-ray players so far,"
can you get a lot of tv channels with this,This isn't a 'Smart Tv box' or similar. It takes an HD video signal from whatever source and outputs it to your 2D TV or projector enabling you to watch in 3D. Both Side-by-side or Anaglyph red/cyan type.
New laptop with windows 8. Will the 2014 software work on it or am I looking at the 2013 software and what is the difference between the two?,Every year DeLorme updates its maps and puts out the next version (2014 for example). The software and its compatibility are not changed - just the road map itself. I am running Street on Windows 7 and 7 Pro with no compatibility issues. You should not have any problems with Windows 8.
This includes the Delorme Street Atlas 2014 as well as the GPS attachment?,"yep, that is what the little round gadget is. I have been using delorme since the early days and this is one of the few products that costs less and has gotten better!"
The tablet I want to use this with only has a mini USB connection. Will this still work using an adapter?,"I don't see why it wouldn't, same plug configuration, just smaller version with the mini usb vs standard usb. :-)"
Will this unit work with Windows 8 MS Street &amp; Trips 2009?,"If you go to the Delorme website, you can download a serial emulator for free that will allow you to use it with MS streets. You do realize that it comes with a much better travel program that is updated to 2013?"
Will this unit work with Windows 8 MS Street &amp; Trips 2009?,"I'm sorry. I cannot answer that as I have no knowledge of it. However, I can tell you that with Street Atlas there was a problem created with Windows 8/8.1 that appears to be related to a Windows update somehow. I don't have the particulars on that, but I do have some info. Yes, there is a fix. The problem occurs shortly after cranking up the GPS BU 353 s4 Antenna. Windows will eventually experience a Blue Screen of Death, go into an automatic reboot, and be just fine until you try to use that BU 353 s4 again. This same problem occurs with Windows Vista using the original BU 353. I'm told it also occurs with Windows 7, but I have no first hand knowledge of it. Anyway, there is a fix on the Delorme website for this. ****IMPORTANT***** Be sure that the BU 353 s4 GPS antenna is plugged in and nothing else when you go through the fix. The webpage for Delorme on this matter is titled ""Troubleshooting the GlobalSat BU-353 GPS Receiver"". If you do find a problem as described above with Windows 8 MS Street & Trips 2009 I'd suggest looking to see if that same fix applies and if it's not mentioned then give Delorme a call. They answer their phone M-F, 09:00 to 17:00 Eastern time. Another symptom is while the tracking is working and you're driving along all of a sudden you glance over at the screen only to find out you just drove the last ten miles of a 20 mile trip and you still have twenty miles to go. In other words, the antenna is working, but the tracking has frozen."
Can you chart trips on a sailboat with this on my laptop say from New York to North Carolina?,"I have used DeLorme Street Atlas before to mark where I dropped my crab pots and such and it worked great for that before I got a plotter for the boat. I suspect it would work, but for serious navigation I would highly recommend something with nautical charts, including depths, navigation markers, Etc. If you get stuck in the fog or nasty weather while boating you want something better than a street map."
Does it require WiFi?,No. Just put the GPS receiver on your dashboard and plug it into your laptop computer. Of course the CD must be installed first. You then can plan your trip using any stops or via's before you depart.
Does this product include the complete 2013 DeLorme Street Atlas? On DVD or how?,"I saw somewhere, think the Delorme site, where you can download 2013. Didn't see if you could with 2014 though, I am looking for that answer."
Is the included GPS the BU353S4 with the SIRF IV chipset or is it the BU353 with the SIRF III chipset?,It is the SRF STAR III chipset.
what is the price,The price for a new Unit is $499. Thank you for your interest.
Did it come with the rack mount kit?,No it did not. Sorry. That is usually left to the buyer because it is difficult to know the hardware needed for every situation.
pls give to know if it works 220v power input,No only 110volts
is it multi zone,yes great player had mine for over a year works flawlessly
How does this player compare with an OPPO 103 for audio quality? Does it have a comparable on board DAC?,"As someone who took a chance on this, I'm happy. Pair it with a good basic Denon amp and it will work."
can I use 220v without transformer?,Nope
does this product stream amazon instant video,"I don't think so. It has Netflix and some other services, but I did not see the Amazon instant service. Fortunately both my tv and ps4 have Amazon."
"How smoothly does DLNA video file playback work? Do you experience lockups when trying to skip file ""chapters"" or pressing fast-forward/reverse?","None whatsoever, if this unit is within your budget I would advise purchasing it"
does this player upscle to 4K or UHD?,"Dear Peter, Thanks for your inquiry. Since there are no 4K or UHD discs available, the Blu-ray player itself does not upscale. There are however, many audio receivers that do upscaling and perhaps that is what you are asking. Hope that makes things clearer for you. Regards, Eric Cohen World Wide Stereo"
I purchased this mount and I can't figure out how to make it tilt - the directions weren't clear on what to loosen and where to allow the tilt.,The bracket that screws to the tv can slide up or down a small amount which will allow the tv to tilt downward. Unfortunately the tilt is not great. I did not have to loosen anything.
I want to use the bracket to mount a small TV up near the ceiling - will the head tilt far enough for the TV to be viewable from that high ?,"I think it would be ok. Mine are mounted about 10"" down from the ceiling and it is just perfect to watch tv sitting up or laying in bed."
I am looking to use something like this to mount small speakers . Would these rattle?,i am not really sure it is sturdy. i don't see why you should have a problem. good luck
Will this monitor mount allow me to rotate the monitor between portrait and landscape views WITHOUT removing or re-mounting it?,TheMount Will rotate clockwise 270
I'm looking for something to mount a flat indoor digital TV antenna and be able to easily aim it and have it stay in place. Will this do the job?,"That's what I bought it for and it works perfectly fine, you have to tighten it down fairly hard in the back so it doesn't swing left and right. But once you get it tightened it works like a charm."
why can I not get this shipped to canada?,You can order the same item from Amazon.ca
"Need to mount a 22"" monitor to a wall perpendicular to the desk. Are the arms able to extend to the fullest while the monitor attachment is turned 90 degrees? Thanks.","Hi, I have a 22"" tv on mine...I just tried that out and yes you can, the arms extend to the fullest and I was able to turn the tv 90 degrees. However because of the cables attached to the tv, it swiveled back to its original position. If your cables don't get in the way you won't have this problem."
"Hi, does the head of this braket TILT up and down? we want to mount the tv high and be able to tilted towards us (down)..??",it does tip a little bit but not a lot
"The instructions state the controller requires a T-Mobile 2G sim card to call your cell. T-Mobile only sells 4G. Can I use that? If not, where would I find a 2G? Do you need a standard, micro or nano card?",from my experience when I first got the unit I tried using an AT&T sim card. The unit did not work as it was supposed. I wasn't able to control it remotely from my cell phone. I called the seller and they advised me to use a t-mobile sim card. I then went to t-mobile and activated a prepaid SIM card and then the unit worked as it was supposed. from my understanding AT&T no longer has 2g capability but T-mobile does. Hope this helps. The seller's customer service is also pretty good.
PiSector versus Fortress? They look the same,Do not buy this it is junk and the company will not honor the return. Get simply safe alarm system instead. Do not buy it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Does this system announce the zone that is in alarm?,"It does announce the zone that in alarm, but does not identify individual sensor, unless you keep each zone only one sensor."
"When tripped, does the siren make noise continuously until deactivated? Hours? Or a few minutes like a car alarm?","Just go in to the program menu, find sirens, and there you can set how long you want the siren to sound when activated. You can set it anywhere from 1 - 999 seconds"
any app for monitoring?,No App for GSM06 model
would it work with any gms carrier as I live outside of the U.S and would have to rely on a local phone company,"This system base on 2G service, you may consider of GS08 model http://www.amazon.com/PiSector-Cellular-Wireless-Security-Quad-band/dp/B007GP3JUA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1427142120&sr=8-1&keywords=pisector"
where do you get sim card with t moble.I have att,"I don't believe AT&T has sim cards. I already had T-mobile service, so that is why I selected that vendor. You can choose any vendor that issues sim cards. as for basic line services, should be like 10$/month. The unit will accept line lines if you already have one, but if lan line is cut by intruder or service is down, the unit will not call out."
works perfectly here in Venezuela ??,Yes
"I intend to buy this and install in India, which GSM mobile subscriber will it support there?","Hello, I'm sure it works with any GSM mobile subscriber, what I did was to chose the one who have the strongest network, less cuts in network, so that your house stay always protected. Hgs"

How big is this device?,"its the size of a small pager, but the one I got is garbage and the directions will not help you, do not buy this product."
SIM card: Anyone knows what type of SIM card I need for this device?,"I bought one from At&t , but you can use one from any cell phone that has one, You do need one that is active. keep the phone you may need it you 1. activate the sim card in the phone. 2.place activated sim into gps tracker. then follow directions they come with."
"I want to split the signal from XBOX One to TV and Samsung Laptop Monitor, will this work?","If the XBOX, TV and Laptop have HDMI jacks, it should. If you can drive the TV and Laptop separately with HDMI, this device is designed to allow both to utilize a single HDMI input simultaneously. One signal in, two signals out."
I want my two TVs (different sizes) to play the same show at the same time. Will this split the one signal off of my XboxOne controlled Fios box?,Yes. It will take an HDMI signal input and split it so you can play it on 2 different TV/Monitors.
"How does it work with blue ray? Our TV only has one HDMI port which is connected to a Dish hopper. Can we switch from satellite TV to the blue ray without doing it manually with this device? I also have read about audio issues on these connectors ,has...","No, nsa, as Don A. says, this box takes the HDMI output from one device -- like your blu ray player, and splits it to send the signal to two TVs, not the other way around (choosing between two signal sources to feed one TV). When dealing with a HDMI signal, it does not matter the source (blu ray, DVD, game console, etc.); HDMI is a common type of communication between AV devices. What you are looking for will be called an HDMI switcher or switch box; most likely you will have to do something (push a button on the box, or on a remote) to select which signal gets fed to your TV."
I want to leave it on all the time for use as needed with two tv fed from one receiver. Does the device get hot if left on?,Mine is at my business and NEVER gets turned off. No problems at all

Is there any lag or latency when using this?,No
Can I run a PowerPoint presentation from my tablet (w/HDMI port) to two HDMI flat panel TV's?,Yes

I want to hook up 2 hdmi monitors to my laptop. Will i be able to extend the screens or just duplicate (mirror)?,it will mirror the image to all 4 outputs
"Hello, i read in an article that this splitter can strip the HDCP protection - is this true because if it is then i will purchase it","The version I received does indeed strip HDCP. However, there is no 100% guarantee (although very likely) that the one you'll receive will do the same."
I want to take my Time Warner Cable box HDMI output to my Samsung TV and I would like also to hook it to a Samsung computer monitor. Will this work?,It will definitely split the signal to the tv. To the laptop it should but not positive. Just goggle that ?
"I bought this to be able to swap from my xbox to my TV to my ps3, is this not the right item!?",Only if you have HDMI inputs and outputs to devices. If so it will work great.
will this device take one input and display it to all output at the same time,"Yes. I have mine connected to the output of my AVR (AV receiver), splitting to a projector and a TV. I've had both running at the same time, no problem."
"Just received the splitter, and running a 45 ft HDMI cable from my Tivo box to my kitchen tv. Still no single and won't bypass the HDCP.",try a test with a shorter cable
This will work with my laptop? Sorry technically challenged.,"Yes it will work; however, if you have a mini HDMI on your laptop, you'll need an adapter to convert to a full size HDMI to work with the switcher box. Hope this helps."
"Does anyone have experience using this with directv? I have the Genie DVR and Mini Genie, Will I be able to split the Mini Genie to 2 different tvs?","I presently use this on a directv dvr to 3 different tv, Been working fine for the past 6 months"

Will this work with the Sling box 500 useing the HDMI connection to disable the HDCP so you can use HDMI instead of component ?,I do not know the answer.
I need to replace old LNB's to my FTA satellite. Please tell me if it is going to work. Thank you. Also should I buy LNB brackets for these LNB's ?,"so make sure you have the settings correct on your FTA satellite box for this LNB type, check your receiver manual if necessary. if not set correctly you will not get a quality signal. Since you are only replacing the LNB, you should have no problem with acquiring a signal, but also make sure you set the LNB to the correct skew. Best to use the ""quality"" signal scale on the receiver as you are moving it (the signal level just provides power info to the LMB and back not satellite signal power, so use the quality scale, they both work hand and hand but when you have a good high quality signal you will have the best capability for the system not to rain fade on you and have picture break up). Also move the LMB towards and away from the dish on the bracket to see if you can also get a better quality signal. Remember the signal change will take a little time to move so don't rush the movement of the LMB, do it slowly. Show Less"
Will it work SkyMex?,"haven't installed it yet, headed to michigan in may. will post how it works"
"I got this laSt year, but it does not get Galaxy 19(the old Telestar 5) OR CAN IT , THEN HOW ??",read a bit more as you are not using the right LNB

hi there review are very good on this lnb my question is will this lnb work 118/119 dish network?,"Hi wayne no it would not work with 118/119 ,there is a special circular lnb for 118/119 you can get it right here on amazon the strong lnb's are for leaner sat."

There is no need to connect to router with Ethernet cable. Connect to computer with Ethernet cable away from router and follow the installation instructions to setup the wifi connection to your existing wifi router.
"Netgear said I need the serial number, which is not on the case, in order to connect, etc. Can you provide it?","Across the board, Netgear scratches off the Serial Number when they refurbish their products; they are no longer under the standard manufacturers warranty. To connect devices, you might need the IP address or the MAC address, but not the Serial Number. I am say this information having purchased several other Netgear refurbished products, but have not yet ordering this specific item."
How do you install the new firmware onto this wireless extender? NetGear will not support this product through phone or email.,If you have firmware version V1.1.0.12 there is no other firmware needed. If you have a question: http://kb.netgear.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/14239/~/wn2000rpt-faqs
How Far Does This WiFi Range Extender Reach?,"I have it inside my house, about 16 ft away from front wall, and I have connected outside the house, across the street about 50 ft away. Don't know actual range, but it's pretty good for my needs."
how far distance from access point,I've noticed if I'm more than about 30 feet away from the primary router it starts to disconnect.
does this come with a AC wall charger?,It come with a plug and wire so you can plug it in the wall. Very good product!
How many times can this be charged? Maximum cycles?,I really don't know but I'm sure that info is out there. I don't use it constantly so my charging cycles have been limited. It does seem to hold it's charge well between cycles.
"What is the difference between the black and the silver (""Premium"") model?","There was no Silver available when I bought mine, but based upon the specs, I would say there is no difference other than appearance."
will this charger work for iphone 4 and 4s,Yes I use it all the time - u just need to plug your charger cable into it :) I LOVE this thing!!
how many times can it charge a phone or ipad/galaxy note pad on a full charged battery,"I have fully charged ten completely dead smartphones with my Satechi 10000, before it needs to be recharged itself"
Will this charge the tablet on my HP Split x2 ?,No. The X2 needs the 45 watt 19v 3 pin 4.5 mm connector. It does not charge from USB.
Will it charge an iPad 4th generation?,"Yes, i have used it to charge the same type of ipad."
Has anyone taken the Satechi changer in carry-on luggage and through the screening at an airport? Did TSA make you remove from bag (like laptop etc.)?,"I took it on a plane this summer, and left it in my carry on to go through screening. No problem"
Can one be using one's mini iPad while charging it on the Satechi?,My understanding is that it does NOT allow flow through charging.
I have an Asus tablet. Will the Satechi portable energy station battery charger pack be compatible for it? Thanks in advance for any assistance with this.,"It comes with a few converters, but I am not sure if it will be compatible with your tablet. However, if you have a USB cable you can plug it right in and it will work. If you can use an android charger for your tablet then this will work for sure."
do i need to utilize the power or can i use the power directly from my power supply withouth going through the chip with extra cables,"If you have a extra power dongle from the power supply, you can use it. If not, you can purchase a Computer Molex 4 Pin Power Supply Y Splitter Cable Generic from Amazon"
will this work with a SATA dvd drive on an apple powermac g3 that uses IDE?,No
Does this work with Windows NT?,I don't know. If you cannot get the specs on it then the only way is to get it and try it out.
Will this allow me to connect a Blu-Ray drive through my montherboards IDE and actually be able to play Bluy-Ray movies?,"Yes, it contains the PATA to SATA, or vice versa, connection. I bought this a month ago. Works well on my dvd burner drive!"
It is possible to connect my IDE CD/DVD-ROM to my SATA motherboard with this adapter ?,"I have not physically tried to hook mine up that way, and the more I stare @ it, the more I think it's NOT possible. The reason is this plugs right in to the back of a SATA drive by itself, but it will NOT hook up to an IDE/PATA drive without a dbl ended adaptor. That goes for the power plug too. What you need is this: http://www.amazon.com/IDE-SATA-Adapter/dp/B000RK89M4/ref=sr_1_4?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1379231358&sr=1-4&keywords=pata+to+sata+adapter , which appears to work in both directions. Hope that makes sense :)"
work with xboxs,If it's an Xbox 360 it should have SATA in it and to put a PATA drive in it then it won't fit because this is for 3.5 drives and I'm pretty sure the Xbox has a 2.5 drive. If the Xbox has 3.5 drives then it will work but you won't be able to close it up for it being to bulky
Does the OS on the key support french ? Thanks fr any help.,Yes that was an install option
"So, what is this exactly, is it the whole Operating System or what?",Yes. It is a complete install of the operating system but make sure your system is capable of running osx Lion first. Find out if you have to be running leapard or snow leapard first....I don't recall off hand.
Hey There! Ok I have this mac Thumb Stick in my hand- How do I used it. Chris Casson,Place it into your USB drive and boot into the USB drive.
Can I use this thumb drive on a clean install? Im changing the hard drive.,The Lion will create a new OS system. It wipes out the older OS system and prepares for the new OS Lion and installs it. Good luck JH
How many licenses are available with the product?,"As per the license agreement, if you obtain Lion via the Mac app store, you are granted permission to install on all Snow Leopard Macs that you personally own/control. If you have Lion pre-installed on a new Mac or obtain it via a USB key purchase method, the license only permits use on one Mac."
"I bought an old used Mac (2008) -- i cleared everything off and tried to restart it-- it keeps saying "" PLease download OS X Lion"" will this disk work","It should, since it is the Lion OS software. It is asking you to install an operating system. Lion is probably the latest OS you can install on your computer so that is probably why it's telling you to download Lion. I'm no expert but that's my guess."
What is the memory capacity?,"Please do not use this OS X chip as a memory device!!!! The chip contains a system upgrade for ""Lion"" and that is about it. Purchase a memory chip (thumb drive) for your storage needs. Have a great day! Jeff"
Is this going to work with a macbook air a1237? 1.1?,Yes for sure... I used it for a first gen and second gen macbook air...
I bought a refurbished iMac which came with 10.8 and I'd like to downgrade to 10.7 - would this work for that?,I don't know you need to take it to a MAC store and ask them. Why do you not want to upgrade to the latest OXS Yosemiti
can i use this to install mac os x on my pc,"Sorry, I have have not tried. But I do not believe it will work because MacOS needs a special feature (I guess a bootsrap ROM) on the hardware. Though a modern Mac is just a PC and can run Windows, only Apple's macs have this device than enables MacOS to work."
Does it come with a battery and charger? I didnt see it in the description or pictures so i was just wondering...,"of course, it's a D3200 Camera package PLUS these other things"
I am a beginner in the photography arena. This camera comes highly recommended and it's price point is excellent. Please help me determine the basics.,"I'm a beginner also but the camera I so easy, plus the manual says most of what u need to know. I also bought the book Nikon D3200 for dummies great buy."
Does it have the function of jitter correction?,Yes
does it come with a bag,Yes
No include the Snap for the Lens?,No it doesn't
Is everything new? Can this package come with a red camera?,"Hi, thanks for your questions. The Product Page shows that this camera and kit is being sold in new condition by 8 sellers. You can see this to the right of the product picture, it shows ""8 new from $574.00 1 used from $729.00."" According to the product picture, this camera comes in black, but you may wish to contact one of the sellers to ask about the availability of other colors. I hope this helps!"
Does this come with the wireless mobile adapter?,"Unfortunately, no. I was hoping it would include something to allow me to upload pictures to my iPad, but no such luck."
Does it come with all that is pictured?,"Yes but I suggest you to buy the Body only, and buy a seperate lens to tend your need. You dont need the whole package."
Does this camera come with HD Video?,Yes it does.
I purchased this item and cannot figure out how the two Vivitar lenses that were included attach to the camera. Is it missing an additional piece?,The lenses screw on to the 18-55 lens that it came with.
does it come with a power supply and if not what kind does it need ?,"No, for the price you really can't expect that. You would need to purchase your own Siamese cable (power/video) combo. I got mine here at amazon, inexpensive I think I got the QSEE brand. Quality on this very inexpensive china made camera is crazy good, for the price. I'm very happy with my purchase. I purchase an all white 6 bullet camera 700 tvl and 1TB dvr, I ended up using 2 of these and 4 of the bullets. So happy with my purchase."
"I want to use this camera &amp; view on my pc monitor. I have a vga port and usb port available. What adapters, etc. do I need? Thanks!",You will need a capture card that is designed to use with CCTV cameras.
Can this be connected to a computer?,"Kind of - the camera has a special type of RCA plug called a ""BNC"". It comes with an RCA plug adapter, so to connect it to a computer, you would need an RCA (video in) plug on your computer. You can buy a ""security card"" IDE or PCIE, and it will use your Hard drive to record. I actually started this route, but found it better to just buy a seperate DVR, and you can access the device from a computer or smartphone from anywhere. The camera is pretty good for an outside, all weather unit."
Can it be mounted on a wall without wall bracket?,Yes! No bracket required. There are screw holes in the base plate.
"What is the viewing angle of this ""Wide Angle Lens""?",About 180 and the cameras have good clarity. I would buy more for the price...good camera.
does it have a zoom is it 3.6mm to 12mm?,"No zoom, simply 3.6 wide angle camera does work well day and night. Decent image quality As usual amazon has them up for a good price I use 8 of these type in my home system"
Can I connect this to a security monitor and/or vcr so that i can record too? also can it connect to a regular tv or maybe computer monitor?,"Possibly, but it is designed to be used with a cctv dvr and not a vcr. To hook up to a computer you would need a cctv add on card. They usually cost more than a stand alone cctv dvr."
What is the approximate degrees of the viewing angle on the camera?,55
Does the camera have a motion dector?,"Yes and no. It doesn't have a separate motion detector however the dvr will process a change in the image it sends as ""motion""."
What cable's do I need with these camera's?,you need the normal cctv wire simese cable rg59 bnc/ power
what is the size,It is a hand held fan it Is medium size not too big not too small. I use it to fan eyelash extensions ans it works great!
what are the dimensions of the fan,I would guess about 8 inches high? And 3 inches wide? I love it and want to order another:) I get compliments on it all the time!
What does the USB charge? Do I need to purchase rechargeable batteries?,I just use AA batteries.
Can I re-install this unit in my Ford Taurus after I've removed it from my now-scrapped Isuzu Rodeo? Will I need a new wiring harness or anything?,I have taken mine from vehicle to vehicle with no problem. Keep in mind you don't want to cut the wires too short on the radio because you lose a little bit of wiring each time you move from vehicle to vehicle when you cut the butt connections or however you made the connections to your vehicle. The answer is yes you can.
is compatible with a pontiac firebird?,"It's a single DIN device so if your stereo slot is single DIN or can be made to fit with some kind of adapter, than you're good. Note tho that there needs to be room above the car stereo slot for the touchscreen. The screen moves out of the unit and then pivots up. So whatever is directly above the car stereo slot will be obscured by the touchscreen. Having a heat vent blast at it would not be ideal."
will it fit in a 2001 toyota camry?,Yes
CAN we install this product in my dodge grand caravan 2002? thank you,Yes
is this radio compatible with my androided phone?,No
do it fit a dodge sprinter 2004 2500,It should

Does this sterio fit a Honda Element,As long as you buy the proper install kits/ din plates it should fit in anything
Will this device allow caller ID info through to my remote phones so I can see who's calling on the handset?,"By remote phones if you mean multiple telephones connected to a land line within your home, yes, it still allows caller ID to be displayed on them. But once a number is blocked, they will never ring so you won't be bothered with having to look at the caller ID to see who it is."
If a called is blocked you want how do you unblock it? My son calls and it blocks him...Thanks,click the blacklist button and go thru the blacklist until you find your sons phone number and click remove button that should remove his number from the blacklist.
Will this device block calls if the caller has blocked his number?,"If you have caller id service from your phone company, you probably have a feature you can enable called Anonymous Call Rejection. That feature will block any call that does not have a number associated with it. Then any call that comes through would have a number unless it is an ""out of area"" call. The T Lock, problems not withstanding, can block any number you put on the blacklist. Be aware of the following: Caller ID blocking ONLY WORKS FROM RESIDENCE TO RESIDENCE. Commercial users can retrieve your number with an ANI box even if you block your caller id. I got that surprise one day when a business I called for price and availability on a local number with my caller id blocked, called me back on my number to tell me that they found what I was looking for. What a shock and an education I got."
Can I use it in Brazil?,"I don't know. It does work on all land-line systems in North America, including VOIP. I hope this helps."
Can I block entire area codes?,"Yes you can block up to 10 area codes. 1. press 'SET' button. 2.lift handset, and press 5. 3 input area code ie '800'. 3. press up or down key to save. 4. Display will show 'saved' 4. Hangup"
Our phone company (Charter Communications) allows us to block for free only up to 12 numbers. Will this device allow us to block additional numbers?,It should have no effect on your phone provider's service. The device works from your home. It blocks the signal as it enters your home. Make sure that you read the instructions carefully and thoroughly.
Do the telephones ring at all if a blocked caller calls?,Yes. But only one ring.
Will this work on Verizon FIOS digital voice?,"Well I have FIOS telephone (Landline), Internet & TV package and I have Digitone Call Blocker Plus! and it works. It's all fiber optic, I think it's all the same. Ask the company, or when in doubt Google it out. Type in google search box T-lock Incoming PRO Call Blocker with LCD Display does it work on verizon digital voice."
Mine hangs up on everyone? How do I stop that?,"Quite likely you have inadvertently set a ""block all incoming calls"" condition. The easiest way to clear that is to unplug the PRO Call Blocker and reprogram the unit via the user manual. Unfortunately when the unit is unplugged, you will lose all the current blocked calls. But since all your calls are being blocked now, it might be the best solution. Here is the link to the manual: Please follow these step-by-step instructions: http://hqtelecom.com/T-Lock_Call_Blocker_User_Manual.pdf If you have questions, here are some answers: http://hqtelecom.com/faqs-pro-call-blocker-ver2-how-to-block-calls/ My unit is working fine and currently I block over 250 annoying calls."
I have Verizon wireless home phone connect. Will this unit work if I connect it to my system?,"I also use wireless for my home. The wireless broadcaster plugs into an old fashioned phone jack and communicates with 4 handsets. What I did was connect the phone blocker to a separate old fashioned phone jack (we have lots of them in the house), and it works despite the separately connected wireless broadcaster. When a blocked call comes in, the wireless broadcaster rings once before the blocker cuts off the blocked call. Can't tell you specifically about Verizon, but that's how it works at my my home. Hope this helps. Don"

"Hi, what does it mean ""Non-ECC CL11""? and Why other similar products does not say that?","""Short for Error-Correcting-Code memory, a type of memory that includes special circuitry for testing and accuracy of data as it passes in and out of memory."" Most home computers use standard memory, while ECC memory is used for commercial applications where data integrity is very critical. When buying memory, the only time you will see ECC mentioned is if the memory *is* ECC, not if it is *not* ECC. ECC memory is also more expensive since it has an extra memory chip and circuitry to do the error correction. Basically, the CL tells you how many clock cycles it takes to perform an action, so the less the better."
"Will it work with THINKPAD Edge 031925U, Serial#LR6GC0B?","depending on the model number, I would say yes, but to be certain go on line with your laptop. type in www.crucial.com. download the diagnostics that will tell you about your laptop. once it scans the memory ports through the BIOS, it will tell you what is needed. I believe that it will work."

"Hi, can I use 2 of these as upgrades in my HP notebook Model: 15-n211dx?","Hi Edem, The HP 15-n211dx notebook supports a maximum of 12GB of DDR3L-1600 memory. As such, it would only be able to take one 8GB module with one 4GB module to reach the maximum. Part KVR16S11/8 is a DDR3-1600 module and is not compatible since it is 1.5V and the notebook needs 1.35V (DDR3L). Part number KVR16LS11/8 is a DDR3L-1600 module and should work in that notebook.

I have an Asus M11BB desktop. Can you confirm that this memory will work with this computer? I'm 99% sure it will.,"No it will not. the M11BB can handle up to 16 GB of memory, but they need to be in 4 gig sticks, up to 4. This is an 8 gig stick, and the mother board will not recognize it, and my even refuse to power up with it on.

My computer runs windows 8.1 - do you think that has changed with a newer version?,"The OP (operating program) and the RAM (Random Access Memory) are not the same. RAM is where the program or any other 'working program' on your computer resides. When your computer 'BOOTS Up', it is taking a computer program from the hard drive and loading it onto the RAM. 'Windows 8.1' is the operating program that is loaded into (or onto) RAM and directs what takes place and how information that you type in under a 'prompt' or from an internal command derived from the program. TWO completely different things!"

I heard Kingston RAM is not VERY compatible with other brand's RAM. Does this issue ever happen to your PC? I want to add this RAM to my hp pc.,"Can only speak for myself, but I added it to my HP Pavilion Elite HPE and it has worked just fine since."
If it is compatible with the HP ENVY h8-1540t CTO Desktop PC,"One would have to go the the HP support website for this PC, or review the PC's manual, in order to identify compatible memory."

does it include a USB 3.0 port like the one in the picture?,"Nope , it only supports usb 2.0 unfortunately. The CoolerMaster Elite 431 Black / Blue Mid-Tower Gaming Case is designed to have one 3.o port along with two 2.o ports on the front so thats why the blue usb port shows in the pics. Don't let it fool you."
Would a Cooler Master 500W power supply be an adequate replacement for the power supply that comes with it?,"That shouldn't be necessary. If you had read through all of the reviews, it's been stated a few times, that the older power supply- which people were having problems with- has been replaced in this build."
Will it be able to run GTA IV and Arma 2?? Not on high graphics but decent enough!,I have those games personally and they run well enough.
Would I have to remove the graphics card that came with this or can I install another without removing it.,The motherboard can only hold 2 so its not mandatory.
can i use this pc to make and upload youtube videos,Yes . Up to 1080p
What graphics card would you recommend to upgrade to for about 100-150 bucks?,the nvidia gtx 650 with 1gb of ddr5 is a very nice card and it's only like 120 bucks. I would recommend that one over any other for your price range!
"Would you buy this? I'm looking to use it for Minecraft, steam games and recording (possibly), would it run well? FPS with rec / not with rec","You could easily build a gaming computer for this price with much better specs. Just look up ""$500 gaming computer build"" on google and some good stuff will pop up."
Can this run minecraft?,Yes. This will run it with everything maxed or medium.
"Can I install a removeable drive bay in this so that I can boot from different drives (Win7, Win 8, Linux, etc.)?","Yes, I have this pc and there are lots of open bays to install a SSD or HDD."
Is it good for gaming (eg. Skyrim),"Yes, I just bought it.. before buying it I did a lot of research bro and it can be run on low to mid settings maybe medium high. Haven't tried high. I also found this website: www.game-debate.com you put the specs of your pc and they tell you how much fps you can get and how can you run the game better etc.. Good luck :D"
Are the keys backlit on this machine?,The keys are NOT backlit.
"Does anyone who owns this know how it handles gaming, specifically Diablo 3?","Hello Micheal, this laptop is not idle for gaming. Don't get me wrong, it will handle games extremely well at low settings but forget about extreme. But for the price, its more than idle. However, if you can shell out a little more then get this HP dv6-6c50us (15.6-Inch Screen) Laptop and upgrade your ram with this Corsair Vengeance Laptop Memory Kit 16 GB (2x8 GB) DDR3 1600MHz CL10 PC3 12800 (CMSX16GX3M2A1600C10), I assure you will get one powerful budget laptop all for around 800 bucks, with a bluray combo drive as an added bonus. This combo will give you a windows experience index rating of 6.4 and 7.5 for gaming graphics and memory operations respectively. Note the max WEI rating is 7.9, so do the maths, believe me $1800 laptops don't have such ratings. Hope this helps."
no bluetooth????,No bluetooth
"When i put on sleep mode, later it does. not restart, i got to take out the battery to do that","hi, I must be a not good configuration of Windows because it should not do that, I suggest going to power setting and click Restore Default let me know anything else"
How do you remove bloatware from this laptop?,"Like all computer issues, there is more than on way to solve any problem! IMHO, the best thing to do, is 1) make a set of recovery disks, 2) make a copy of C:\SWSetup on a thumb drive, 3) re-partition the drive into 1 partition and 4) install a ""retail"" version of Windows 7."
Does it have a full version of Microsoft Office,"No, it only has the 'Office 2010 Starter"" program."
Is 6gb the max for ram or can you add more?,"No, I took mine out and added 16 gigabytes of Crucial memory."
can photoshop cs6 be used on this laptop?,"Yes, CS5 runs fine on this laptop so CS6 should be no issue."
Anyone successfully using this card with a 64 bit S Windows 8.1 system ?,The 600 series support Windows 8.1 64bits without any hassle. Download the latest drivers from the nvidia website after the proper installation. That's all you need.
what is the minimum power supply wattage needed for this card?,"Per the packaged box, 350 is the minimum wattage."
Will this be compatible with a Dell Inspiron 3847 Desktop?,I am using it with a Dell Inspiron 660
would this work for a macbook pro?,No. This is for a desktop PC.
Is this card compatible with an Acer AX1430G slim desktop?,"From the specs it seems to have a PCI Express x16 slot and a x1 slot, so it could theoretically fit a double slot video card, but the 220W power supply is going to be a problem. It won't be able to provide enough juice. So you're looking at upgrading the video card and the power supply (if it is upgradeable)."
Is this video card compatible with an ASROCK FM2A85X EXTREME?,I honestly don't know. Sorry
What type of expansion slot does it need? My PC has a PCIx16 (2.0) graphics slot. Will this work in it?,According to MSI website the card runs on the PCI Express x16 3.0 port. This will not work due to the card requiring a newer skit than the one you mentioned.
it works with laptop?,No it is way to big to fit any laptop and I'm pretty sure no laptop has the right connections for it to use.
Is this compatible with a Macbook?,"No, a macbook is a laptop"
is this card dx11 capable?,Yes it is :)
How do you watch hybrid 3D/2D disks with this Orei blu ray player? So far every 3D/2D hybrid disc won't switch over to 3D.,"Usually there is an option on the disc to watch the show in 3d. There are not too many hybrid discs - I know of only one that I have - most movies have a separate 3D disc. Shorter answer - you don't have to do anything on the player. Do other 3d discs work fine? If so, its an issue with the authoring on the hybrid disc, not the player"
Will Blu Ray Discs also play through the Composite Component A/V output jacks? Can I use a standard Composite Video TV to see blue ray discs?,"Yes, you may also play the Blu-ray discs and view them with the Composite outputs on your TV."
"What are the options for internet connections? built-in wifi, wifi usb, regular cord (ethernet?/lan)??","No built in wifi, USB he's and Ethernet cord yes, but I shipped mine back as I would not get it, it's not a region free blu ray player as it states, only plays region A and that's it, really disappointed and it feels cheaply made!"
Description says it supports BD-Live 2.0. But is it Bd-Live 2.0 ready? Or do I have to install software?,It is ready
"Is this a multi-region blu ray/dvd player? If so, do the regions have to be switched manually for blu-rays and are instruction for this included?",All regions are automatic for DVD. They must be switched manually for blu. Mine did not come with instructions or the code to switch it. I found it after some searching on line. I also posted the new code in the reviews. Hope this helps.
Is it true that the newest firmware does not support all region blu ray? Region B disc doesn't play?,It accepts all Blu-Ray regions. You need to look in the user manual to switch the Blu-Ray Region manually. It switches automatically for DVDs. So yes it play region B but you need to switch it manually.
Is this product including linking cables? like HDMI cable.,No. The only cable included is an RCA cable.
Does this player also work for standard DVD&acute;s? The product name only says Blu Ray Player.,"Yes, it will. It can play multiple region formats for both DVD and BluRay."
Does this player come with a remote control? I didn't notice any statement saying that it does. Thanks.,"Yes, when I bought it - it came with a remote. Very limited on it's functions however. No slow play and you have to use the remote to open/close the player. Mine won't open/close using the buttons on the dvd player itself."
orei bluray region A B C,My Orei Player does not play region B discs. Only plays Region A.
Will this fit the RX100 MKII?,"It does, provided you don't want to flip down the screen. Unfortunately the side of the case gets in the way of this happening. I didn't notice the problem for a week or so, but I think I'm going to return it as I find tilting the screen to be too useful a feature to give up. Otherwise it's a very nice case."
"Can this case fit over the Sony grip accessory? It doesn't look like it can, but ideally, I would buy both. Has anyone tried?",No there is no room for grip. The case fits very snug to the camera and it looks like you'd need a 1/2 inch clearance for the grip. I've used the camera now for 6 months and there is no need for a grip IMO. I love the case.
Can you articulate the screen on the MII while it is in the case?,Sure you can
is it the one with the inscription sony in black on the shoulder strap?,I believe so as mine does have Sony pressed into strap.
can you get to the battery to charge without removing case?,"Yes, there is an opening on the side of the case and you can open the battery charge door. You do not get to the battery. To charge you plug into the side of the camera."
Is it possible to attach a lens adapter ring on the front and still keep it in the case?? obviously not adding the filter itself.,From the tight fit of the case it will be tough.
Is the case only black,"I'm not sure if you mean if it comes in other colors or if the case itself is completely black. As far as I know, you can find the same model case in tan as well, but from another company/seller. And yes, the case itself is completely black with black lining and I am very satisfied with it."
Does it have loop for a belt?,No.
what psu would you need for this?,"250 watts will not cut it unless you are only trying to run the GPU (and you won't be). You need headroom. For this card, you would need at least 450 watts, but I would suggest at least 700 so as not to overtax your power supply. An overtaxed PSU will give you nothing but headaches (such as fried cpus or motherboards)."
Will this card run DayZ and/or CS:GO on Medium/High settings?,CS:Go handles just fine on high but Dayz may require lower settings to get reasonable fps.
Will this work on a hp p6-2143w. does it require extra plugin for power?,Yes
Will this work on a hp p6-2143w. does it require extra plugin for power?,Yes
will it work with pcie x16 gen 2,"Yes it will. There is a slight performance drop associated with not using PCIE 3.0 but its negligible. I use it in 2.0 myself, works great"
Will this fit on my motherboard(fm2-a75ma-e35)?,Very well!
Will this be compatible with http://www.amazon.com/ASRock-processo...,I think so you might want to read the book to just make sure that is compatible
will this fit/work on a dell optiplex 755 sff ?,All depends on what type of ports it has on the PC. Lookup in google for tech spec on your PC.
Had this gpu for about a year and a few months and im idling at 70 Deg. Celsius can someone tell me why? im g2 leave a bad review,Did you clean it? There is probably a cake of dust on it.
Would this card fit in a Gateway AMD E 1 Vision,I have mine in a gateway it is a pretty large card though
Does this work for PCI Express x16 or 2 PCI Express x1 slots??? Also is it good for low to mid gaming? Thanks.,I would say low end gaming. I'm using it on a work computer to speed up a 3d mapping software. The only game I have run on that pc is Minecraft with some of the up end mods on it.
Is this card an upgrade to an NVIDEA GT610 1 GB DDR3?,"The short answer is, yes but mostly for the additional VRAM. The chip itself isn't much better. Within a series, it's easy to tell what you are getting based on price. NVIDIA 6 series cards (610,620,...650,660,670) get better as you go up in number. And the price goes up as well. It's harder to compare outside of a series. For example an old 260 will outperform a 620. The second number represents the power, and the first number represents the generation. So the 260 is four generations older but it's way higher in the power number. This is a pretty basic answer, but hope it helps."
64 bit?? Is this product for 64 bit? The description leaves room to question.,"yes, it works on 64 bit, i have it installed in my tower and it works great."
Will this card work on a hp model a6530f that has a M2N68-LA (Narra3) motherboard and a 300watt psu,"Cannot help you with an answer to that, don't want to smoke your computer. You might go to the Nvidia site and see what the power requirements are and then check the motherboard web site to see what they say. Also see if Nivida has an 800 number you can call. Sorry that I can't be of more help to you."
will this card work with a dell optiplex 755 computer?,If your computer has a pci express slot and windows OS. It will work.
will thi s run in a dell vostro 200 slim tower??????,"No its to thick, had size issues in my regular tower. Had to rearrange wires to get it in"
will it fit in the dell inspiron 660's ?,"I cannot answer for a Dell Machine. I used it on an MSI motherboard in a MSI case that I put together for myself. You need to know if your motherboard has a PCI- I cannot answer for a Dell machine. I used this video card on a MSI motherboard in a MSI case that I put together for myself. If you have a slim line Dell it will not fit. If you have a standard Dell case and a PCI-e 2.0 slot in the motherboard then it should fit. Works great, good video."
I have a Intel HD Graphics 4600 card on my computer. Will using the MSI NVIDIA create any conflicts?,There is insuffient information here to answer your question Fredrick. My Intel graphics is built into the motherboard and is automatically disabled when a e16 card is installed. But there is nothing - as far as I can see - to stop me from installing a second card (i.e. PCI). One reason I chose the specific NVIDIA card was because it allowed a second display. Hope this helps. Alex
Will it fit &amp; work in a Lenovo H520S,The factory-installed video card is one model number higher (GT 630) than this card. Not sure why you would want to downgrade (slightly). I can't answer the question given that the machine is small-form factor. You should refer to the user manual and/or contact Lenovo support. http://download.lenovo.com/consumer/desktop_pub/lenovo_h5s_ug_v2.0_aug_2012_english.pdf
Will this work on my Dell Optiplex 740?,I wanted to put this in my optiplex 640 but I didn't realize until I tried to install it that the computer is such a budget machine that the slot it was supposed to mount in was not actually installed to the motherboard. Otherwise I think it would have.
can i connect my iphone to a tv with the proper cables and watch the program on tv that would normally show on my phone...like netflix for iphone,"The Bekin TV streams the TV content to the Apple device. I think you are asking to stream from the Apple device to the TV. In that case, just get an Apple TV. Note, the newest Apple TV box only streams 1080p, so you need a newer high resolution TV to do this. Older Apple TV's will stream at lower resolutions for older TV's."
Does this work with Kindle tablets?,"Yes,, it does.. I have it on a Nook color, nexus 7 and razr cell phone.. and have tested it on a Kindle of a friend of mine and it works fine."
Does this have an App for Windows so I can watch on my laptop while away from home?,"Yes, there is software you can download from Belkin and install on your computer. This software allows you to configure the device as well as watch streamed tv from the device. http://www.belkin.com/us/support-article?articleNum=4211"
does it work with moxi dvr,"Sorry, but I was not able to get it to work at all! I sent mine back."
"Can you use with a TV as opposed to a laptop, phone or iPad?",No but you can connect your laptop or ipad to your tv and watch it that way.
has anyone tried this with an android phone or tablet? Is there a cost for the apps for the tablet or android phone and if so how much?,Android tablet app is free. Phone is $12.99. Both work fine for me but you'll want to be connected to a wifi network or on at least a 4G network. 3G performance generally is choppy at best.
"Has anyone encountered a problem where the @tv player says that belkin @tv device is not responding, but the device is actually up an running? Thanks.","When this happens to me, I just hit ok or cancel and then try again. This usually works. What I would suggest is an email to the Belkin tech/support team. Unlike a previous comment, I've found them responsive and their suggestions usually work."
Would I be able to download the app to my iphone 4 and stream tv over my verizon 3g network?,"Yes. The app is about $10. On 3g looks ok, 4g would be better but the most important thing is to have a good signal."
Does this stream 720p from a component connected cable box to LAN or local WIFI devices? Can it stream 720p to the internet?,Yes. The signal will be a lot clearer. It is recommended that you connect both the component (HD) and composite cables. This will allow to select various resolutions from low to high.
component or composite which is better,"Component is Hi Def. Composite is not. Composite is for non Hi Def Tv. However, some Hi Def TV's do not have Component, just HDMI."
What are the dimensions on this battery?,Look at the model number on the bottom of your APC. That should tell you what battery to order when you look at the battery descriptions on Amazon.
Will this work with an APC ES350 Model BE350G?,"Looks same, but can't be sure, but there is a battery listed for BE350G, you may try that http://www.amazon.com/BACK-UPS-BE350G-Replacement-UPS-Battery/dp/B0077QLLVC/ref=pd_sim_e_6"
"I am looking for a replacement battery that will work to replace the battery in my APC UPS ES 350 which is a BP3-12 (13V 3AH/20HR). The dimensions of the original battery are 5 1/4"" x 2 3/8"" x 2 5/8"". The terminals are 1/4"" wide. Can you please send me...",The BE350r I bought from amazon fit your numbers and it replaced battery in APC UPS es series.
will this work for BE350R?,"Sorry, I don't know. Our backup is an APC UPS ES 350, and it works great for us..."
"I am looking for a replacement battery that will work to replace the battery in my APC UPS ES 350 which is a BP3-12 (13V 3AH/20HR). The dimensions of the original battery are 5 1/4"" x 2 3/8"" x 2 5/8"". The terminals are 1/4"" wide. Can you please send me...",Amazon offers several compatible options. I am using one now...
"Vendor claims dimensions are 6 x 2.6 x 3.7. When I checked the OEM batt for my APC UPS ES550, it is exactly 5.88 x 2.5 x 3.63. How well does this fit?",The battery I received went in without issues.
I ordered the UB1280 battery from RU (MH20567). I received the Vision SCP1280F2--are they the same?,"The key info with respect to the battery capacity here is the 1280 (which translates to 12V 8.0 AH). Whether or not the batteries are equivalent (and will work in your application) will come down to the physical dimensions and location of the positive/negative terminals. Sometimes the batteries may be electrically equivalent, but you need to be careful about the dimensions of the case. Be extra careful of the location of the terminals to make sure that the positive/negative are on the proper sides for your use."
is this replacement compatible with the APC 500?,"Yes. The only downside is purchase directly from APC used to include a return mailing label to recycle the battery. That is not included from this supplier, which makes the over all purchase inconvenient. However, APC does not offer this replacement battery anymore. So, what are you to do?"
"I don't need a replacement battery at this time. If I buy this battery now and keep it in storage, how many years would the battery still be usable when I need to use it when my old battery dies?","Less than a year. Sealed lead acid batteries need to be kept on charge or else they undergo something called sulfation, which is terminal to the battery. Buying one ahead of time and storing it is a bad idea."
What are the dimensions? Is it the size of a pen over 3-inches?,the pen is 4 inches long. Yes over 3 inches.

"Do you really think that i need to buy a kit of 2 of these memory? I have a Macbook pro 2012 with 4 GB of RAM,","It is not necessary to install DDR3 memory sticks in pairs, however you will experience much better performance if you do because DDR3 memory is optimized to operate twice as fast in dual channel mode in matched pairs, as is your current configuration. Although the 2012 MacBook Pro has an ""official"" 8GB limit it can actually address 16GB. You will get much faster performance by upgrading to 8GB using two matched 4GB sticks rather than installing just one 8GB stick with the existing 2GB stick. Why upgrade memory capacity but downgrade performance by installing only one stick?"
I know 2 + 8 is doable but will this Kingston pair ok with the Apple 2GB chip? OWC said their 8GB would but it cost about $20 more.,"Yes. Easy to install and makes the mac work faster,"
"Does it work on 17-inch Macbook Pro, Midsummer 2012 model?",I used for Mac mini 2013 and 2012 and it works perfectly fine.

"I am trying to find a camera that takes extremely clear pictures...I have had other Sonys, Canons, Nikons etc. and none are as clear as I would like. I have a Pentax 645N and it takes the clearest pictures of any camera I have ever had. To people who...","The Sony RX100 is the best compact around for the time being (and you can now go for the RX100 II for which they added some nice and useful goodies) if not considering kind of compact cameras with fixed lenses with a fixed focal distance (no zoom) as the Nikon Coolpix A. But if the image quality of the RX100 is not enough for you, forget about compact cameras and try with a semi-compact with a bigger sensor, for example, something as the Sony NEX 7. If that does not still fulfill your expectations, you can always go for a full-frame or you could spend about 7.000 U$S and update to the Pentax 645D (which is a medium format camera). You can always check and compare camera sensor ratings done (benchmarked) by DxOMarks for different cameras, at this site http://www.dxomark.com/index.php/Cameras/Camera-Sensor-Ratings"
does the rx100 come with a battery charger or does that have to be ordered separately?,You can charge the battery in the camera with the included cable. You can buy a plug-in charger with one or two spare batteries (non-Sony) if you want backup batteries.
Does this camera come with an instruction manual?,"It comes with a small guide to help you set it up. Things like how to insert the battery, the SDHC card and how to charge it. The full user guide is available as a download from the web. There is also various settings menus that are available on the camera it self."
What brand is the included 32G class 10 SD card?,"I think mine was a Sony as shown in the picture. All items top quality, but the case is pretty useless. I changed to a Sony case and am very happy with the whole package and the camera is great!"
"Can it work with a remote shutter release? If, yes, what kind?","I don't believe this version does--it doesn't mention it in the camera manual or list a compatible one on their website. I use the self-timer, and there is a ""smile shutter"" function where the shutter will fire when the subject of your portrait smiles (and you can even set the ""level"" of smile on three different degrees.) and there is a bulb setting to keep the shutter open, but not with a remote. The newer versions, II and III, have a remote cable release (RM-VPR1) that seems to plug into the side of the camera."
How do u get the battery in the extra battery charger. They dont seem to go together.,The battery charger (that I received) is in 2 parts. You must insert the smaller part (of the charger) into the larger part (the one with the cord) The battery should snap into this smaller part. Why they made it this way is unclear to me.
The description displays a 64GB memory card and battery charger. Are these items actually included in the purchase?,"Yes, I got everything pictured when I placed my order."
What is in a new Sony rx10011m box besides the camera?,"There qas all this stuff in the picture. Because the pack becomes cheap, I believe it is worth just for the extra battery and the memory card!"
110 and 220,"You charge the camera using a USB cable that will plug into your computer or a wall charger (with a USB connection). You'll have to check the specifications, but I'm confident it can be either 110 or 220 v for the wall unit. It's a wonderful camera."
Does this include a manufacturer's warranty? If so how long does it last and what are the terms to make it applicable?,"Sony provides a Limited Warranty (US) for 1 year from the original date of purchase of the product. If you need more information, log onto www.sony.com/support."
What is this? So: PC&gt;[HD-Link]&gt; --------------------Ethernet Cable-----------------&gt;[HD-Link]&gt;----... Cable------------&gt;TV.? When these are connected and powered then I play the movie in PC and watch on my TV?,"No, these are to pass an HDMI signal over CAT 5/6. If you had HDMI out on your computer you could do that. These basically allow long distance runs of HDMI."
"if I currently have an existing cat5 wire run for telephone, will I be able to use the single cat5 wire for both phone and (extended) internet?",No. This device needs a full Cat5e/6 cable.
Would it be Compatible with Powerline Networking? Does it encapsulate data with ethernet frames so it can be used in routing?,"These do not pass ethernet or ARC. These are not 1.4 compliant. As far as powerline ethernet. I have never used in that fashion, but given what I know about both technologies I highly doubt it would work."
Has anyone run this at least 100' at 1080p 60hz with no signal drop?,I ran this at 100' with no problems using cat5e but my source was a directv box that was outputting 1080i most of the time.
Resolution wise are you able to do resolutions like 1024x768? Alot of our clients still use 1024x768 and the other boxes i bought don't play well.,Yes it does play 1024x768. Haven't had any issues with it
Does this unit work using a switch or a router ? or it must have direct connection CAT 5e/6 cables?,"Nope. In fact, I couldn't get it to work with an out-of-the-box 5e cable, tho most seem to have accomplished that feat."
Does this create a lag in the video signal?,I haven't noticed any lag whatsoever in our system.
Is this a way so you can send the computer's active image to a tv over hdmi? Somewhat like chromecast by google?,This could be used to send a computers active image to a more remote TV (or monitor) provided: 1. the source computer has an HDMI output (or output that can be converted to HDMI); 2. there is an available (i.e. unused for any other purpose) single CAT5 cable that runs from the source computer to the remote TV; and 3. the remote TV has an HDMI input (or input that can be converted to HDMI).
"Does this need direct connection or can it be connected with a router or switch in the way? In my application, the CAT5e is not connected directly.",Unfortunately it is direct connection. You need to find HDBaseT products for what you're looking for. Good luck!
Does power supply support 220v power?,No. Only 110vac
would this work in dell optiplex 745 minitower even though my motherboard says its pci express 1.0 and this card says PCI Express 2.0?,"Yes, PCI-E 2.0 is backward compatible to PCI-E 1.0; however, you will not get full performance from it. With the price point on this the way it is, you reduction in performance is probably not a big deal. I would caution against using modern video cards with older power supplies. Generally, for modern graphics cards a 500W p/s is a minimum starting point--I would not go under 400W."
"I have an HP m8457c Pavilion running windows 8, 8 gigs of ram, my system is old and runs on DDR2 but has a PCIe Express 2 x 16 will the GT630 operate",I don't see any reason why it wouldn't work with that setup. I have the GT630 in a Windows 7 machine and it runs great.
Is this compatible with the Dell Dinsion E520 Thanks in advance!,Check out your spec's at Dell and then compare with NVidia site http://www.geforce.com/hardware/desktop-gpus/geforce-gt-630/specifications The main thing is to be sure you computers Power supply is sufficient. This card requires a minimum of 300 Watts.
Could this be of any use for gaming? I can play BF4 already on med settings but I'd like to also play GTA 5 when it's out I dont mind if its on low s,I play crysis 3 at high settings so I believe GTA would be fine from a purely graphics card aspect.
hollo. i have motherboard ASRock H55M-LE (RTL) LGA1156 . will this graphic card completable ?,"As long as you have a PCI-Express slot, yes. I forget now, but this card either uses PCI-E 2, or 3. If it is 3, then running it in a 2.0 will bottleneck your card (Not too badly, though). Otherwise, not a problem. I can't find your motherboard model anywhere, otherwise it'd be very short."
what are the demensions of the card?,Product Dimensions: 11.7 x 2 x 8.3 inches
this is a two part question. One. can this card work in a gigabite GA-965P-DS3 motherboard? Two. If I decided to up grade parts can this card be run Sli/ crossfire,"http://www.gigabyte.com/products/product-page.aspx?pid=2456#ov http://www.gigabyte.com/products/product-page.aspx?pid=4217#ov I don't know, but the links to Gigabyte may help."
"pci-e 2.0, box say 3.0?","What I see on the box says it is compatible with 3.0 motherboard, which means it's backward compatible. Should be just fine pci-e 2.0."
I was wondering does this graphics card have a VGA connector port for a monitor?,Yes it does
is this card good for high quality gaming like planetside 2 or battlefield 3,I am using it for video editing..and it works ok..and I dont think its for high end video games...and I dont play or use for video games...but it works well with Alien Shooter and Trans Ascend
Does anyone know if this will work via Wii U?,This is made for computers. You wouldn't need this for a Wii U because it's already backwards compatible with original Wii controllers. You would just plug your classic controller into the Wii remote.
Does this work for Minecraft on PC? What about games on Steam?,"Minecraft doesn't have native controller support, as of 1.6.2 at least. In my experience, Super Street Fighter IV AE, most emulators, and Cave Story+ can work natively as long as you plug it in before starting the game; just make sure to bind all of your controls to buttons. For games that use Xinput (used by games for native Xbox 360 controller support), use 360ce to fool them into thinking your Wii controller is a 360 pad; just be aware that it involves .dll files, which VAC doesn't like when they're played with when it comes to some games. For games that don't have any kind of good controller support, your next best bet is a program that translates controller input into keybindings and/or mouse movement. Xpadder is one such program."
"How exactly do you get this to work? My computer recognizes the device and I'm trying to use it for Dolphin, but I can't get it actually work.","You probably have to go into the settings and map the buttons individually. If that doesn't work, try putting the controller into the other port on the adapter."
is this cord have a USB Male adapter on it ? In other words will this adapter fit into a USB port ?,Yes. It is a type A Male USB connector
Does this adaptor work on PS3 with the WII U Mad Catz Tekken Tag Tournament 2 Arcade FightStick Tournament Edition?,"The adapter is designed to be connected to a computer, not a PS3. I do not have a PS3 so I couldn't try it to see if it would even be recognized. My guess is no."
Stopped working on Mac after working fine a few months. Any ideas?,"Try on another computer system, to see if you can get it working there. This can rule in or out an issue with your MAC."
Will this work with guitar hero guitars?,"No it only works with controllers that have the classic controller adapter, as you can see on the picture. It does not interface with a wii-mote at all."
Does this work with the new wii u hori pads?,"If the controller connects into the Wii Remote, then I would assume so. IF you are talking about the new controllers modeled after Gamecube Controllers, then they should definitely work, since they act like classic controllers."
"What emulators are best compatable for this converter? Currently using zsnesw &amp; wanting to use it for racing games like granturismo, will it work fine","I've tried ZSNES and Winkawaks, I'll dare to say that will work fine with MAME, is plug and play, so all the buttons and sticks are ready to use as soon as you plug the Classic controller to the adaptor, I also have a PCEngine emulator but haven't tested it yet, but I'm sure it will work too."
Will this controller work on an android phone (running 4.2.2 jelly bean) via a USB female to Micro USB male adapter?,I just tested connecting it to my Galaxy Tab S 8.4 running KitKat 4.4.2 and it doesnt work. I dont have a device running 4.2.2 but I doubt the result would have been different.
iphone 5,I assume you would like to know if this works with the iphone 5. Nothing like taking a moment to properly ask a question eh? Here is your answer: adapter
What is the difference from the old version to the new version?,"Bluetooth and lightning connector but keep in mind, iPhone 5 can still be connected with adapter or aux. input on older (cheaper) model"
Silly question: How do I turn stereo off? Pressing or pressing &amp; holding sends it to standby+demo mode so lights stay on. I have to unplug to turn o,Then it off with the remote. Then hit the display button on the remote. That turns off the lights while the speaker is off.
Is there a loss of sound/bass when using the RCA connectors compared to docking or the USB?,"I never tried the usb but I noticed bass loss when using rca cables, when it happens I turn it off and turn it back on and it goes back to normal, but it's annoying,"
It has AUX port? i would like to connect my PC to this dock,"It has RCA connectors (red/white a/v jacks) so that won't be a problem. I have my system hooked up to it. Just make sure to get a min jack to RCA cord, or whatever is appropriate for you system."
Can you play CDs on this?,"no, only mp3s and ipods."
does it have a rechargeable battery ? or it has to always be plugged in ?,"Hi Amir C., this Sony RDH-GTK33iP uses 120 V AC for power and doesn't have a battery pack. -Ely"
Does this system have bluetooth or is it easy to use with droid phones?,No bluetooth. And it's for old version iPod. But it has aux inputs and USB.
does it work with andriod,IPhone products only . But it will work with android if you use a speaker audio jack and use your phone . It's pretty loud. If you buy the one with built-in wi-fi you can use any device .
is the connector for iphone 5 or 4 ?,It is for the iPhone 4. I use an adapter which solves the issue
Does it come with Microsoft word?,Nope
This laptop have warranty?,"Comes with Dell's standard limited warranty as a new product as far as I know. However there is a note under product description on Amazon, saying that ""Has manufacturer's limited warranty until 11/2013"". Which is puzzling to me. You may want to call Dell and clearify this issue."
Do you know if there is a firewire connector or slot?,"No there is no firewire port on here - most computers today (past two years have removed firewire). Built in audio is excellent for a laptop - There are only 3 USB ports that's the only downside - but you can be very, very cheaply usb hub - other then that I highly recommend this laptop for the money"
how long is the warranty?,2 years
can I burn CD'S on this Laptop?,It comes with optical drive which you can burn CD or DVD.
Does this have Vaio Movie Maker Software? Thanks!,Yes
"Is this laptop an i3, i5, or i7?",The SVF1421ACXB has an Intel Pentium 2117U processor. - Glenn
is this a guaranteed new computer?,This laptop is brand new with factory seal. Thanks.
does the cd drive work on this computer?,Yes it's work
Can I get this computer with either Windows 7 or Windows 7 Professional instead of Windows 8?,This laptop comes with Windows 8. Thanks.
Does this have a DVD drive?,I cant answer this question because i have to return the computer. Battery wasnt working
Will this case fit an iPad 3?,"Hi Todd, I don't think it will :("
how in the world do you get the i-pad 2 to fit in the case??,"They actually work very well to keep the iPad safe it is 2 pieces that snap together. They are great for allowing kids to use the iPad without damage, but for an adult to use to take to work not a very professional look. I only use them for my kids iPads."
Does this case fit the iPad 4 with Retina Display?,I dont think so I bought it for a gift for a i pad 2
Does this fit the Kindle 3rd generation w/keyboard?,"The 3rd Gen is a VERY different design than the Kindle Fire, so I highly doubt it would fit."
does this fit the kindle fire hd 7 inch? or is it just for the original kindle fire?,It fits the standard fire perfectly so I'm thinking it will not fit the HD. I think they are different sizes.
Does this have a screen protector?,"There is no screen protector, but the case itself stops the screen from touching a surface when laid flat on its face. My understanding is that the Fire screen is not glass like the iPad but a more scratch resistant plastic, so a screen protector may not be necessary. But any good case should give a buffer if laid flat - this does but many do not"
Is this a hard case similar to the otter box that will protect against water and dropping?,"It is a similar style case from what I can tell it is three pieces altogether a front and black hard plastic case and a pink silicone case that wraps over that and seals it...I haven't spilled anything on it yet, but it seems protective enough for regular wear (and kid proofing) I have an otter box on my phone and it has the same feel to me :) hope that helps!"
I am just checking does this fit a Kindle Fire HD 2013? Many Thanks,It doesNOT fit
will this fit any other 7 inch tablet,"Yes, I love my case. It makes my kindle feel heavier, that's the only drawback."
Does this come with any screen protector?,no sadly it does not but its still protective
Does this fit kindle fire hd,I have no idea I just ordered my kids the regular kindle fires is has a spot in the front for a camera so imagine it would
Are these bulbs 120v?,"Yes, they are 120v"
Are these bulbs meant only for photography needs or can I use them in my garage. Would they last for couple years if used 5-6 hours a day continously?,I think they would work great for garages I use them in my grow room and I run them for 12-20 hrs a day and they work great
Maybe this is a stupid question but will these work on 220V South America?,No you will burn up the internal ballast if you feed it more than 120 volts
Is there anything that I can get to mount this to my ceiling ?,"They are a standard light bulb screw size so they should fit in any standard (E27) socket you already have. However they are longer than a normal bulb, so if your light fixture has a cover or something, you may need to check for clearance issues."
I wanted to order some of these and several other products but you dont ship to New Zealand? Can this be sorted out?,"We do not offer international shipment service at this time. Regards, kimoutlet"
What is the expected life of each bulb in hours?,I can say i have used one bulb for at least 25 hours and it is still running great
How many lumens?,I do not know how to measure the lumins however in comparison to other bulbs of same kalvin and watts they are a little less in light output
"Are these ""full spectrum?"" Can they be used as grow lights? do they simulate a soft, white light or iridescent? Is the light natural looking?","These are full spectrum. The intended use is in a photo studio, I'm not sure if they could be used as grow lights, but I would think its a realistic application. These simulate sunlight. 'Natural' would be a subjective term. Since they're fluorescent they cast a slightly bluish green."
"Perhaps a silly question, but do these work only on the American power system, or could they be screwed into a European lamp and work over there too?",hi my friend im sorry but i dont have idea if they do or not we run are electricty on 110w i know my family in italy they run 220 the best i can tell you is go to a hardware store and ask sorry my name is johnny my eamil wise_guys2000@yahoo.com
Will these fit a standard table lamp? I'd love to use them for my vanity lamp.,Yes indeed. Standard size socket. Iusg say that several of these bulbs failed quickly.
"I would like to use them in a school setting, my concern is how many concurrent connections will they support. if you have 20 kids with ipads in a room with this work?","Hi Theresa, I installed 6 of the pro series in a school. We have 30 mac books connected at once to 1 AP with no issues whatsoever. I can't imagine that iPad would be any different. You can call me at 914-946-0100 to discuss in more detail if you like. Thanks, Eric"
Does this support zero handoff?,Yes it does they call it Roaming. You can read more about it here http://dl.ubnt.com/guides/UniFi/UniFi_AP_AP-LR_User_Guide.pdf
Can you have multiple ssids?,Yes you can set up 4.
What is the second Gbn connection for? The documentation on the ubiquiti site only says that the second Gbn is for bridging. Any details?,"The secondary port simply acts like an additional switchport to which you can connect a (non-POE) device, such as an IP camera. It is a bridged port and is non-configurable. It cannot be used for link aggregation."
Can someone explain why we need to set a generic master SSID for this AP? Normally we determine an SSID for each radio band and guests... Tks!,"You can set a regular and guest SSID individually for each AP you manage and for each radio. If you go into the AP configuration, you can override the SSID for each radio for normal and Guest."
Can you disable SSID Broadcast in this unit? Thank you.,Yes.
DOes this unit come with the POE power unit as well? Thanks!,It does come with an inline ethernet power adapter if your switch is not a POE model.
What comes in the box with this Ubiquti. Do i need my own network cables etc?,"As I recall, just the mounting hardware. This is an enterprise product so it would generally mounted high on a wall or ceiling (which is why it has the design shape it does), It is (quite reasonably, IMHO) assumed that it is going to be a permanent, wired-in solution and in that case you would most likely be running a long Cat5/6 cable to it from your router thru the walls and/or ceiling. If you do not have the ability to do this, a simpler shelf mounted unit might be better for your use. Worth the effort if you can install it as getting access points up high results in better coverage in most places. It also looks cool, like a large smoke detector with a glowing blue ring."
how difficult is the setup process for this device?,"Our IT guy set it up, but he said it was much easier to configure than others. It works better than the one we had before too."
Does it support MAC address filtering for the wireless clients? Can't find it in the instructions.,"No, but you can ""block"" any wireless client with the click of the mouse, which accomplishes the same thing, and unblock just as easily."
How many shows can it record at once?,Two
"What kind of program information does the TiVO provide? Can you find original airdate, actors, episode name, etc from this like you can on the HR24?",Yes
"Is this going to be automatically commandered by Direct TV once it is activated? In other words, will they own it?Thanks","No, you will own the receiver. DirectTV will charge you $5/month for usage on top of your monthly bill"
Does it require a phone connection?,"No it does not. It receives its information off the satellites. It can benefit from an internet connection (which can be wireless) for on-demand services, but it is not required for standard satellite service."
"If I activate on this my account, will I be required to extend my contract another 2 years and, even though I'll own it, will DirecTv say it's theirs?","The short answer is yes. You only own it, DirecTV will charge monthly for the privilege of activation and only do so with a two year contract. If you are going to do it, do it now before AT&T owns it as rate hikes are slated if the gov't allows buyout."
Can it control an attached AM21 and record OTA programs from it?,"My neighbor and I both have the same unit, the THR22. The AM21 works great, just not with the THR22. The THR22 still records from local via sat. Also, if you cancel service, like neighbor did, the THR22 unit becomes doorstop and usb stops working also. Directv would not add it to my account even though neighbor paid for unit outright. I haven't tried it since last year, but in any event Tivo has a much better than average cust knowledge base, unlike DIRECTV worth calling. I still have DIRECTV and like it, so I'm not slamming them perse. IN any event, my conversations with both companies informally leads me to believe that Directv really does not care to much for Tivo and the two units are not supported together. I have no doubt that some hack somewhere might have cracked them to work together, but it would probably violate several state and federal laws in the process. Call Tivo and ask them."
"Right now I have the DTV multi room genie set up with HR24 for head unit, will this new TiVo work with existing wiring? Thanks","I have a genie going to four rooms with Tivo to two more. You will need to add a switch at the point of wiring to get the Tivo unit to work also ( so that it has a separate feed to the dish). If you just plug it in where a c41-700 network box is it will not work. If you are replacing the Genie, then it will work. Network availability, just like the Genie is also required for proper functioning. Hope it helps."
Will directv charge hd fees if i buy this?,"Yes, they do"
"Since this is Tivo, would I need to pay Tivo's monthly service charge? I already pay directv monthly for their DVR service.",If you have both a directv dvr and TiVo then yes. Cheaper to have only one or the other . Have you seen new monster TiVo? Expensive but huge dvr capacity!
"So, wait, do I have to pay a fee to Tivo AND an extra fee to direcTV?",1 fee to dtv
does this tablet comes wifi ready or do I need a data service?,It is wi-fi ready
"I am concerned that one said the Wifi ""sucked."" Is this b/c it is lacking the use of 5GHZ band--the ""a"" standard in the ""802.11 a? b/g/n? Help!",Utll all depend on your level of wifi speed. The tablet works fine with good broadband
Can I put a micro sd card?,"Yes, the S2109 will accept a micro SD card up to 32 GB."
Is the Google Apps Store available?,"yes, it's called play store and preloaded with the machine."
does it have buildin keyboard,"If you mean keyboard on the screen, yes. There is no seperate keyboard"
Does it come with a charger?,"Yes, it come with a charger and plastic cover"
Does it have one or two cameras?,"one camera, front facing only. The camera is very bad quality."
Can I use and HDMI / VGA adapter so I can use it to play videos for my students?,"You need the convertor adaptor to do so.....I done it before for HDMI, but never try VGA."
bluetooth?,Bluetooth ok Wifi sucks
Are these compatible with samsung galaxy S4?,"Yes, it is compatible. I pair it with my galaxy S4 with Spotify, Pandora, and tuneIn radio."
How does it compare to the QC20i?,I'm not familiar with that model. However I am totally happy with the PS210. It has great active noise reduction and good sound quality. I'd buy it again
cancelling,Excellent noise cancelling
What chargers work for this thing? I don't always carry my laptop around...would I be ok using a 1A or 2A USB charger?,"Hi Alex, Any available USB power will work. I charge mine using my computer, a phone charger, or even the USB port on a printer."
does it work on iphone 5,Yes it does.
does this pair with the iphone 4? I'm worried about the bluetooth 3.0 being incompatible...,There shouldn't be any problem. I understand they are backward compatible. I'm extremely pleased with my Phiaton PS and would highly recommend it anyone looking for the best unit available at this time.
These headphones seem to have a noticeable electronic whine when not playing music but with active NC on...is this normal?,"Active noise cancelation without no sound to work with will add an artificial humming noise, but at very low tone. Is it noticable yes? Is it normal yes? Should it be noticable with music, no. This is common with all active noise reducing headphones. However, I would not describe this as a whine. But a very low toned air flowing hum almost like wind blowing through a very light hum."
"Can you pair with multiple bluetooth devices at the same time, like phone and laptop for example?",I'm not sure. I only have my phone that I pair with. My son used it once with his phone and I had to pair it again with my phone when he gave it back. Hope this helps.
"can you turn off noise cancelling and music to talk with someone briefly like ""Sony's talk through feature","Hi rick. Not sure what Sony has, but you have an on/off switch for noise cancelling and can pause your music with another button. However there is no actual need to switch off the noise cancelling, as this let conversation pass. It can cancel certain types of noise"
Will the ear buds connect to a MacBookPro? Thanks.,"I don't know, but I have mine paired to my Ipad."
Can you disable the fan or quiet it down in some other way?,"There is no way for you, the user, to control the fan. Disabling it could result in your drives running excessively hot and I would not advise it. The fan is quiet enough that you should not be bothered by it, if you are listening to music, watching tv or movies (even if you are listening to them at low volumes)."
"If using in RAID 1 and one HDD fails, do I just plug a new HDD and the enclosure will mirror the good HDD to it?","That really is about all there is to it. Of course, during the process your new drive will be appropriately partitioned, formatted, etc...but it is all handled by your RAID software. Just be aware that when you buy a replacement drive, if you buy one that is larger or has a faster rotational speed than your remaining drive, the performance of the replacement drive will be limited to matching the size and speed specifications of the remaining drive. (Don't buy a 4 TB drive if the remaining drive is 1 TB...it will work, but you will lose 3 TB of usable space.)"
I was given a pair of WD 600 GB Velociraptor drives. Would this enclosure accommodate their heat sinks/size and keep them cool enough?,"Heat output of HD's varies widely, but the design of the aluminum case and the fan in the rear give as good a cooling as you are going to get in a Mirrored external case."
"I am planning on buying this case. I am going to put 2, 4 Terabyte drives in here adding up to 8 Terabytes altogether. Will it work properly?",Check the Vantec website. I have used 2 - 3 T with no problems. They are always updating their product...
Has anyone used this product with a mac? If so what is your experience? I plan to find a USB enclosure to connect two 750GB drives in RAID 0.,"I used this on my Mac and it corrupted two of my drives. I sent it back for an exchange due to a problem with the power supply. Vantec was less than helpful with the corrupted drives. My hard drives worked when I pulled them out of the computer but after using their faulty enclosure it was corrupted, somehow they claim there's no way to tell their enclosure caused the damage. I would never put my hard drives into another Vantec enclosure."
Are you able to format the drives as you want like FAT 32 or NTFS?,"This is not a NAS it is hardware RAID it's just like a RAID controller in a server you can partition and format the RAID volume in any way supported by the OS. I've even used these with Mac OS X and Linux and had no problems with MBR or GPT partition tables, complicated partition schemes, HFS+, LVM, BTRFS, XFS etc. With Windows 7 or newer it registers as an internal disk instead of a removable drive so NTFS works but you will have to jump through some hoops to get FAT32 just like you would with a regular disk ExFAT may be easier. FAT32 has some applications but is insecure that's why MS made it difficult to access in newer OS."
"If using Raid 1, how should I do to switch a fail HDD? Do I have to switch it while power is on?",No. It should be powered off.
Does this come with any software to manage the RAID? What file system does the RAID use?,"No, it's a hardware RAID enclosure. The RAID mode is set via a pair of jumpers inside the unit and any file system is supported. The unit appears as a single disk to the OS once configured."
Will this work with solid state drive,I'm very sure it will work with SSDs but you probably won't get the performance you expect. It would be more economical to get much cheaper HDDs.
"could I use 2.5"" to 3.5"" adapter trays in this so I can use 2.5"" ssd's?",Yes
Is it possible for this unit to sit flat so that the surface where the laptop sits is level rather than angled?,Yes
"In order to connect to the computer, you need a double USB cable correct?",The cable you need comes with the fan. One end into the fan's USB and the other end into the PC's USB and you're good to go.
Is it comfortable to use on your lap sitting in a chair or is it just for flat surfaces?,"No, it's meant to be on a flat surface. It would also be hard for the fan to intake air if it is blocked by your lap. Regardless, it is uncomfortable."
I was wonder if you guys knew what turbo boost is? if so will this help me keep it on longer,Turbo boost makes the fans run faster. This cooler does not have that. But it cools very well.
how noisy is it,Load at first quiten down after it runs for a while.
"Theres two USB connectors... One of them is used for power, then what is the other one used for?","This is a good question. I just tried to connect my cellphone to USB, and it works. Laptop showed my cellphone disc. So it`s extra USB port for laptop."
My laptop measures 16.5 inches wide by 10.5 inches deep- will it fit? Is there room for a trackball? Thanks!,"The cooling pad is generous, but it is not designed for a mouse. If you look closely at the image, the mesh is for free air movement. You might want to go with one that has solid surface space on the sides. Remember, however, that you are then sacrificing cooling ability. My laptop's fan is on the far side, so I had to have this full mesh set-up. The mouse issue is not really that important to me since I usually work it farther off to the side to avoid repetitive motion injuries."
Does the air flow up or down?,Sorry to take so long; been gone. It flows up.
How do you open it up to get the cord out? No instructions included.,Cord in separate plastic bag.
Is it easy to clean? After a while dirt starts accumulating in the cooling pad and i am looking for something that can be cleaned easily.,"Yes, it is easy to clean. I haven't had any issues with dirt buildup yet, but a can of compressed air would easily clean out the fan areas. So far all I've needed to do is wipe down the outside for the little bit of dust that has gotten on it, and I've had it for several months and use it on a constant basis."
why does the fan have two usb ports?,one for power and the other one is for a usb to ac adapter. if you dont want to siphon off power from your laptop.
Do the fans blow air toward the laptop or pull air away from the laptop?,Blow air toward the laptop
what are the dimensions on this?,This is quite large as the dimensions are approximately 14 x 14.5.
does that comes with 1 year warranty if not i can cancel my order,"Atiq, I don't remember if it has/had a one year warranty. I will say that for the price this is an awesome cooling pad, well worth the risk mine has been through a lot of wear & tear not to mention a move with me from one side of the country to the other. It is a great value warranty or not."
Does this work well while using it on your lap?,Yes
does fully support a 17in laptop? so that it isn't hanging off the cooling pad at all?,"It would def, I have a 16"" laptop and it was still a bit larger and supported the laptop without it being at all close to the edge."
I just want to use this as a television hooked up to a dvd player. Is this a good choice for simple use and is it easy to set up just to watch dvds,My experience has been plug and play with this television. Jessie
Does it come with the HDMI cable?,mine did not but I did not expected it to. They cannot anticipate what lengths people will need.
Will the wi-fi interefere with the current wi-fi I use for my computer?,"No, The TV connects with the same wi-fi network that you use for your computer. We are very pleased with the TV, which we use in our bedroom and purchased primarily for it's color (white). It comes with Netflix and Amazon Instant video built in. We wish that it had Pandora, but that's no big deal. The picture and sound are excellent for our application. Enjoy!"
Does this TV have a sleep timer?,It most certainly does!
How many HDMI inputs?,4
Panaxonic TC32Lew56 White.....number of pixels??,"Hi Jean, The TV supports a max resolution of 1920x1080 which is about 2.073 Megapixels. I hope this helps."
Will a DVD player work with this TV?,"yes, of course!"
no picture,"Turn the unit up-side-down when inserting the power cord, then rotate it counter-clockwise. It took me a few tries before the first success."
"My sound keeps shutting off randomly, my cable company walked me thru it and concluded it's not them..what can it be?","When you say ""sound"", are you referring to the sound from the TV itself or sound from external speakers (e.g., soundbar)?"
"will I need another cord from the tv, this one is not long enough","yes, you'll need the hdmi cable, this is merely an interface / ""plug"" to the hdmi cable"
Le Pan ACHO 1 30-pin to HDMI cable adaptor: Can someone explain this cable to me and what it does?,"Your answer to the ACHO1 30 pin to HDMI. You are in luck. With this short cable and another one, a HDMI cable, with a male connector on both ends, the data from your tablet can be transfered to your TV. Provided your TV has an HDMI input. I suggest a ten foot (10) HDMI cable. GOOD VIEWING."
could I use this with a Samsung galaxy?,"i don't think so, there is a slight difference, just like Ipod stuff, it doesn't quite fit right, I tried a samsung plug on mine after asking if it would work and someone told me it would but they were wrong so. I am advising you not to get it, if you do you can try it but then you would have to return it if it doesn't work."
will this adapter allow me to watch netflix from my mitsunichi M97 on my hd television ?,This cable will allow HD video out on the Le Pan ll and Le Pan S. I don't see any mention of HDMI out capability for the m97. So my best guess is maybe. If the m97 has HDMI out then yes you will be able to plug it into your TV and watch anything the tablet can play including Netflix. Basically whatever is on the tablet screen is mirrored on the TV. Keep in mind the tablet is 4:3 ratio and your TV is 16:9 so the picture will have black bars n the side unless you zoom in a bit. http://www.forum.lepanlife.com/thread-1992.html
canThis be used as charging cable if used with AC adapter,No it can't . There is a 30 pin connector on one end and an HDMI female on the other. It works with the Le Pan ll and Le Pan S to connect to a TV for HDMI out only. You need a Le Pan AC101 USB cable to connect to a charger
Le Pan ACH01 30-Pin to HDMI Cable Adapter for Le Pan Tablet: Any idea if this would work with the MarquisPad - MP977?,"I have a Le Pan S and a MarquisPad MP977, ordered this for the Le Pan but will try it on the MP977 as well when I receive it and will post back if it works for that tablet as well or not."
will this work with windows surface pro?,For me it did not. I returned it after wasting about three days of knowledgeable investigations and tests.

Any tips on cleaning the keyboard? I've had it for over a year and am having major issues with sticking keys. I clean it once a week with canned air,"I use a compressor because of the extra pressure but if you don't have one the compressed air in a can that you are already using is the only option. Words of caution, just don't shake it first and make sure to keep it upright otherwise the liquid will come out into your keyboard. If you only spray the air while it is sitting flat you may not be getting everything out of the keyboard. I like to turn mine upside down and rotate on all sides to make sure everything has a chance to come out. If any liquids (soda, coffee, libations, etc) have been spilled into the keyboard then the compressed air or air compressor may not work for you, you may need to replace the keyboard. There are plenty of places online to purchase a replacement keyboard and instructions to get it done. They can usually be found for under 25 bucks. Takes about 45 minutes or less and just about anyone can do it with the online instructions. Hope this helps Dave"

Windows has functions like compatibility settings and other options to try to emulated the old environments, but perhaps the most suitable tool to certify you can run your legacy software is Windows XP Mode (http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/install-and-use-windows-xp-mode-in-windows-7), you don't need a valid license as its include within the solution and it comes from Microsoft, so you don't have to worry about spyware or other third party software affecting your computer.

Will it work with the garmin gps 2006?,"Sorry, I don't know the answer, you have to call Garmin 1-800-800-1020."
"Hi, is it the nmea 0183 version?","If you look at the manual for this device, you will see information about wiring this for NMEA 0183. I purchased this unit and managed to get this working in this mode. It took some work to determine the right connections. I did have to use the included diode (or whatever it is) that slows down the communication output rate for my devices to work. Once properly connected, it has been working very well."
Do you think this GPS receiver will work with an Interphase CS169 chartplotter (NMEA 0183 compatible)?,No idea.

Can I plug a microphone in here and maybe use it for my wedding speeches? Anyone knows?,"I don't think it would work because the only input is a small stereo input. Plus, it probably wouldn't be loud enough unless you were in a very small room."
This unit will not play from folders on a usb stick and my computor will only download into folders on the sticks. How are folders eliminated???,I was successful with playing music from the GOgroove. I had a folder called music on my USB and I put one song in the folder. Once you plug the USB into the GOgroove it will find and play the song. I then tried multiple songs and they played sequentially. All computers will download to the root folders of any drive and it may be easier to put the songs on the USB in the root folders. The GOgroove does play songs from the USB and will find them and play them sequentially from all folders on the USB. The con is that you cannot select the order of play.
Does it work with an 8GB or larger SDHC flash card?,"I have only tried my 16GB USB Drive, and it worked.."
"If I buy two (2) of these speakers, can I connect the two of them together so my music will play through both of them at the same time.","Only using a ""Y"" adapter out of your music sources headphone out port.

"Do you find the 20in space useful, or is it overkill? Not sure I want to may 20 dollars more for 10"" of cable..","I never use this keyboard at my desk; I'm trying to avoid sitting or working in a normal way. I always use this keyboard while I'm laying on my back; either with key-pads on either side of me or both keypads on my chest. In either case the 20-inch gap was critical. If I was merely using this at my desk, I suspect the 9"" cable would be sufficient. Either way I have been thrilled with the product. There is a clasp that allows both sides to be locked together. I broke that clasp and wrote an e-mail to the company. They simply dropped another clasp in the mail. Very responsive!"
How much space between keyboards?,"For the KB800PB-US-20, there is a 20 inch wire connecting the keyboard halves. I haven't measured it exactly, but you get about 19"" of separation based on where the wires attach. (If using the hinge clip, the top corners are attached and can pivot, but not separate. It's easy to remove the hinge clip, though.)"
"Does this keyboard have chiclet type keys or the big, regular keys?",Regular keys.
Does this keyboard use USB or bluetooth to connect to computer?,USB

"Will this case fit a Kindle 2, 3G w/keyboard? Size is 5 1/4"" x 8"".","The width is fine, and length is only 1/4 inch smaller; so if centered it would only stick out a little on the ends (which wouldn't affect the basic purpose. I say go for it."
Does it fit a Kindle Fire HD 7 inch tablet?,"I do not have access to a Kindle Fire to test, but going off the dimensions I don't think so. Length it will fit fine since the Kindle Fire isn't as long as my Nexus, but the Kindle is more than 20mm wider and I do not believe the case is wide enough to fit. Edit: in regards to the adhesive. It is double sided tape, but I removed my tablet from it after being stuck on for two days and no residue was left behind. But that may be due to the finish of the Nexus 7 (2013)."
I have a Samsung galaxy tab 3 8.0 will this fit?,It was perfect for my Samsung galaxy tab 2. I am not sure about 3

I did a factory reset and the default user and password does not work. Anyone else have this problem?,I googled and found the username and password pair as 'cusadmin/highspeed' for Comcast Business Gateway. I can't find wireless setup when I logged in the gateway. Comcast may have disabled the wireless feature. How can I enable WIFI with this modem?
Can this product handle 50 mbps or more?,"According to the specs page on this site, it does up to 400 Mb/s (megabits/sec). NOT 400 MB (bytes), which would be 3.2 Gigabits/sec, as someone else answered. But 400Mb/s is more than enough for any cable internet provider in the U.S., unless you have Google Fiber."
Was this in a 'made for retail' packaging?,My unit was not. it was from a 3rd party
comcast?,"I'm dealing with this now. I called Comcast, gave them the MAC and serial numbers, and they said this modem is not compatible. Their list of compatible cable modems at http://mydeviceinfo.comcast.net shows the NetGear CG3000DCR and CG3000Dv2. So now I am trying to upgrade this CG3000D to CG3000Dv2, but it does not look good. Waiting for NetGear tech support chat as I write... I might need to return this cable modem, and order one on the list. More later...

Is the router safe or can someone not in my network use my wi-fi?,"this router is like all others. if you set up the wifi with WPA2, you will not have issues with anyone using your wifi. remember to change the admin password of your router also."
will it support a internet phone ?,"Your question could be interpreted two different ways. 1) Will the service provided a through this modem allow for VOIP service - the modem doesn't restrict VOIP service, however your ISP might. and 2) does this modem have an RJ-11 modular phone jack on the back panel so you can hook your POTS phone into it... Mine does not, but there may be telephone-capable variants of the CG3000d that does have that feature."
time warner,This modem has worked perfectly with Time Warner since the day we have installed it.
How is it wired? It seems to have 8 pins. Keys are binary encoded over the wires? Short circuited when pressed? What if multiple keys are pressed?,"There are 8 pins. If this were binary encoded, we'd only need 5. Instead, this uses a matrix. There's a pin for each row, and a pin for each column. To read a key press, we check for current between a particular row, and a particular column. This works fine for one key press, but it's not good for more than one. EG: 1 and 5 being pressed looks the same to the computer as 1, 2, 4, and 5 being pressed simultaneously, because both scenarios result in current in the same pair of columns and rows. Also, google keypad wiring for some great examples of how to use this."
Is there an existing library for the hardware or some code examples?,There is a keypad library available at Arduino Playground. Also see Brad's *Duino Blog Using 4x4 keypad for more info. Hope that helps.
will it work with raspberry pi,Yes probably it should work with any device that can provide digital inputs and digital outputs. For more information check out this tutorial http://pcbheaven.com/wikipages/How_Key_Matrices_Works/
Is it compatible with Microsoft Surface?,"The quick answer is NO. The more complicated answer is, if you interface this with say something like an Arduino Uno, and plug that into Surface's USB port then you can readback the values being pressed. With that said, this is not a Laptop/Tablet accessory, this is an electronic device or component that you use for in conjunction with other electronics in your project or as a replacement for a broken keypad for example."
"I just bought one but I have to ask... does it seriously come with VGA and DVI cables, but no HDMI cable?!",True. Get HDMI cables from monoprice.com.

does this work with mac os x 10.5.8???,I have Mac OS X 10.7.5 and it worked with it.
What do i need to use this as a tv without a computer?,"I think you would need a TV tuner, cable box, or satellite TV box with an HDMI output. Connect that output to the HDMI input on the monitor and it should work. I haven't actually tried this, however, so I can't say for sure."
"I have an Inspiron laptop by Dell. Is this monitor is compatible with it? If so, anything additional I will need to buy besides the HDMI cable? Thanks.","Actually, you don't even need the HDMI. It will work fine with a VGA cable and speaker cable. My wife's Windows 7 Inspiron runs it with no problems."
I saw on specs that it does have a USB connection and one answer here says it does 3 that says no USB any clues as to what this is about.,No USB HDMI ONLY
Do the speakers work without the software install,Yes if you plan to use the regular speaker cable. Via hdmi would need drivers.

can't anyone just lift the table stand and take the whole thing? (laptop and lock),"It wouldn't do much good around just a table leg. If the leg has some kind of open bracket at the top, you feed it through that. Then, they would need to remove the table leg to take the laptop and lock."
"Is this compatible with the new dell inspiron 11 3000 series, the 2-in-1?","Yes, it should be. I have a new Dell Inspiron and it works for me. The lock spots are pretty much universal."
"Can it be used with a MacBook Pro, 2011?",Yes! I have a MacBook Pro from 2011 or 2012 and it works. There should be a small opening for a lock next to the CD drive.

"Does it work on PC computers (HP, Dell, etc.)?",It should. It works on my Mac and I think it's the same port
how does this item work ?,"Thread the lock around some heavy or immovable object, then insert the ""T-bar"" on the end of the combination cylinder and change the number. This locks the T-bar into the laptop until you turn the combination lock to the correct number. This is a different brand, but it's basically the same product with the same operating principle: http://youtu.be/5nZYhVHBmxs"
Does it work on Mac Pro computers?,Yes.
Can this be use on the Acer Apire E5-731?,It's so useful and good.
how do I install?,"The tip of the lock is T-shaped. This part goes into an ovoid shaped hole in your equipment. When you unlock the combination, you will be able to twist the T-shaped tip 90 degrees which secures it inside the hole. If you can't find the hole, find the documentation for your device and look for something called Kensington Lock in the diagram. Laptops, PCs and extrernal hard drives usually have a Kenington lock port somewhere on them."
"Does this fit a 13"" MacBook Pro?","Pretty much every electronic device has a Kensington slot. And yes, this will fit into the little ""slot"" next to the Superdrive of a 13"" MacBook Pro. All apple computers have a Kensington lock slot."
"For Macbook - Does this fit in the USB, Ethernet, Firewire, or Thunderbolt slots? Newest macbook does not have ethernet &amp; firewire.",It does not fit into any of these slots. It fits into the lock slot.

How does this attach to a Mac Air??,"I used this cable with Mac book pro, it worked fine but with frequent use it start to scratch the edges of the whole where it goes in the macbook. I have no Idea how it works with Mac book air."
Is this cable compatible with Macbook pro?,"Yes, I'm using it with a MacBook."
can you download the video to your pc without an internet connection? i have only dial-up,"The only way to see the motion detection video clips on your PC, whether or not you have an internet connection, is to pop out the SD card and put put it in an SD card reader (your PC must have one, or you can use a USB card reader device). The most annoying thing about this Uniden system is the fact that you cannot view any motion detection clips remotely. You must have physical access to the SD card. This was a deal killer for me. I returned the system."
"I've got this Uniden system to send email messages, how do I get it to send SMS or MMS message notifications?","wireless carriers have an email address that correlates to your phone numbers...i.e. for VZW, it's xxxYYYZZZZ@vtext.com, where the xxx is your area code and YYY and ZZZ are the rest of your phone number. So, the Uniden is really just sending an email to another email address that converts it to a SMS or MMS text that your phone can receive. This article can help explain it, although some of the email addresses are probably a bit dated (check with your carrier for the most current format): http://computer.howstuffworks.com/e-mail-messaging/how-to-send-text-messages-computer.htm"
motion detected,Yes motion works great
"I purchased this March 2013, It (the display) died Nov 2014",I had a similar issue with mine. I sent it back for service and it took 4 weeks for them to send it back. Bad service!

These units say they have a rechargeable lithium battery. Is it in the camera or the monitor? downloaded instructions do not show how to get to batte,Just in the monitor the cradle is the charger
"I can't get the apps to work; on my PCs, or Android phones. Anyone know of any fixes?","For the PC part you need to go www.unidenvideo.com, when there you need to create an account and register your item. some steps need to follow like chose a system name, download software update. at the end to install OCX plug-in to see the video, don't forget you must change the security code and enter that code everything you want to see the video in your PC.

Does this fit iPad Air?,I'm not sure. I have an iPad 2 and it fits perfectly! It's the best purchase yet!
Does the mount have a swivel? Can I turn the I-Pad without turning the tripod?,Yes. You can move the iPad from horizontal to vertical without moving the tripod.
Does this work with the new ipad air?,Not the model I bought. If you buy one make sure it's specific for the iPad Air. I love the one I have for my iPad 2. It works nicely for videoing kids sports. Just make sure no balls come flying by to knock it over!
Will this work with the iPad mini? Or just the iPad?,ipad mini will not work with this
does this have a swivel head?,Yes. And it works very well. Use the iPad vertically or horizontally.
Will this fit the ipad 1,I don't think so. The ipad 1 is bigger and thicker. I use this as a tripod while shooting.
can I use that with an Otterbox case?,No the iPad has to fit into the piece that attaches to the tripod. Your iPad has to be taken out of the Otterbox
Need something really sturdy to video in a volleyball gym. Is this easily tipped over,"If you open the legs wide enough so that the center support pole does not touch the floor, then its pretty sturdy. It was designed to hold an ipad and it works very well for that in my use of the tripod. This is a lightweight tripod, but pretty sturdy when using it as it was designed."
"my iPad is 9 1/2"" by 7 1/4"" (not sure if it's 2,3 or 4). Will it fit this mount?",yes
Will it fit on the Ipad mini?,"not sure, but you contact them"

Can you access Amazon prime with this player? thanks,Amazon Prime is not available on this player. I wish it would be.
need red/white connection into my receiver so I can use my external speakers. will the lg blu ray bp 620 do this?,"Thomas, this blu-ray player has the Red & White audio out connectors so you will be able to connect it to your external speakers. Joe"
this bluray can play MKV 3D SBS files from the USB port???,from the usb as if you can watch movies in 3D
Do all necessary cables come with the dvr,"it's wi fi capable but you may need sound or other connecting cables that will depend on your whole system (amplifier,t.v., other media players).their help number is 1-800-243-0000."
How can I stream movies from my cell phone to it,I do not think you can. I do not know any DVD player that gives you that option. You would need to purchase a Chrome cast.
"This player for USA? and is also to Venezuela, is 110v? equal region?","Yes for USA, not sure about Venezuela"
why does the picture black out,Turn the TV on
Is this unit fully region free?,"Unfortunately, my answer would be a guess and I suggest you contact LG at http://www.lg.com/us. My best guess is that it is not ""region free"" or has an international format!"
Does it also play dvd and cd audio?,Yes it does.
What are the dimensions of the bracket?,"The bracket is just over 6"" long, just under 1"" wide, and 1/4"" thick at the rubber mount and 1/8"" thick where there is no rubber. The knobs are 1"" wide and 1/4"" thick and the flash mount stands about 3/4"" high."
Looks like just what I am looking for BUT- HOW DOES THE EXTERNAL HOT SHOE CONNECT TO THE HOT SHOE ON THE DIGICAM??? (i USE THAT ONE FOR A VIEWFINDER).,You are going to need either a cord http://www.amazon.com/Canon-OC-E3-Camera-Shoe-Cord/dp/B000OEP3F4/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1370724162&sr=8-5&keywords=canon+external+flash+cord or a wireless solution. Something like this http://www.amazon.com/YONGNUO-RF-602-2-4GHz-Wireless-Trigger/dp/B003ARRAA8/ref=sr_1_4?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1370724230&sr=1-4&keywords=yongnuo+canon+trigger I got both. Both do the job. Cord is a bit more reliable because wireless might get interference once in a while.
So the shipping is more than the product?,yup
Does this come with a keyboard and mouse?,It does. The keyboard is somewhat cheap feeling though.
"While streaming HD, audio is often garbled. What does this mean?","I have XMBC (frodo build) installed on my EB1503 (as I use the box as a media server) it has no problems with any of the HD audio associated with video codecs (DTS & Dolby TrueHD). I've never tried streaming from an online source (as I only have DSL). My audio/video goes over HDMI to my Onkyo TX-NR608. My experience would say that it is your decoding software having problems, not the EB1503 hardware."
"I see charger/ power cords as recommended accessories, does this come with an A/C power cord?","Yes, it comes with AC power cord."
Can the base be removed from the unit and lie down flat?,"Yes, the base does not need to be installed and lay the unit flat. However, I am not sure about the heat ventilation if you lay it directly on the surface of a table. The good thing is the ventilation holes are the edge sides which are not covered!"
Will this unit pass the Windows Media Center Digital Cable Advisory to support HD stations?,Yes it does
Does this computer have a solid state drive or not?,No
What comes in the box? Do I get a wireless keyboard and mouse? What cables come with it?,The ASUS ET2411IUTI-B002C comes with an ASUS brand wireless keyboard and mouse. The only cable that comes with it is a power cord that contains a brick or power converter.
Does it have a DVD player?,DVD yes...blu ray no.
Is this a touch screen?,Yes but it's not as responsive as a tablet. All in all it's pretty good.
is there a hdmi port?,"There is a port on the back of the machine that looks like one, but when I inserted an HDMI cable it didn't seem snug at all. There is a small symbol next to that port that looks like an uppercase ""D"". I'm not familiar with that symbol. I don't think it is HDMI."
How long is the 2555531U Desktop warranty?,If its new it comes with a 1 year manufacture warranty
Will system support 8 GB of RAM?,Yes

"They are showing this plugged into the new Thinkpad 8 an 8"" Windows 8.1 tablet, My question is, will this dock POWER the computer through the USB port","Nope, it does not to provide power or charge the battery."
Does power connect to the docking station from the power adapter and from the docking station to the Yoga Ultrabook?,"No, they are both powered by independent adapters. The docking station does not power the laptop."
Is this compatible to use with the Lenovo Y50?,"Yes, it will work. The docking station uses a USB interface and comes with its own drivers. Since my lenovo laptop doesn't have a DVD drive, I downloaded the drivers from the lenovo support site. The USB port replicator is as tall as a coke can and has a small power button on the top of the case. It also supports dual monitors. You just plug in the USB cable attached to the port replicator and you get a wired network adapter, USB ports and dual hdvi. You still need to use your power adapter that comes with your laptop. The replicator does not provide power to charge your laptop."
the Carbon X1 can drive the 4k 28 display. with the docking station I could drive one or two additional displays?,"Hello Robert. The Thinkpad USB 3.0 Docking station has two DVI ports on the back. At this time I'm driving 2 additional displays. 1 24"" samsung and 1 20"" Viewsonic. Both are low end models. Actually since the Samsung is an HDMI/VGA, I'm using the micro HDMI Out on the Yoga 2 Pro to drive that one. So essentially you could probably drive 3 additional displays including the yoga makes 4 displays total with the dock. Hope that helps. :)"
will it work with rhe G50-80 Signature,"Sorry, I have no idea b/c I don't know what G50-80 Signature is."
"does this docking station power the laptop, meaning can you use it to turn the laptop on and off or do you still have to open laptop and turn it on?",I think the question here is whether the docking station can power on the laptop. The answer is no. The docking station is just a port extension for the laptop.
I have a thinkpad t530: can I close my laptop &amp; just use the dock-attached monitors (or will that make the laptop power down)?,"My experience is whenever the laptops cover is closed, regardless of plugged into the Dock Station, it puts the laptop into sleep mode, would be a great feature, however, don't think it functions that way..."
will it work on z580,It should as long as it has a USB 3.0 port!
Will this work with a Y70?,"Yes, this will work with a Y70. This really is more of a port replicator than a traditional docking station. All you need to use this is an open USB port (preferably a USB 3 Port)."
"Has anyone used this docking station to successfully connect an external monitor to the Yoga 2 Pro? And if so, what monitor are you using?","I have used it with a Thinkpad Helix and believe it will connect to almost any VGA or DVI monitor, even both simultaneously. That said, I've had a lot of trouble with the Helix and the peripherals connected through the dock, and multiple trips back to Lenovo have been unproductive. I believe the problem is in the drivers but multiple wipes of the Helix haven't resolved the issue. I'm not a big fan of Lenovo at this point."
What operating system?,There is no OS on this system. You will have to load one yourself.
"""320 GB 5400 rpm Hard Drive Solid State Drive"". Since SSDs don't spin - so is this a hybrid drive, or was the person who wrote the ad confused? Which model has which??","This person was confused. You're right... SSDs cannot have a mesaurement of RPM since they don't spin. Furthermore, the ASUS EB1007P-B0040 comes with a conventional HDD and not an SSD, so unless they upgraded the drive to be an SSD, it should be a conventional 320GB HDD."
Does it have internal WIFI?,Yes
"what type output ports does this have? I assume at least one usb, hoping it has hdmi.","No HDMI, just VGA. See the specs http://www.asus.com/us/EeeBox_PCs/EeeBox_PC_EB1007P/specifications/ Front I/O Ports 1 x 4 -in-1 Card Reader 1 x Headphone 1 x Microphone 3 x USB 2.0 Back I/O Ports 2 x USB 2.0 1 x VGA(D-Sub)-Out 1 x RJ45 LAN 1 x S/PDIF out(Audio jack) 1 x DC-in 1 x External Wi-Fi antenna Card Reader 4-in-1: SD/SDHC/SDXC/MMC"
Will this be able to play HD video? I know the CPU is very weak so is the graphic system. All I want is a small media box that can play HD videos. Tha,No
Does this have Bluetooth?,No
"The manufacturer's web site states this computer comes with Windows 7 Professional, 32 bit. Could someone please confirm?","It does NOT come with OS installed. You have to install your own OS, (Linux, Windows). I am not sure if they have a version that comes with pre-installed OS."
"Has anybody put XP on it and if so, how difficult was it?","I have Windows 7 on it and it works just fine... Although I don't know how it handles on a day to day basis, I use mine as a Torrent Downloader and nothing else... Install was a breeze via USB THUMB DRIVE"
Can this PC Run Windows Server 2014?,I would doubt MS Server 2012 would install as this PC would not meet minimum hardware specifications. The same reason it won't install to a laptop PC.
Can Steam OS be installed and if so how is the in home streaming quality?,"Only if it is the ""RICE"" build of Steam. Home streaming of ""RICE"" could cause a real mess with this ASUS Eeebox PC."
does this player have an optical audio out? (toslik),No. Don't have
can you check your emails on this hetgearnetotv steaming player?,"yes you can check email if you have a laptop with an intel processor and running windows 7. here is the link to check if your laptop is compatible http://www.intel.com/support/wireless/wtech/iwd/sb/CS-031059.htm If your laptop is compatible, you can download the free Intel WIDI Widget here http://downloadcenter.intel.com/Detail_Desc.aspx?agr=Y"

When will Amazon Prime and Crackle be added to this player?,As I understand it never
Can you connect to Amazon Prime Instant Videos with Netgear?,"Unless they added it in the last firmware update, no it can not. I gave mine to my mom last month, but as if the last update it could not talk to Amazon prime videos."
Can't get audio via WIDI - picture works fine. Everything works perfectly on my Netgear NTV200S - streaming video and audio from its many channels AND the video from my computer onto my HDTV via WIDI. But only about 1 tries out of 10 do I also get...,"not sure why it happens, but when the laptop connects to the NeoTV in the first successful connect.. audio is not there. If you do a disconnect of the WiDi connection from the WiDi control app on the laptop and then do a connect again through the WiDi control app audio gets transmitted to the TV"
can it work witha tablet,You can only control the players menu from a tablet using the app. But the latest model NTV300SL has capability to stream from a DLNA server. SO if your tablet has DLNA capability this could be worth a try.
"Hello, can I use netflix with this equipment in another country out of the USA? I live in Costa Rica, and I'm interested to use this product to see mo","I would assume if you have a netflix account and an internet connection you could watch netflix in any country on any device (laptop, NetGear NEO, blueray player, etc)"

can this be placed horizantal,"Yes, you can orient it in either direction."
does this come with keyboard and mouse,Yes. Very good computer. Hard drive upgraded to SSD and it became very fast.
What hard drives are compatible with this pc? Sata2 or 3? 3.5in or 2.5in? I can't find those kind of details.,"2.5 inch, no room for an 3.5 drive you should go with the SSD, its easier on the power supply. I am not sure the compatibility between sata 2 & sata 3, the box has USB 3, that is good. I was surprised to see the box run win server 2012 when we loaded it as a domain controller."
"Question: In my country (Chile), the electric power is 220 VOLT, it will work?","yes it does, I use it in Italy and it works perfectly, the adapter switches automatically..."
Does this come with a remote control?,No it does not. It is a bare bone PC with no operating system or CD rom.
Can you install iTunes on it?,"Yes, as long as you install an iTunes compatible OS."
Does this come with a keyboard and mouse?,"No, this comes as a blank box. You will need to add a hard-drive and all other supplemental IO devices. You will also need to install an OS. I made this into a Linux Box with Ubuntu. In my case, I repurposed an old LCD monitor by bolting this onto the back and attaching an old USB keyboard and mouse. I'd recomend a ""light"" OS, as even the Ubuntu full OS slows this machine down."
"Does this unit come with a power chord, or do I need to purchase on separately?",Power supply comes with it.

I have 2 of these on my home computer...one as analog and one digital. The analog exhibits diagonal rain-like streaks. Defective or EMI?,I'm thinking defective. I used both inputs switching between DVI & VGA and both worked fine. But if the problem exists on both monitors when used as analog then you may have another issue.
Can this monitor tilt (or otherwise be adjusted) on its base? And how bad is the wobbling? Would I need to buy a separate stand for daily use? Thanks.,"No, the stand is a rigid fixture. It cannot tilt or rotate. The flickering of the screen is noticeable only if you watch closely. Not always though. The monitor cannot tilt, buying a separate stand will not help."
can I mount an external speaker's to this unit,"Yes,it has one green colored plug in under the unit,for speakers or to plug from monitor to back of your computer tower."
Can I connect this monitor to my laptop using HDMI cable?,"Not specifically. You have to get a DVI-to-HDMI adapter, which is available on amazon for a few dollars. Once you have that, then you'll have a great value for your money all-in-all. Just search for DVI to HDMI. Good luck!"
How is the quality of the speakers?,"The built-in speakers are ""tinny"" . . . No bass . . . I like music, so I have Bose speakers, one on each side of the screen. Sorry!"

Don't understand. Says USB ports 2 and then a 1. Is there 3? Or 1 or 2?,"I can re verify when I get home & check, but there are 3 ~ one on the left (if facing the screen) and two on the right. I have my wireless mouse dongle on the left, which keeps the two on right open for other things."
"I'm not sure I understand the benefit / speed difference between an AC router (or even N) and a ""wired"" Ethernet connection??","Wired connections are rated in as a number. There's 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, and 1000 Mbps (also called Gigabit, as 1000 Mbps = 1 Gbps). Depending on your network hardware and how much you want to spend, you can go faster, but those are the typical residential wired network speeds available. Similarly, wireless connections are also rated as a number. Wireless B (802.11b, circa 1999) is rated for 11 Mbps, wireless G (802.11g, circa 2002) is 54 Mbps. Wireless N (802.11n, circa 2007) is really the first wireless that can truly simulate a wired connection in terms of speed. Wireless N routers are sold with ratings in increments of 150 Mbps. This is why you see Wireless N150, N300, N450, N600, etc devices when you shop for one. N150 is 150 Mbps, N300 is 300 Mbps, and so on. Devices achieve these rates with by using multiple antennas and other multiplexing structures. The Asus AC-66U, when running in wireless N mode, (if I remember correctly, I can't find the spec on their website) is an N450 device. Thus, it runs at 450 Mbps. If your wired link is only 100 Mbps, this would offer a significant speed increase for the link between the router and client device. Wireless AC is the next revision of the wireless protocol (802.11ac). As you can tell from the title (""AC1750""), when running in wireless AC mode, this runs at 1750 Mbps, or 1.75 Gbps, almost twice as fast as a wired gigabit link. Wireless AC is still relatively new, and as such only very new devices have it (the Samsung Galaxy S4 and HTC One, for example, support 802.11ac), but you can be assured that almost every device that comes on the market beginning in 3-6 months on will support it and it will become just as ubiquitous as 802.11g and 802.11n have been. The main benefits to wired connections are the lack of interference, simple network security protocols (i.e. you require physical access to the network to access it), and a consistent speed link and latency. Wireless speeds and signal can fluctuate depending on other electronics in your home, the makeup of your home's building materials, and your location within/around it. However, even given these caveats, generally speaking, wireless is more than good enough for most folks to ditch a home wired network, saving the cost of implementing one if it doesn't already exist, so long as they don't leave their network open and use WPA2 to secure it with an effective passphrase. Wireless networks offer the speeds of wired networks, but with the added ability of being a mobile user, and the huge convenience of a quick and easy setup for locations without a pre-existing wired network. That being said, unless you're a Google Fiber subscriber or somewhere else with a 1 Gbps connection, the largest -- by far -- traffic bottleneck is your internet connection (cable/DSL/FIOS). While the increase in speeds with a new router might speed up response times and transfers between devices on your local network, the jump between N and AC will largely go unnoticed if the majority of your traffic goes to the internet. Still, with the constant march forward of technology in all aspects, I think it a worthwhile investment to spend a little more to purchase a quality AC router, of which this device certainly qualifies, rather than a wireless N router. If you already have a wired network, and mobile device speeds are not a concern, then you could just use a less expensive wireless router with gigabit ports to connect your wired links to. This could even be a wireless N device, if wireless speed was of no concern to you, and won't be in the future. If you're in that boat, then it would probably be worthwhile to investigate a lower cost option that would meet your need instead, as this router tends to be at the top of the price range because of it's 802.11ac support and large feature set. If a simple wired network is all you need, then it could be seen by some as overkill. Hope that answers your question. EDIT: Added a bit more about if you have an existing wired network."
"When in Access Point mode, are the guest networks firewalled off from your private network?","No, they are not. This is a sore spot with me. I worked with tech support a long time and they finally told me it's NOT supported in AP mode, only router mode. I ended up hanging an old AP off the DMZ of my firewall port for guest access and use the AC66U as my main AP for the wireless devices in the home. Other than that, the device seems decent enough. I have a USB hard drive hanging off it to share DLNA stuff, but also do this via GoogleTV box too. Lots of options these days."
How does one set up the USB to network a drive? Are there instructions for this somewhere. The User Manual doesn't seem to help.,"Use the web page from the AC66U. On the left you will see USB. Click that. That will give you page where you can set the name of the server, type of server etc. I would suggest getting some media on a USB drive first and pluging that into the ASUS. I don't use this feature but that should get you going!"
does this support dd-wrt?,"Yes. This is supported by dd-wrt. You can type in ""asus"" here and see that this model is fully supported. http://www.dd-wrt.com/site/support/router-database Also, security is the best reason to use dd-wrt on any router you can. If you've listened to the tech news lately you know that home routers firmware tend to be full of bugs that aren't always fixed and home routers are becoming a major attack vector. It isn't worth it for most manufacturers to continue to update their older routers firmware b/c they want you to purchase new one. So yes, it is supported and, yes it is important. :)"
Does it have built in Parental controls?,"Yes, the router has built-in parental controls that allow you to restrict specific devices for specific times as well as block specific URLs. In addition, you can set time limits on each guest network (there are 6 total, 3 2.4ghz and 3 5ghz). The biggest problem with the parental controls is the URL filtering is ""dumb"" in that you have to enter each restricted URL and there is a limit of 128. You'll find that you can easily find more than 128 anonymous proxy servers on the internet and if you can find them, so can your teens. You cannot whitelist and while you can keyword filter, it's a chainsaw approach."
Does this router come with guest network?,"Yes, several"
"After reading horrible reviews from 1 star rating reviews, does it really works for few weeks or months only ? is it worth the more money/price ?","absolutely, best router ever had...."
"I noticed most of the vents are on the bottom, and it runs warm when lying on a flat surface. Will it be more reliable if I use the stand?","I normally use it with the stand on a flat surface. I never notice it running hot, nor has it had any service issues. I tried using flat for a few days, as in the picture,and it doesn't see any overheating issue or performance issues. I do not think it will hamper you if you use it that way. I hope this helps."
Does anybody else find issues getting Firmware updates on their RT-AC66U? Every time I try to get the update it says I am not connected to the web???,"Download the firmware update (3.0.0.4.376.3626) directly from ASUS here: http://www.asus.com/Networking/RTAC66U/HelpDesk_Download/ Unzip the file to your desktop. It should look this this: FW_RT_AC66U_30043763626.trx Go into your router's settings and click on -Administration, followed by -Firmware Upgrade Click on the browse button and look for the file on your desktop. Click the upload button. Wait until it's done and reset your router. This also fixes the 5GHz issue many people are leaving negative reviews about."
Anyone using this router for 6months+ comment on long term performance?,I've had mine since 7/28/13 and have not regretted buying it even once. No problems whatsoever in that time. Might be the first router that I can say that about over a year later.
Does this come with a stock cooler or is it just the chip?,The Intel Core i7-3770T only comes in tray so the cooling fan is not included.
"Is this a ""Costa Rica"" chip or ""Malaysia"" chip?",What i received was a Costa Rica chip. thanks.
Is this a 3770T version?,Yes - http://ark.intel.com/products/65525/Intel-Core-i7-3770T-Processor-8M-Cache-up-to-3_70-GHz?ui=BIG&wapkw=cm8063701212200
Is the wiring harness INCLUDED with the receiver?,"There is a wiring harness for the radio, however in order to ease installation, buy a aftermarket adapter wiring harness kit. The $8 to 12 dollars are money well worth spent! In my case, I ordered the after market kit and soldered it to the radio harness, prior to the install. Everything, including the Double DIN adapter for my Toyota RAV4, took about 20 minutes to install. Get the right equipment and it's as easy as pie!"
Will the USB connection on this radio work with the iPhone 6? Can I control Pandora via BlueTooth on iPhone 6 with this radio?,my daughter had the iphone 5s and could control pandora via bluetooth but not sure about the iphone 6. This radio has a usb connection on the rear of the radio that you plug a bluetooth (flash drive type) that is supplied with the radio in and then select bluetooth connection on the radio to connect to the phone. That frees up the front usb for other uses. Hope this helps.
Can this work in a 2006 Kia Sorrento?,Yes it will. Also get the double din installation kit : http://www.amazon.com/Metra-95-1005-Installation-2001-2006-Vehicles/dp/B000K4V4WO/ref=sr_sp-atf_title_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1401492792&sr=1-1&keywords=double+din+installation+kit+for+2006+kia+sorento and also the wiring harness : http://www.amazon.com/Stereo-Harness-Sorento-wiring-installation/dp/B000KL31NM/ref=sr_sp-atf_title_1_3?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1401492973&sr=1-3&keywords=wiring+harness+2006+kia+sorento That should take the pain out of the install. Solder all connections and use heat-shrink tubing for a neat and safe look!
Do I need to install an external microphone or does it have a built in?,It comes with a mike that you can stick on the steering column with included adhesive pad.
Will it work in 08' Honda Pilot &amp; can it be hooked up to the steering wheel volume controls? Thanks,I had to purchase a metra axxess aswc interface sold on amazon to keep the controls working. Just had to follow the instructions and sign on to their web sight to find correct wires to splice into. Had to also order a metra kit to mount the receiver in the dash also off of amazon. Hope this helps. Good luck
how to install in a 2004 Chevrolet trailblazer,you'll need a double din installation kit from Metra and a harness adapter.
will this product work for my 2009 pontiac vibe,"look by pic on your car, radio built in special shape/integrated in dash. dont know until removal radio and see what inside, and what need to modify"
will it fit a 2002 blazer,"It fits in my 2002 Ford Explorer....goto YouTube and type in the name of this JVC RADIO ON HOW TO INSTALL....Guys and Company's are all the time putting ""How To"" videos on YouTube. Or! Goto JVC.com. They should be able to tell you what it fits. GOOD LUCK!!! It's an awesome radio for the price!!!!"
Can you use a 2 port hub on the rear USB connection. Allowing for BT and a rear USB input?,"I personally have not tried to do that, however the way i set my radio up you cannot access the rear port after everything is closed back up. But you still have the USB port on the front as well, hope this helps"
what car stereos will fit my 1999 oldsmobile intrigue gl,my f650
What is the speed like using on a USB 2.0 port?,32 MB per second
"Does anybody have experience on how it stands up to rain or humid environments? I live in the NW where it rains often, but would like to use it on a keychain that hangs from my pants loop. Thanks!","It will handle high humidity fine. Rain will not damage it, unless it is very high acid rain. With normal non-high-acid rain the only important thing is to never plug it in until it is completely dry inside. Since it is fairly difficult to be sure a semi-sealed case USB drive is completely dry inside the easy answer is don't get it wet. There's really no reason to have it hanging from a heychain on a pants loop outside. The extra bulk will just cause it to bang against things a lot while there are other drives with no possible way for water to get in."
"Is there a similarly fast (but doesn't need to be *identically* so) 64GB USB 3.0 drive, but much smaller? Broke my Sandisk because stuck out too much.","No. It has to be fairly large so it can have multiple lane, concurrent access to the flash dies and use an SSD controller. With today's existing tech in the marketplace, nothing small is even half as fast although some products out there only mention misleading best case scenario read speeds while this Sandisk Extreme has the distinction of having the highest performance across several other parameters more relevant to real world use. A safer way to use it would be to put it on a short USB3 extension cord."
Are these drives fast enough that I can store a movie on it and watch the movie directly. I've just ordered a new Macbook Pro and it has USB 3.0. Thx,"Yes, it should be more than adequate. I can do so on my PC running windows 7, so I assume the Mac experience should be at least as good."
Will this flash drive restore an image faster than an external USB drive? I have an ADATA that just arrived that is much slower than my passport drive,"I haven't seen any flash drive faster than this. I tested this and R/W 194/170. so, you won't regret."
How can a buyer be sure to receive the newer removable drive version of this pen drive? The fixed drive vesion would not be usable for our purposes.,"Unfortunately I don't have a solid answer for you, but I bought mine used and I believe it is NOT a static (fixed) drive. Here is a little more information about fixing static drives: http://superuser(dot)com/questions/699417/usb-making-tool-for-windows-detects-flash-drive-as-fixed-need-to-be-seen-as-rem"
Anyone else having trouble booting from this? I can boot from a full Fedora/Ubuntu install on 2/3 systems. BIOs problem with the third? - CS Grad Stud,"I had issues with at least two major PC brands whereas depending on the USB port I use USB flash drives, the unit is not recognized by the BIOS/UEFI, or it detects but later can't be open by the install application/boot loader. Sounds silly, but try to use a different USB port and see if that works for you."
will this work on Mac computers? will you have to reformat it?,"Yes you have to reformat, it comes formatted for Windows, but it works on the Mac fine."
Is this compatible with an Android Tablet using the USB port on an ASUS Transformer Keyboard?,I personally use it with my galaxy s3 and a cable OTG.
"How long is this? Specs say 2.8 inches, but is that with the USB extended or retracted? Considering putting on the motherboard in low profile case.",Retracted: 2 6/8ths of an inch; Extended: 3 2/8ths of an inch
Would this system be able to handle a SSD easily ?,"Yes, ours has a Hybrid SSD/HD (Seagate, 2.5"")."
Does it use a standard form factor for the motherboard?,No this only used Mini Thin ITX motherboards only.
Does it come with a SD Card Reader?,Yes it does.
"Is this compatible with 4th gen H81 chipset boards? If yes, is it compatible with the Asus H81T? If no, what 4th gen boards are compatible?","It should. Specifically, you want to look for ""Thin-Mini ITX"" which is what the H81T is billed as. It requires an LVDS connector and backlight power/controll connectors. Just keep the TDP of the processor below 60 watts."
What does this product include specifically? Does it include a motherboard? Wifi Card? or any other small devices? (I know a card reader is included),Its just the case (monitor) and the power supply. You have to supply everything else.
is this model touch screen if not do you have one for sell that is,This model is not touch screen
"Is there a detailed manual for this model? If my motherboard has built in WiFi-, do I need to do any other configuration?","hi Sercan, Wifi antenna is built in but module is not. you need to buy intel wifi module. In my case, i bought intel AC7260."
Does anyone know the maker (or make and model) of the display?,"Dear J Grand, The maker of this product is Barebone and it is new. I hope this helps and have a good afternoon! Sincerely, Andy King"
what size ram does it take regular/ laptop/or notebook,It depends on the motherboard. AFAIK all thin-mini ITX boards use 204-pin (laptop RAM).
"Can you please elaborate on the amount of Memory, HHD, Network card this model may or may not come with?","It doesn't come with anything. It is a barebones system. It is however, prewired for your display, side panel ports and webcam."
The part number isn't on SanDisk's website. What does AFFP mean?,"I may be wrong, but I think the ""FFP"" stands for Frustration Free Packaging, which is part of the Amazon Advertisement/Description."
"Can someone that bought the Frustration-Free Packaging version of 32GB or 64GB confirm that it also comes with a Lifetime Warranty? The Standard Packaging description shows the Lifetime Warranty, but it is conspicuously absent on the FFP product...","The frustration-free packaging comes with an insert information card. It has a lifetime limited warranty in the US and a 30 year warranty in Germany and regions not recognizing lifetime limited. Also, I think the frustration-free packaging needs a bit more padding. My experience with SanDisk USB sticks has been great. Very reliable and I can't recall a read or write error. My sticks are used mainly on Windows XP and Windows 7 machines and a Samsung blu-ray player."
Will it fit on a keyring comfortably?,"That's where mine is. At 70mm (2.75"") it's not a short stick but on the upside: 1) the case itself is solid and seems like it will hold up to the rough-and-tumble environment of a keyring 2) the usb connector withdraws into the case rather than simply having a cap which can work itself loose 3) there's a mount for a split ring etc. built into the case"
"If I uninstall any software SanDisk installs on my PC, and reformat the flash drive, does that permanently remove SanDisk software from the drive?","No, but it will keep the software from working or taking up space. Simple deletion will remove data/files for your use, but not prevent someone from reading it if they get access to the drive. Based on your question I assume you are using are using a PC, not a MAC. As someone who has worked in computer security, I can tell you that reformatting a drive does not remove the information. It simply removes the map of where the information can be found. The information is still on the drive and could be found and accessed by someone with the requisite equipment. That is because when you ""delete"" information from a drive or reformat it, it only removes the map of where the information is located. You would need to overwrite the files with other data to assure it is not accessed by someone. Experts recommend random overwriting it at least 7 times. There are a number of programs that will do this. If you need a free data eraser, I suggest you consider using Eraser Software. See: http://oithelp.nd.edu/information-security/faq/securely-erasing-usb-devices/ You should be able to download this software at: http://sourceforge.net/projects/eraser/files The above applies to both hard drives and USB Thumb Drives/Flash Drives. If you are not worried about someone accessing the information on your drive, just delete it and you are good to go. I hope this helps."
Do it have an activity light?,Yes - there is one - but you can hardly see it.
Is the password function compatible with newer android platforms where MS documents are functionable?,"Good question, sorry I have no experience using the password feature."
Why is standard packaging version 5$ more expensive than frustration-free packaging? Any difference in quality?,"Standard packaging is the thick, secured plastic packaging you may find at a local store. It's the packaging you have to use some super scissors or a razor blade to cut through...and hopefully not slicing your finger. Hence, the frustration-free packaging which is a cheaper packaging. If you owned a store front, you may want to get the standard packaging to minimize people stealing your product...however, if you are like me who is just buying the product...it's a nice alternative that reduces your cost of the exact same product."
Will this survive a trip through a washing machine?,"I don`t know yet Chris but I`ll ask my wife to make a try while washing my chlotes... I am that kind of person forgetting electronic devices into my pockets... Don`t worry, I`ll let you know ASAP it will happen to me."
"What is the difference between ""Frustration-Free Packaging"" and ""Standard Packaging""? The SanDisk Extreme USB Flash Drive is backed by a lifetime limited warranty.","It comes in a simple package that doesn't require power tools to open. I'm sure you know that many things come in plastic that requires, at least, a sharp pair of scissors. Frustration free just means that it doesn't come in that type of packaging and you will be able to remove it from the box/envelope and use it immediately."
my pc indicates only 29gb total storage on the 32gb flashdrive??,"Manufactures report the number of bits usable by their drives assuming that a kilobyte is 1000 bits (decimal thinking), while Windows reports the number of bits assuming a kilobyte is 1024 bits (binary thinking). Google ""(1000^3 * 32 * 8) / (1024^3 * 8)"" to get the amount of space in GiB, which is how much usable space you have as reported in the Windows operating system. Windows should report 29.8 GB usable on a freshly formatted drive. This has *nothing* to do with Windows 8 certification."
is compartible outrlander2006,"This it's just the shell. If the remote insides line up with the shell, it will work. This is not the remote itself."
Im looking for a Keyless Entry Remote Fob Clicker for my mitsubishi pajero 2003 do you have this?? thanks you,"I bought this for my 2003 Lancer and it was great. I opened up the broken one and the ""guts"" fit right in and I screwed it shut. It worked perfectly. Just make sure it looks just like the one you have now some have more buttons."
does anyone know how to replace the case without any problems?,"Just open the old one where the key ring is, and remove the chip and it in the new one."
Does it come with the screw to attach the two sides... I'm assuming it does but I just want to make sure,Never assume. It does not. You have to use the screw you have.
Will this work with Ipad air 2 (2014 release)?,"This case was purchased for the iPad Air not the iPad Air2. My understanding is the iPad Air2 is about 18% thinner than the first iPad Air. Since the case has a plastic mold that snaps onto the edge of the iPad, I would think that it may not hold on to your device properly. Additionally, I dont recommend this cover because it never really worked in the angled standing position. The slighlest nudge and it flops down flat and doesnt work as a stand. The ridge it sits in is not deep enough to hold it in place in my opinion. Hope this helps."
Does this close with a magnet or a elastic strap? in the stock photos it appears to me a magnet but in the user video below it appears different,It close with a magnet . The elastic strap is also close with extra security. It works both ways. I like to place the heavy side on top just to have a better closure. Either way will work just fine. Thats just me. Ihope this willhelp.
The description suggests that this item comes with the keyboard. is this correct,that is incorrect. It does not come with a keyboard.
Can you switch off the Auto Sleep/Wake feature?,Not as far as I can tell. Doesn't come with any indication that it's possible to toggle the auto sleep features.
It says iPad 5..I have iPad Air. So does this work,Yes. it fits well. The iPad 5 is the iPad air model.
will this product open to use the ipad in a flat position with the front cover behind the iPad or will it only open like a book.,open like a book
I want to connect my laptop to my tv my laptop has bluetooth but tv doesn't can i plug this into my tv and connect them,In order to use a Bluetooth adapter your television would have to have Bluetooth software pre-installed which isn't likely if your TV isn't already Bluetooth capable.
Does this adapter work with a bluetooth headset/earpiece like for a cellphone? I want to use my earpiece for skype cals,Hi. The headset I use with this Bluetooth dongle has a mic as well and can connect to my cellphone so I don't see that it would be an issue. Just make sure you un-install the old Bluetooth drivers and then install the new drivers off the DVD before plugging in your new dongle and it should set up just fine.
does this work wit plantronics backbeat go2,"Hello, FYI, I returned this same item for a refund. It didn't work the way I was expecting it to. It may work better for you though."
Can someone please tell me the hardware ID of this dongle? (USB\VID_xxxx&amp;PID_xxxx),"Sorry, I can not provide that information you're looking for Sir. I purchased that item, But I returned it. It did not work as I expected."
does anyone know if this works with motorla H550 Bluetooth Headset and how to make it work.,"To be honest with you Shawn, I actually ended up returning my purchase of the same item, and purchased a different item. The sound quality for this item was not very good. It worked just fine though. Sound quality was poor. Just being honest."
I noticed that no where on the head does it say the name of the unit??,"Like many Chinese photo products, this head is sold by several different distributors under different names. I've had two of these for about year, and they are excellent value for the money, but they aren't perfect. Perfection costs about 4X as much."
Can i mount this on a MONOPOD?,"Perhaps with some adapter screws, but it would not be a good choice for a monopod. Taking advantage of the smooth panning abilities of this head require a resistance to turning that a monopod does not offer, and it is rather heavy."
may be a dumb question but when I try and turn it - ie rotate - it tries to unscrew from the tripod I mounted it on - and yes Ioosened,"In my experience, that sounds defective. It should turn if the knob is loosened. It should only unscrew if the knob is tight."
Does this unit have a flat base or a bowl?,It has a flat base. I have also have the same head with a ball if you are looking for one.
"There isn't a pic showing the bottom of this, but I assume you can mount this on a slider?","Yes sir, that's exactly what this is for. You won't regret the purchase, it's a great buy."
Is it fluid in every directions?,Yes
can this be used with a slider?,Yes
Do this head works with a manfrotto tripod? my model is Manfrotto MK294C3-A0RC2,"Yes its work , I don't know about ur model but I use it with three different models of manfrotto one of them is 055"
"what material is the head, handle, and baseplate made out of?",Both made of metal and solid plastic good quality though.. I bought two of this but one seems not to be as fluid as the other.. For the price is a good choice
Can You Get Parts For This Fluid Head?,"mine was as stiff as a rock and I still haven't been able to loosen it up. You can replace the handle/base/knobs as I used parts from another tripod for preference, but idk if the manufac. offers them."
Does this device work with Windows 8.1?,"Yes, you can make it work. But you should note that according to Prolific's website the chip in this device is counterfeit. I recommend sending it back for a refund, but if you're like me - it's way too late for that. To get it working on Windows 8 (or any other version of windows for that matter), follow the instructions on: leftbraintinkering.blogspot.com/2013/05/usb-to-serial-prolific-2303-device.html I tried a lot of different drivers, these are the only ones that worked for me."
"Does this cable require that I provide a TTL reference voltage? I have a 3.3V TTL UART but can only connect to Tx, Rx, and GND.","Connecting only Tx, Rx and Gnd works for all of my designs I have a few 5volt ones and a few 3.3volt. None of them seem to have any issues."
"I see four pins that are likely: 3.3v, txd, rxd and gnd. Which wire color goes to which pin?","if you open the back shell you will see: red = 5v black = gnd white = RXD green = TXD. 3v3, RTS, CTS, DSR and DTR are also available if you add wires"
How long is the cord? Thanks! KP Jandt,The cable is 1 meter in length (about 40 inches).
Will this work with linux? Will I need external drivers or does it work OOTB on the most recent version of Ubuntu?,I am using it with Ubuntu. It works fine. Just remember that it is a TTL logic USB to serial converter. Check that is what you are looking for before buying this.
"I just need USB to both 5VDC and 3.3VDC to power an airport express. Im confused by terms TTL, TX, RX will this cable work just as a power supply?","Hi Zachary ... Appears this is not what you want. [I am unclear if an Airport Express can be powered via USB and not its own power adapter.] This specifically is a USB-to-serial data cable with a built in UART chip. There can be very low levels of 3.3v or 5v generated (varies with various models) but that's not gonna drive a whole big device like Airport - more to drive one or two chips on a small board. This is designed for making your USB-equipped PC - desktop or laptop - look like it has a built-in COMn: serial port. FYI, ""TTL"" means transitor-to-transistor logic levels (meaning 5VDC), and Tx & Rx are the UART lines for transmitted & received serial data at logic level (not +/- 10+ VDC swing used by actual RS232 line levels)."
"Why does the description say ""RS232""? This seems to be for TTL, which is 3.3v and not compatible with RS232.","This is correct - RS232C does not use TTL levels and so strictly speaking this adapter isn't ""RS232"". However it does provide the same set of signaling wires and the same logical protocol as RS232C."
I would be using this on XP (32bit). Is there a link to the driver needed somewhere? Thanks,"Yes. Go to the Prolific web site or type ""PL2303HX driver"" in Google."
Wanting to use this to power a 5v fan from my usb on cable box. Will it work like this by using just the red and black wires?,I am not sure whether your PC have enough power to run a fan. I use it for data transfer and it works just fine.
Does this device work with 5V mcu's?,Its made to work with 3.3V TTL even though the power connector has 5 Volts
"Hi, I have a Sony NEX 5R with 16-50 mm lense. Can I use this housing? Also, Which model should I use? The 16mm lense or the 18-55 lense housing?","Since this 16 is no really a wide angle lens you can go with the 18-55 but you will not be able to zoom with this lens. It is mostly a 16-18 in the housing, you can't go out to 50. Works great and you can even get good close ups."
Will this housings fit the Sony Alpha a5000 with a 16-50mm lens?,"No, only the Sony Nex 5"
Can the zoom be used with the housing on?,"I could not find a way to use it. It did work very well with the non-zoom lens setting. I did have to remove the camera strap when I used this & use a strap on the housing. I hope that this answers your questions, I'm glad that I bought it."
Will this work for video?,"If your camera is the correct model for this housing, yes, the video function works. But be aware of the model listed, I have a Sony NEX 5, it does not fit into this case"
Will you be making a case for the NEX-7?,my son tested it and he said it works great.
Can you use the flash.,"Yes the flash can be used, and probably should. The photos are absolutely great. We just came back from schlitterbahn new braunfels. The only problem we had was moisture build up on the inside due to temperature difference from the ice cold water to the hot air, but that only happened once."
will it fit my nex 5n,"Yes, but some of the buttons don't work"
i have a sony nex 5...would like to get a underwater casing for 16mm lense..is it safe to use at beach around 5 -10 feet?how long it take for deliver?,"The model that I have is for 18-55 mm, but there is another identical for 16 mm. It's good until 100 feet."
does it have the whole thing including the lens that is 18-55 housing?,"Yes - I has the lens also, for the 18-55 housing. It comes with 2 o-rings."
do you ship to Germany?,"hello friend thank you for your inquiry yes,the item is ship to Germany have a nice day Emily"
do you ship to Norway ?,"Hi , yes, we can sent it to Norway"
How much is the shipment to germany? or is it for free?,"Hi ,yes ,it is free shipping ."
Is this an easy repair? My husband has a Zumo 550 and the screen does not come on.,Yes it's an easy repair. You'll need a T6 torx and a small phillips screw driver.
is there a warranty with this unit,No
is this for an 8 inch tablet,"I have an 8"" Nextbook and it fits just fine."
What are the actual dimensions? measurements please,"It is 8"" long & 6 1/2 wide. My Nextbook 8 fits perfectly in it."
Does this fit Lenovo idea miix 8 inch tablet ?,This product is trash.
Will Pipo Smart 2 work with this?,"I don't know what that is, but if it's the same size as the NextBook (eFun 9 inch) it should work. Check eFun measurements. It's a snug fit for length, but still a bit of room for length (long side). Good luck; hope this helps. Ginny"
Is this compatible with an HP Pavillion 300 watt power pc?,Shouldn't be a problem
"Anyone know much about quality of this unit-had one for any length of time to rate it? My Nvida Ge-Force 8400 by EVGA was junk, long story.","I bought this for a buddy about a year ago or so. It still works great he says. It's obviously not a high end gaming graphics card by any means, so if your planning on doing anything more than watching HD videos or playing some pretty weak games on it I'd recommend you get a better card. The thing about anything in a PC is you have to treat it right. You have to keep it cool & dust free if you want anything to last. Point of the story: Buy the card that fits your needs and treat it properly and it'll last. If you overburden it and let it overheat like crazy, it'll be dead within a couple years(or less)."
Would I be able to use this card on a 275 watt machine?,Yes
does it have an aluminum fan?,No
Will this card play Halo Combat Evolved i know its 13 year old game but there is a Halo Custom edition?,"Most likely it will work fine, but it is not a very high end video card, so there are no guarantees."
is it a plug abd play card,Yes. It comes with a software CD but should be recognized by your OS without the utilities. I'm using mine in a Dell OptiPlex 740 running Windows 7 32-bit with no issues.
can this card support 3 monitors?,no
"This card says ""Low Profile"", will this card work for desktop or is it cut down short for the compact machines. or both brackets supplied ? Thanks, V",I've got mine in a full size Dell Tower. No problems.
"i have hp pavillion elite 337, will it fit",Try reading this link www.likely-answer.com/.../Re--Getting-Gaming-Video-Card-For-Hpe-33 Also search on Google or Bing
I havea n all original CompaqSR5320LA. I am trying to find a graphics card for this machine that is good for Flight Simulator X. IS this the one???,"This lasted 5 minutes in my machine, and I could not wait to remove it. Horrible card. Piece of garbage. I went with the 640 version and it was (barely) enough."
Will it work with my Samsung Chromebook? (2013),Chrome does not currently support external optical drives like this DVD drive.
"does it burn dvds, two sided dvds","Don't know. It would not work with my notebook that had the Windows 7 operating system. Samsung ""support"" was no help."
Will it work with surface Pro-2?,"Although I can't say for sure, given that I don't own a surface pro, I can't imagine that it wouldn't. This is a fairly generic player and samsung seems to have a driver for it in the ""tablet PC"" category (http://www.official-drivers.com/installer/?seed=samsung&act=download&gclid=CKPY2_f-x8ACFShp7AodhH4Aig). Nevertheless, safest bet is someone who's already paired it posting an answer. I hope you get lucky!"
"How does this model, SE-218, differ from the similar Samsung model SE-208?","You can google Samsung SE-208 and SE218 to get comparative information. Because I was curious, I looked into it for you and called Samsung directly to ask what is the difference between the SE-208AB, -208DB and -218BB in a nutshell because all the specifications and prices I found were so similar, and there were contradictions between the Amazon and the Samsung specs. Having the actual SE-218BB item on hand, I can say that the dimensions, weight and USB port given in the Amazon description are wrong and the actual specs are more in line with those given on the ""official"" specs from the Toshiba/Samsung website, so the other specs on that website may also be more reliable: http://www.tsstodd.com/WebManual/External/SE-208AB/en/Specifications.html http://www.tsstodd.com/WebManual/External/SE-208DB/en/Specifications.html http://www.tsstodd.com/WebManual/External/SE-218BB/en/Specifications.html Comparisons indicate that all 3 are virtually identical in performance description and design, with minor differences in weight and slimness. The 208DB and 218BB appear to be the later versions in that they can accommodate USB 3.0 as well as 2.0 (also judging by the prices and ""first available"" date on Amazon). The Samsung tech, who said you can't judge by the sequence of model numbers, was of little help here as he said the only way to tell when a model was released was by the firmware number (which refers to hardware as well as software) on each item....but you have to buy the item first before you can see it, so what good is that in decision making?? At any rate, the Samsung tech agrees that you'd probably get the same performance and functionality from any of them, but the SE-208AB (0.81"" tall, 10.6 oz, USB2.0, Amazon $29.99, rank #7) is likely the oldest model, and with only a $5 differential in price between the three, and the SE-218BB being only a tad slimmer and lighter (0.55"" tall, 9.0 oz, USB 3.0/2.0, Amazon $35.12, rank #1) than the SE-208DB (0.81"" tall, 10.6 oz, USB3.0/2.0, Amazon $30.69, rank #2) it seems just a toss-up and personal preference between the latter 2, in my opinion."
Can it be use tocopy videos and pictures from a camcorderr ???,You would have to down load the files from the camcorder to your computer and then make certain that the Nexus can play that file type. Camcorders files vary according to the manufacturer. The Nexus can play the more standard types.
Can it work on Macbook Pro Retina Display?,Yes. It works perfect on my Mac w/Mountain Lion. Just plug it in and your set.
can this drive be used in the vertical position or does it need to be flat when playing a DVD?,According to the user manual it should not be used vertically
does this play CDs,Yes-I play CDs on it and it does a great job.
Will this work on a 2009 iMac?,"The drive works well on my system, an iMac running OS 10.9 (Mountain Lion). I did a quick online search and found users reporting no problems using OS 10.5 (Leopard) and several versions in between. Check your OS and search for the drive and your specific OS"
Does it come with usb cables?,Yes it did...however the player will not work and is too hard to set up with standard computers. It requires additional drivers not fond online and the disk provided does not install all properly.
will this work with the galaxy 2?,I am not sure but I wouldn't recommend buying this product. mine broke almost immediately.
"Does the USB charge and sync data cable fit samsung galaxy tab 2 7"" or just samsung galaxy tab?",Yes it should i have the Galaxy Note 10.1 it works great--as long as you have the 30 pin connector at the bottom like your charger it should be fine-it's just like the charger cable but longer
Does this work with 8013 10.1 note?,"Yes and no, it works only for small window time, then it conks out you. I tried ordering it twice and no success. The reason I wanted it so badly is due to the length. Nevertheless, I would suggest going through Samsung for the product..."
"I have the Samsung Galaxy Notepad 10.1, model # GT-N8000. will it work with my notepad","It will work. I wouldn't advise it. I have one too. This product is cheaply made and will break on you. I could never get it to quick charge and would have the battery die while it was on this charger. The plug part fit so tightly you had to be careful unplugging it, or it would rip the plug casing off. I thought about gluing it all in, and it broke the very next day, ripping all the wires off the solder. Theres another brand that has a 6ft. Cable that isnt usb. I bought that one recently and it actually charged my tablet to full while watching nexflix on maximum screen brightness. Go with that cable instead. Would not advise this purchase. Spend an extra couple bucks and get the other one."
"The input Voltage usually is 100-240v, thats true. My mistake. I need a cable with 19v output,","isn't the voltage determined by the brick you hook it up to? It does not ship with a brick, and I used the one I got from Samsung. That said, it says DC 101210(a) on it. So there you go."
Is it supposed to take 10-12 hours to charge my galaxy tab 2 or is my cable defective?,"In my experience, which is limited to one tablet and 1 example of the cord in question, it takes less than 4 hrs to charge from a fully discharged condition. This is true only when the usb cord end is attached to a propperly sized travel charger which in kind is connected to mains power. Unfortunately, the tablet does not charge efficently when the charger is enegised via a portable or temporary power generation system. When plugged into a car cigerette lighter adapter the tablet battery seems to have its charge extended, that is, the battery continues to discharge but at a slower rate. This charging ideocyncracy seems to lie in the tablets on board charging system."
Can I use this cable to download pictures from my galaxy tablet to my home computer?,Yes
Can I use this for a Galaxy Note as well?,Yes you can.
Does this cable work on the Galaxy Tab 2 (P5110) 10.1??,Yes. But it's not Extra Long. It's only 3ft. Not 6.
Can this cable be used for a Galaxy note 10.1?,Yes it can it is what thats what I got mine for. !! I love it 6.5 ft. Thst 2 or 3ft thing they give at the prices we pay.
drivers,These are the drivers http://www.sybausa.com/resource/SD-PEX20133/SD-PEX20133.ZIP Hope that gets you what you wanted :)
This one VS http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0... - Which one? what's the difference?,This product has the USB ports spaced out and powered by a molex connector. The linked product will fit in lower profile systems and uses sata power for newer systems that provides more current for each port.
This one VS #1 seller by Anker (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00... - what's the difference?,The Anker has the optional 4-pin or 15-pin power connector
I don't have any pci Express x1 on my mother board. Will this adapter plug into a PCI-Express x16 ?,"I plugged it into a x16 port on mine, but it fried a KVM and a USB Audio adapter of mine, so I would advise against getting it to start with."
What batteries do I need?,It takes two AA Batteries
how do you carry it around?,You can carry it in a case specially made for the device. I have one that also has 12 slots to fill them with CD's. I hope that i answered your question my dear friend.
Is there a car adapter for this unit?,No car adapter came with the unit.
"Does this unit work with wifi head phones or do I have to use the ""buds.""","As far as I know, the unit is designed to work with the supplied ear-buds. I was disappointed with the seeming flimsiness of the Walkman, so didn't try it before returning it to Amazon. Therefore, I don't know if you can substitute another pair of earphones."
does the sony have external speakers that permit listening without using the ear bud?,"No, you have to use the ear buds. Excellent sound."
Does it have a resume feature so that it will keep your place when you stop it or turn it off?,Yes.
What is the model number?,D-FJ041
free shipping?,"I don't think so Leroy you need to talk to company about it, I hope that this answers your question my dear friend."
AC DC??,"Yes it has an outlet for extenal power, I hope that tthis answers your question my dear firend."
"I just spoke with Canon who told me NOT to buy aftermarket Batteries, as they may damage my camera. True? or Standard reply to increase Canon Sales?",I don't know if that is true. I just know I have not had any problems with those batteries. The whole package was great on our trip to Europe where I needed to have multiple batteries charged and ready to go.
I just purchased a Canon A2500 PowerShot Digital Camera which came with a Battery Pack NB-11L - Will this Kit fit this model?,"Product Details Halcyon 1400 mAH Lithium Ion Replacement NB-11L Battery and Charger Kit + Memory Card Wallet + SDHC Card USB Reader... $16.99 This is what I get when I look up your camera, its not showing the kit I bought even though the batteries are the same I found you a better deal hope this helps good luck."
Do the charger AC prongs fold back into the charger like the original Cannon? Does the charger have a yel/grn indicator light showing battery status?,"The prongs do fold back into the unit. The orange light is lit for charging, green light when fully charged. I find this easy to use but must must recharge batteries monthly to avoid finding them dead when needed."
"I just got this, and I feel dumb asking it, but how do you get the battery back out of the charger?",On the side of the charger there is a rounded spot where you just push your finger against the battery and lift it out. It will come out fairly easy.
Is thuis battery pack for Cannon #PC1730 ?,According to what I looked up it is the same battery so u can use that battery pack for your Cannon PC1730.
"Descr says for Canon PowerShot A2300 IS. Mine is A2300 ""HD"". Will these batteries fit this also? Just want to be sure! Thanks!",I am not sure these batteries will work. You must do the research on your camera and see if your original batteries will work in the A2300. Some times the manufacturer will change the type of batteries needed because of extra power needed for the newer series camera.
"Will the above batteries fit a Canon Power Shot ELPH 11515 camera? If not, do you have anything else available? Thx","I ordered this kit for my Canon Power Shot A4000 IS so I do not know. I would contact Canon, Best Buy or Staples to see if they might be able to answer this question. Sorry I couldn't answer your question."
the batteries won't fit into my Elph 320hs properly (battery compartment cover won't close) Do I have to remove the white sticker encasing the battery,"My camera is an elph110hs, & no you do not need to remove the white sticker. With the battery door on top & to the right, the ""dc44"" should be viewable & right side up. Battery should slide in & the battery keeper ( lower right corner) should snap over the battery. The door then flips back down & slides back into place."
Will it work on ELPH135 canon camera?,"The package states that it is a ""Replacement Battery for Canon NB-11L"" and is ""compatible with PowerShot A2300, A2400 IS, A3400 IS, A4000 IS, ELPH 110HS, ELPH 320HS and all similar models."""
This is priced at $9.99 on the Apple store site. $14.29 at Amazon?!?!?,"The seller should amend his previous answer. It is currently $14.99 + $3.99 shipping. For comparison, this product sells for $9.99 at Apple + free shipping. I just bought from Apple for nearly half the price."
"Excuse my ignorance, but I'm new to the Mac world. I have a 15"" Pro with retina display. How exactly would I use this item?","On the older MacBook Pros they used a different charger, this adapter allows you to use the older, less expensive charger with the newer MacBookPro."
Does this adapter work with the old T shaped macbook charger (the white one)?,"Not sure Richard's answer was what you are looking for. Apple had two versions of the original MagSafe connector. The first was the T-shaped white one, with the electric contacts at the end of the DC cord, so the cord came straight out of the computer. The second was silver, with the electric contacts at a right angle, so the cord lies against the computer. However, these two styles of cord used exactly the same connector at the computer. Then Apple came out with MagSafe 2, which uses a narrower connector at the computer. This adapter converts a MagSafe plug on the DC cable of an Apple power supply to connect to a MagSafe 2 jack on a computer. It should work with either the original white T-shaped MagSafe DC plug, or with the newer right-angle silver MagSafe DC plug. So the simple answer should be ""yes""."
what is the difference between magsafe and magsafe 2,"MagSafe and ms2 are different size connections to MacBooks. The newer MacBooks and airs have a different magnetic connection but same power need as older ones. I bought a 2013 MacBook Air but had several power supplies from an older air. These allow me to use my power supplies I have in multiple places (travel bag, vacation place, etc.) to change from old to new. And still let's spouse use same power cord for his older macbook. Saved me from spending more on MagSafe 2 power supplies."
Is this item that costs $16.91 after shipping costs are added the same item sold on the Apple website for $13.99 after shipping costs are added?,"It appears to be the same. This isn't shipped directly from Amazon, though, so it's up to the third party seller to decide on their shipping costs. Don't forget to add sales tax. Apple seems to be the better deal right now."
what is the difference between 60W and 85W macbook pro charger,"60W are smaller, made for MacBook Air, 85W are made for the Macbook Pros. You can use a 60W with a Macbook Pro, but it's trickle-charge slow. As far as using this converter - it makes no difference. It works fine on both."
"Must it be a gigabit use only or can it work with any wired ethernet connection regardless of speed? If not, can I buy the USB-ethernet cable instead?","Gigabit ethernet is backwards compatible and should work just fine with any flavor of ethernet. A USB to ethernet adapter, may or may not function at the gigabit speed, but should support other flavors of ethernet just fine. If you want up-to-date technology and maximum speed over ethernet, I would suggest the T'bolt to e'net adapter....my 2"
"this adapter works for my Macbook Pro pretty well, but it does not work for my Air. I tried many times. I do not know where the problem is.",This adapter will work on any Mac with a Thunderbolt port. If it doesn't pick it up you might need to go to System Preferences and then Network and see it is being detected there
I'm wanting to connect my old PC to my new iMac directly to transfer my files faster. I've been transferring via my wifi network. Will this work?,Yes
Can this work with intel next unit it only has a thunderbolt plug and will the speed be any different.,"Hi, I have a NUC model DC3217BY, with firewire and I have used the apple thunderbolt adapter with it. For it to work you will need latest Broadcom Ethernet NetXtreme Desktop/Mobile drivers. You can download them from station-drivers web site. This will give you gigabit networks speeds, way fasters transfer rates of the obtained with any USB 2.0 to Ethernet adapter."
Will the thunderbolt IMAC MD0955LL/A connect to the apple super drive or do I need a thunderbolt to gigabit adapter???,A thunderbolt to gigabit adapter is for connecting from an apple computer without a built-in ethernet port to an ethernet/network/CAT5 cable (hardwire network connection) through the computer's thunderbolt port. You do not want this. The superdrive comes with the USB cable attached. You do not need other cables to use it.
Does it work on an iPad ?,"No, the iPad does not have thunderbolt connection, so it would not work. Only Macs proper have the thunderbolt connection."
"I want to connect my new MacBook Pro to my network via CAT6 cable. CAT6 plug fit into my old MBPro, but not new one. Will this work for me?","I am using this product to connect my macbook pro (late 2012) to the typical connecting wire I use with my router ...I sorry I don't know what a cat6 is etc. but internet pix of cat6 look like my ""typical connecting wire"". thunderbolt to ethernet connector works fine for me and my macbook pro."
"Can this provide wired internet w/o any wireless signal in the environmt, and with the wifi signal turned off of my Mac AirBook?",Yes
what pieces can i use to take iphone hotspot and hardwire out into an ethernet cord to my router?,"This cable is for connecting an Ethernet cord to a computer that doesn't have an Ethernet port (for example a MacBook Air) via the Thunderbolt port. I'm not sure what you mean by 'Iphone hotspot'. If you mean that you're using your Iphone as a personal hotspot, you will a cable like this except with a lightning male end instead of the thunderbolt."
"Hi, I just want to be able to connect my MacBook Air to a standard projector for presentations. Is this what I should buy?","No, you should not buy this adapter. This adapter is for connecting to Ethernet port. It depends on your projector but you should buy either VGA, HDMI or DVI adapter."
"Does this work on the Macbook Air 13 inch, Mid 2013 model?",Yes
what is the difference between a charger and an adapter,"Apple calls these ""adapters"" because they plug into a 110V outlet and have a USB outlet - :adapting"" the wall outlet AC voltage to something that will charge your Mac. You can then plug in whatever cable works for your Mac. Thus it serves as a charger for your Mac. Yes, it would be less confusing if they simply called it a charger but technically it's correct."
"Hi, does this adapter work on both 110-220 Volts outlets?",The adapter is clearly marked: Input 100-240v ~1A 50-60Hz Output: 14.85v 3.05A
Will this work with Mac book air 13 inch mid 2012 version.,I do not know.
"Does this work on macrbook air, 2011 model?","Probably not. 2011 might be first generation, thereby requiring different adapter. Check with Apple. I started with the first generation adapter when I needed an adapter for 2013 model. Also take care of adapter b/c they splinter easily, then you have to end up paying full freight for a replacement"
Does this come with the extension cord like the one that comes with the laptop itself?,Yes.
does this work on macbook air 13inch mid 2012?,Yes! That's what I bought it for.
Will this work with the earlier (version 10.7.5) of the mac air?,I honestly do not know. Try taking a close look at the picture of the plug. It has 5 prongs and is a skinny rectangle.
Is this the one for the early 2014 MacBook Air 13inch?,"Yes I believe do, but it should be easy to confirm on the Apple web site."
Will this work with my late 2010 MacBook Air?,I have a 2011 MacBook Air and this power adapter did not work with it.
does it work with all imac,"No, it doesn't. It won't work with any iMac that was originally built with an internal CD/DVD drive. Per Apple. Amazon should change their description so that potential customers don't fall into the same trap that we did. By the time we realized that for our 2010 iMacs, the drive was an anchor, it was too late to return it."
Can I use this to transfer my music cd's to my Imac?,"Yes, you should be able to. Using the Apple USB Superdrive. I transferred about 40 music and photo CDs using this excellent drive. Very fast. Good luck."
I wanted to watch blu-ray dvd's on my iPad. Looks like that's not possible with the Superdrive. Anybody know if/how that can be done?,"ME Technologies sells a USB Super-BluDrive for $79, which includes software that can play Blu-ray movies. There are also two softwares. One is Aurora Software's Blu-ray Player for $30 android the other is Macgo's Mac Blu-ray Player for $60. Mac Blu-ray is due for a 3.0 update. Both are pretty much the same. Check out their reviews online."
"Got superdrive from Amazon,plugged USB into my MacBook Pro 13"" screen. Discs will not insert completely;they push out like rubber band is pushing them","You have a MacBook Pro that has a built in Superdrive. Per Apple the new, external Superdrive will not work with an of the older, aka Built in Superdrive computers. If you have time to return it, I'd return it to Amazon for a credit."
compatible with windows? I want to use Lightroom on windows laptop then use same files on my mac when I get home. Is this possible?,It should read this just fine....I have used photo discs with this Superdrive with no problems.
Can it convert a cd to an mp3 format and copy it to your iPod?,"Not in and of itself, but if your computer does not have a cd drive (like a MacBook Air, retina MacBook Pro, current Mac mini or IMac) this will allow itunes to read and rip your cd and then convert to mp3"
can this be used as an external hard drive for back up?,"No, this is simply a CD/DVD ROM which is connected to the Mac computers by UBS. In other words they saved lot of space from inside the computer by building USB Superdrive outside. A new idea, but the PC Computers are also using it. Buy an external hard, I always do one TB for every computer! I hope this helps!"
Do you need a mouse to eject CD/DVD's?,"Not at all! Though you CAN use one of course but it's not necessary; when you have a CD or DVD in the drive, it will either have the location reflected on your desktop or iTunes (if your using that application)- otherwise, it most surely would be found on your desktop or drive / program finder. There by the name of the cd or DVD, you will see a tiny arrow pointing down next to it or below it (can't really remember)- you then just move the curser with your trackpad (or mouse) and click on it and you content will eject smoothly."
can i just play a cd or does it go to iTunes,It performs the same drive functions as the built-in one did. Apple primarily built it to accommodate the new iMac and the MacBook Air which are too thin to hold a built-in drive. thin to take a built-in drive.
how long is the usb cord on the apple superdrive ?,"It's 1 foot. You need to find space very near your computer when you want to use it. On the other hand, when it's not in use, the Superdrive stores handily in a desk drawer."
Does this fit an ipad air?,Yes
Will this work well with the Kindle ereader?,"It depends on the eReader size. If it is the 7"" version then yes, it should work fine but if the 6"" version then no, I don`t believe so... I have used it with my Kindle Fire HD but it was definitely not as tight a fit as with the iPad."
Does the company make a stand holder for a 12.2 tablet?,I don't know
I'm having a very hard time adjusting the bracket down to fit my mini iPad as they don't easily move. Am I missing something?,"I had the same problem! Ended up breaking one side out! I still use it as it does adjust for me one way at least! I am using it for an 8"" tab."
Will it hold ipad-mini up even if you turn the ipad screen to face the ground? (ex: if you're lying in bed &amp; want to watch a movie lying on your back),Yes
are you able to play fast paced action games using this stand (without it wobbling or falling)?,No
"would this work for a 10.5 inch tablet, namely the Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5?",Yes
"wanted to use this for a DIY photo booth at my daughters birthday with an iPad mini, is it sturdy enough?","It should be yes. The stand is essentially just a normal microphone stand and the base is wide enough to be very stable. The bendy end to it is definitely sturdy enough to hold a mini (I use it with a normal iPad currently), stay in place and not slip down. It is configurable to many sizes and I believe the mini is one of them... I currently use as a bedside holder to watch tv and knock it regularly and it is fine :)"
Do you think this stand could be modified to hold physical books?,Probably not very effective for most books.
Will it hold a ipad mini,Yes... But I did not have good luck with this item. I have not had it long and it is BROKEN already :0( Good Luck.
Is this a genuine Apple or a knock off....,Genuine Apple.
Does this come with the extension cable? If not do you sell it?,It is included and removable.
How long is the cord?,"The thicker cord that goes into the wall outlet is 6' and the thin cord that goes to the computer is 5' 6"""
"Is this for both the 13"" and 15"" MBP w/Retina?",I have a 15 in and I'm pretty sure it works for 13
what are the dimensions of the actual brick?,"I measured the brick with a ruler and it is 3 3/16"" square, and 1 1/8"" high; however, since the edges/corners are rounded, I estimate that these measurements could be off by 1/16"". I compared it to the original brick, and it looks to be between 1/16"" to 1/8"" larger, in both length, width, and depth."
Is it a t shaped 5 pin adapter with 85W 18.5 v-4.6A?,It is as shown with the cable coming straight out of the side of the macbook. It is not the style that exits toward the back.
Can I use this with a late 2011 macbook pro?,no
How long is the extension cable?,"The 120 v side is about 4 feet, and the low voltage side is about the same."
"Just bought 15"" MBP w/ Retina &amp; needing another cord so I have one @ work and @ home. Is this like the cord from the box? My cord doesn't say wattage.","Hi Stephanie, the MBP 15 comes with the 85w MagSafe 2"
"Will this work with early 2008 15"" Macbook Pro?","You need the std 85w MagSafe, not the 85w magsafe 2 You have an older style tip that looks similar to the 2 series charger, but it's actually smaller. The std charger with the tubular style tip is the perfect fit"
"how can I play the music I have on my I phone, or I pod on this radio ?",you plug your cell phone into the radio using the 1.5 jack and then hit the AUX button on the radio
how does ant for radio work or do you need and exteranl one also what speakers should one use ?,"Yes you'll need an external antenna to get any signal at all. I used a set of poly planar's water proof speakers. As long as you keep within the radio output specifications, you should be fine"
will it read a flash drive through the usb input?,Yes it will read a flash drive
"Okay, the only way to get mine working is to plug something into the USB jack. Then sound will come. Turn unit off, have to repeat process.ANYBODY?",These units are very sensitive to ground they ground when both nuts are secure to the chanel shaped mounting hoop. sounds like the metal on the usb might be making it ground and it starts to play but unpluged it won't.
can you turn off/ on this radio,"Yes, awesome radio"
what is th USB port for,A flash drive with music will play. I pligged in my phone but it only charged it. Great radio though. You dony have to cut anything out if you have room on your console. Glad I bought it!
will this remote work with jensen model msr3012 radio,it is the radio
Can I use the line out to connect a subwoofer amp and still use the other speaker connections from this unit?,"Short answer is yes. The signal goes out of both the high and low outputs together. I tried it. It worked but I realized to get enough volume to the sub to make it sound good, you were distorting the power to the speakers. They were also really drowned out by the sub. My recommendation and what I ended up doing was to get a 4 channel amp, bridging two channels for the sub and using the other two channels for the speakers. With the amp crossovers, you can really dial in the sound and get the best bang out is the sub. Good luck."
can i connect an amp for the rear channel and run the front off of the deck itself,"There is one set of pre amp outputs, but they aren't fader specific. My suggestion, use the rear outputs off of the radio as ""high level"" inputs into your amplifier. Most amps have this option!"
Can I power the stereo with a traditional wall plug? Should I be aware of any voltage problems?,"No, this is a 12v application not 110. Very different! You'd have to get a 12v to 110v converter."
"Am I correct in that a computer is necessary to set up the Web600 but after set up, no computer is necessary?",Yes that is correct. Unit connects to you network and send text and emails
What happens with the Web600 when you have a power/Internet outage? The 400 uses a landline and will auto-dial using its battery to notify of outage.,Power and internet outages are of such short duration here it is of no concern to me except I do use a battery backup. One thing to be very concerned about when considering the 600 is you do need a static IP address or you will loose remote communication with the 600. This I learned the hard way. My internet provider charges $10/month extra to have a static IP address. Had I known this before getting the 600 it would have been a deal breaker.
Does the Web600 have a mic/speaker to alert to other alarms?,No - though it has a relay which can be used as an on-off switch to activate an audio unit.
does the web600 make telephone calls via the internet or does it just send email alerts,It just sends emails.
Do these adapters that can be used to monitor other locations (such as multiple refrigerators) have to be hooked up with wires or can this be done wir,I have mine hard wired. I don't think wireless is an option. Call the company they would know. I love my web600
"I want to make sure this model is the one with the relay output like the picture shows, correct?","Yes ; it has the relay output ; I purchased one of these a few months ago; and the documentation wasn't clear, but it has the relay output."
Which webmail do you use with port 25?. I couldn't use any with the smtp setup,You need to call Sensaphone...they have excellent and very quick and responsive team of Tech Support people. They have helped me many times solve problems.
"Is this camera the U.S model, or an import model? Does it come with the full U.S. warranty?","If it does not come with a US warranty, it is gray market, and Amazon should not allow it."
How is a low light performance?,I've used it in some very challenging light conditions and it performed excellently.
Does this camera have an HD-SDI or an HDMI output for live video production?,Excellent Camera......Don't need any other....Yes handles both out HD-SDI and HDMI..... Great Zoom....
What is the difference between the standard AG-AC160 and this model?,"This model, the one with the ""A"", records in 60p/50p in 1080. which wasn't available in the previous versions. The PJ I think means that this product is to be sold in Japan. But it still has english interface and all that. I hope I helped :)"
if it comes with the memory card and the battery,"a battery comes with it by default, mine didn't come with a memory card."
Does this unit come with the standard 1 year warranty that can be upgraded to 3 years with online registration?,"Yes, only if you register with online"
Is the color codec 4:2:2 ?,"No, It is color compression rate. 4:4:4 uncompressed video, raw video"
"Hi the price on this camera is GREAT. Is this Product New, Open Box, B-Stock, Reconditioned. Does it come with the Standard USA Warrenty?","it came to me new and an unopened box. because I don't live in USA, I didn't pay that attention to it when I opened the box. (I think) it came with it, yeah."
Will it work on ipad mini,"It should work, works good on iPad 2 gen and the latest one, even used on itouch. I like it directs music, sound forward to user."
Does it stay on if you have an ipad case,It will but you will want to take it off it you put it in a bag it you'll lose it.
does this work on a KindleFire HD 8.9?,Don't know as I don't have a Fire. But it seems to be specifically made for the iPad 2 and later.
does it work with an iphone 4,iPhone 4 has a different speaker configuration due to larger older model charging plug input .. However it seems like it would still work well . I have the iPhone 5 .. for what this device it cost.. its certainly worth a try..
does this work with original iPad?,Yes it does!
I assume after casette tape is transferred I can burn CD,"Yes. My husband transferred some old cassette audio tapes to his hard drive with this item, and then burned a CD. Works well. Very happy with results."
Is this product MAC compatible?,"The cassette player itself is MAC compatible. The software that comes with it is not. You will need to use a free program called Audacity to use the cassette recorder with your MAC. After you import using Audacity, you can then either keep using Audacity, or you can use various MAC audio tools to edit the .mp3."
"I have cassettes with long family conversations I'd like to convert. Since some have said it only does one song at a time, wondering if it will work.","It will record until you press the stop button in Audacity, so you can record a whole side of a cassette in one go. However, if you want to separate individual songs from an album, so you can save them as individual digital files, you need to record one song at a time."
Can this be used just as a battery operated cassette walkman type player or USB powered only?,there is a battery compartment inside where the tape goes it takes two aa batteries so the answer is yes
how can i get my tape to mp3 converter to work,"Don't use the CassetteMare software. It doesn't work. Use the Audacity software that's also provided on the CD in the package, then follow the instructions provided with the Audacity software, not the Audacity instructions in the manual provided in the package. That manual is useless. With a little effort, you can convert tapes to mp3s using Audacity."
"Dear FONESO, I purchased the Handy USB Cassette Player and Tape-to-MP3 Digital Converter. Stereo playback doesn't work. What can I do?","Here are some suggestions. They may seem obvious solutions, but hopefully one of these will help you... -Check your computer's speaker volume level -Check the volume on the cassette player -Check the playback volume on the Audacity program's volume level is turned up -Make sure that the player is plugged into the microphone port and not the headphone port (if you did accidently plug it into the headphone port, then the Audacity program did not record any of it and you'll need to completely re-download the cassette recording)"
I need just a simple playing cassette player we are teaching our grandson hooked on phonics,"This would probably work although it's not very durable, so keep that in mind. There is a headphone jack connection and also a place for batteries so you don't need to use the USB connection."
Does this record 320kbps Mp3s??,"Not sure. See if this makes any sense to you:The number of computer bits conveyed or processed per unit of time. Normally expressed in kilobits per second (kbps). For an uncompressed, PCM file, kbps bit rate is sample rate multiplied by sample format mutiplied by number of channels, divided by 1000, giving 1411 kbps for Red Book WAV or AIFF. Rates are much lower for compressed or lossy formats and are independent of sample rate for MP3. All I know is that you can convert into various formats. I do MP3, but you can also do MP4, WAVE, FLAC (I think)... The only way for me to check that for you is to record something and then open the Export option and it gives you a choice of format. If this info doesn't help, let me know, and I will hook it back up and record a sample and see. It is a really good gadget and easy to operate. I haven't used the splicing and editing mode, but it offers a lot of functions for editing, etc. I recommend this. The above info was taken from the Help info supplied with the program."
Do I have to play one song at a time to get my songs off the cassette?,No
Can you listen to the tapes without the headphones? (Our library has lots of books on tape - but my daughter would not like to wear the headphones.),Yes. I have never used headphones.
"It says there is a HDD case but not shown in photos, is there one?","Yes, it comes with a small plastic housing for a HDD. Nothing fancy, but I'm able to pop mine in and it fits securely. A bit of an added pain to plug in the SATA cable while it's in there, but it works fine."
Can I use this to transfer files from a dead laptop harddrive to a new laptop without taking the harddrive out of the new laptop?,"You will need to take the hard drive out of the broken laptop. That hard drive would then plug in to the large end, then plug the two USB ends in to the new laptop. But this will only work if your old drive is a SATA drive. If it is a very old IDE drive it will not work. (IDE Drives are the old hard drives that have two rows of small pins on the). Removing a hard drive from a laptop is super easy. You will probably find videos on your specific laptop on YouTube."
will this work on a sata 500gb drive?,Yes! It works on mine just fine.
"Plugged it in and my PC is recognizing the cable but not the HDD, HDD is also silent. I made sure to format the driver earlier, and it's worked before","Unplug and replug the cable into the hard drive and the computer. There are many tiny connectors, and sometimes if the plug is even a little crooked it won't work. If that doesn't work, try it with another hard drive, to see if it's the adapter, or your drive. Also, if you are trying to use only one USB plug, use the one in the middle of the cord. The plug on the end is just for extra power (in case a single USB port doesn't have enough juice to power up the drive; I've never had to use it)."
"as soon as i came in the mail, i plugged it in to my 8.1 lab top and used it on my 300gb, 500gb and my 1500tb and nothing happened,",Hellow kyle the thing is diffirent beetwin this is you can only use the hdd for sata/laptops hdd if you are using big hdd like computers/desktop etc it won't work however it will works fine on small hdd just plug it and go to system bios and click boot usb hdd or boot usb thanks.
Does this work with 3.5 inch hard drives or only with 2.5 in?,I tried it with a 3.5 inch hard drive and couldn't get it to work. It uses the USB port to supply power to the hard drive and the sata drive would not start. I tried a different adapter that used power from an AC outlet and that one worked great. I was able to connect to my laptop via USB and get all the data off of the drive. Not sure I am allowed to say which drive that was but I can tell you it cost less too.
is it necessary to use both usb connections or will one suffice?,"Yes, one is for data and the other is for power. Sometimes a USB port won't supply enough power through one port. I have used an adapter that just had one USB. This one does require the use of both."
Will this work on a Hiachi Type TS5SAA320 320 GB SATA 3.0 Gb/s?,It should work with all SATA drives. Don't know if this particular drive fits in the case they give you. But the cable should work.
It works on windows 7 and 8?,"Yes, it will work on on both Windows 7 and 8."
its says 7200 will this work on a 5400?,Yes you can! Else you can just return it
it glues onto the screen ?,Sticks on. You can peel it off without any residue. Like a removable sticker
Is it case sensitive? will my case cause it to bubble in the corner?,I have an Otter Box over it for over 2years no problems. Any tiny bubbles were gone in a day or so after application. Have it on 2 other units too all same
How protective is it,"The protector fully covers the screen. For as long as I've had it on the phone, I've never had a scratched screen, and my grand boys are always using my phone. It had held up to the rugged use by a 2, 3, 5, and seven year old boy!"
Can this replace the clear part of the otter box cover for iphone 4s,"Yes, I used this screen protector instead of the screen protector included with the OtterBox cover."
"Is it locked or unlocked? If locked, which is the internet subscriber?",This armor will work on an unlocked or locked iPhone from any Internet subscriber.
does it fit the iphone 4s well?,It fits the iphone perfectly
is it equal to the Apple produc,This product was better than the Apple product I was replacing.
Would somebody PLEASE tell me what an otterbox is?,"haha, its a company that sells cases for iphones mostly 4/4s. go to www.otterbox.com"
One of the corners of my husbands screen protector is not sticking and keeps lifting up. How do you support your warrenty?,Contact the seller.
Is there Screen Protector both front and back or just front side?,It is just for the screen. I use an otterbox also. But you do get two in this pack.
Is this package coming with two sheets (front &amp; back)?,"It comes with 3 sheets, but they go on the front only. It is a protector for the screen of the phone only. A case will protect the back and sides, but you will need to purchase one separately."
Is the screen scratch-proof,I had the privacy screen version but it was the same brand from the time that I have had it (about a year) it didn't scratch.
Does the Protector work with a Speck case?,I don't know specifically for Speck but FYI it doesn't go 100% to the edge of the screen (about 0.5mm from the edge all the way around so i think it would be perfect. I have a Belkin that is 100% around the screen and works perfectly with no edge lift from the protector.
"Would it be fair to say that the Matte protector is more smudge/glare proof, but the HD protector is more crisp/clear?","That's hard to say, because it's all really subjective. Honestly, I wouldn't believe anyone that said their product is smudge free because that's never true. I can smudge anything that claims to be smudge free. Haha! As far as the HD protector being more crisp/clear, I would say that's subjective too because not all people have the same eyes. But on a serious note, I only purchased this product because as a screen protector, I know it works. The iphone has been dropped from a height about 3 - 4 feet, several times now since the purchase, and it has held up."
"How is the touch sensitivity of THIS ""Matte"" screen protector, compared to the Tech Armor ""HD"" screen protector?",The touch sensitivity of this matte screen works great. I don't experience any lag or feel that I need to press harder than normal.
Does it work with an otterbox commuter case?,Yes it does. That's what I have too. They are perfect! Love them. Would recommend highly.
"I have the Iphone4 with the Mopie that slides over the Iphone, will the screen protector work with the Mopie?","Hi Donna -- I have a Mophie on my iPhone myself, which I love by the way! Yes, the Tech Armor works perfectly as it sits right on the screen -- no overlapping on to base of the the phone itself. I think you will be very pleased if you chose to go with Tech Armor. Joni"
I just bought this. I also need a completely white back protector skin. Any suggestions?,Skinit has pre-made and custom skin protectors for all Apple devices. I bought one for my girlfriends iPad and she loves it. Can be purchased through Amazon or directly from Skinit.
I don't see the extra cut-out on the top for the iPhone 4s. I only see two cut-outs. Is there a different screen cover that is for the 4s only?,I have it on my iPhone 4s right now. There are three cutouts. One on the bottom and two on the top. the two on the top are for the camera and the speaker. That's all that's needed. The screen protector is great and my phone works just fine.
Does this make taking photos any easier?,"Based on my wife's usage, and believe me she takes about 50-100 pictures a day; she has told me that she can see the screen better, no more glare on the screen before/after taking picture. Because of the privacy portion of the screen protector, when showing people pictures on the iPhone, they have to either look over her shoulder or hold the phone itself to see the pictures clearly, looking at them from the side are obstructed. Hope this helps? Overall my wife is very pleased with the screen protector."
It says there are 3 screen protectors but I only received 1 in the box. Is there supposed to be 3 or is that a misprint?,"If it says it's a 3-pack then yes there should be 3. Some are a 1 only pack. There is a sticker on bottom of package that states, 3 screen protectors. If you are not satisfied email customersupport@techarmor.com"
Can the privacy screen saves mobile from drops ?,"It probably provides an extra degree of buffer from most ""normal"" drops, but unlikely from harder ones for which, a case would be a wiser choice."
How do I do a warranty replacement?,"LaTonya H, thanks for your question. To obtain a replacement on your purchase contact us directly and give us your order number, shipping address and an image of the damage to your screen protector. Best, Tech Armor Support"
Is it a glass screen protector or is it plastic?,Plastic
Do these work with the Ballistic SG case for iphone4?,"Liz R. I need to change my response!! After looking at the Ballistic case and buying one myself for my iPhone 6, this screen protector will not be a good choice! I recommend instead getting a ZAGG Invisible Shield which works with every case. It stops short of the edges so that no case will effect your screen protector. Plus Techarmor makes terrible case protectors and they do not honor their ""Hassle Free Lifetime Warranty"" I recommend this one: http://www.amazon.com/ZAGG-InvisibleShield-Glass-Apple-iPhone/dp/B00NLJ3NPG#"
I have to remove and replac my Tech Armor screen because I chipped off a corner. How do I remove the glass protector?,"Just start at one corner and using either your fingernail or something's that can lift the screen off the glass, like a credit card or something, and begin by lifting it up and away from the glass. Using a cleaner safe to use on your phone or electronic screens clean the screen and dry and then finish wiping with a lint free cloth. Then simply re apply your new one just like the last one. Good luck"
Will the Speck Toughcase work with this Ballistic glass screen protector ?,I am sorry I do not know I used it for my iPhone 4 s and it is so great took off old one and put on new one in a jiffy so much cheaper than store
"one of the tech armor products is ballistic glass, how thick is the glass and is it worth paying the extra money over the other tech armor products?","Yes but DO NOT get the one sold by Tech Armor, it is junk and the company will not honor their warranty if anything goes wrong. Instead buy the ZAGG InvisibleShield Glass for Apple iPhone - Case Friendly. Trust me, if that one does you wrong, I will personally reimburse you!! Lol"
Will the Tech Armor Ballistic GLASS Screen Protector work with an Otterbox Commuter case? Thanks for your help!,"I doubt it worked for you, if it did it will soon get ruined and you will try to get a refund or new one and Tech Armor will likely choose not to honor their ""Hassle Free Lifetime Warranty"". Get a ZAGG InvisibleShield Glass for Apple iPhone - Case Friendly instead :)"
how thick is this glas cover?,It's not glass.
what's in the box? is power cord and dash board holder included?,Yes...To Both Questions. But Dash Mount Is A Sticky Mount. It Also Comes With A Suction Cup Mount For Windshield. That'sThe Mount I Use And It WorkS Great.
which is better? XRS 9970G or Vedetta SLR 650G?,"I have had both the 9970g and currently using the vendetta... I lean more towards the 9970g more seemed to pick up way more, tell when emergency vehicles approaching, and railroad alerts. Kind of got annoying but worked great"
Which is better? XRS 9965 or Vedetta SLR 650G?,Vedette easier to read and less false alarms.
Will this unit detect Red Light/ Speed Cameras?,"When you plug it in to your computer, the Cobra will download all the latest camera locations. GPS will need to be working while driving and then it will indicate you are getting close to a known camera location."
The description references GPS. Does this unit also serve as a GPS unit for directions?,No. The GPS function serves as accurate speed if the vehicle. It also serves the purpose of photo enforcement cameras ect.
Does it detects photo radars?,yes it does. I've had this for about 4 months and it works very well on just about everything except the guy behind you pacing you.
IS SLR 650G also a 15 band radar?,Yes
"What are the major differences between the SLR500, 600 and 650G. Is it worth the extra cost?","The G offers the GPS uploads Free from cobra. You just sync your 650G with the only database and it marks things like known speed traps, High traffic accident locations.. and stuff like that. Mine has warned me numerous times with the speedtrap alert when the posted road speeds just changed. I am very happy with mine and I have make several trips from Nashville TN, to Detroit Mi."
"my screen is upside down when in the upright posistion, how do i change this back",I belive there is a button on left side hold in to change display look up manual on internet once you know how it is quick to change I have manual but not with. Me now. U canemail me if u need more help steve5980@yahoo.com
does anyone know where i can get instructions to hardwire this unit. thx,This should help you: http://cobra.factoryoutletstore.com/cat/35145/Radar-Detectors.html
Is this case also compatible with Galaxy Tab 10.1? (Not the Galaxy Tab 2),"The Tab is 10.3 x 7.1 x .35 . The Tab 2 is 10.1 x 6.9 x .38 . Since the specs don't match and the case is a friction fit, I'm guessing no."
Does it turn the tablet off when you close the case like an iPad does.,"No, it does not. The iPad uses magnets in the smart cover to do it. the galaxy tab does not have this feature. The buttons are easily accessible and as you secure the cluster, it is less than an inch away from the power button."
Does it have the ViPeR head emblem on it as you see in the shared images? And the receipt didn't say VPR Premium...but said Exotek Premium??,My case has the VIPeR head emblem on the lower right corner of the top cover. My receipt has this listed as a VPR premium. Hope this helps
Does this fit the Galaxy Note 10.1?,Hi. I don't know. The one I reviewed fits the galaxy tab 10.2
How does it stay closed,"If you observe the picture, the flat surface has a knob/latch at the end. It latches in quite tight and is easy to pull and release too. No problems there."
Does it have a place to put the Stylus Pen on it?,No
will this accomodate nthe Dell XPS10 ??,I actually have new clue what the dell xps 10 looks like but if its the same dimensions as the samsung tab 2 then it is possible. I suggest you compare the dimensions of the Samsung tab 2 and your dell xps10.
Does this fit for the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1?,Yes it fits perfectly :)
does this have a strap in the back for your hands,No it doesn't have a strap
Is there a circle opening for the camera,you can see it on the second and sixth image of the product
Does it come with batteries ?,"No, it does not"
How batteries are inserted into the grip,"they are inserted through the side, slide out magazine."
Will L plates designed for the Canon grip (e.g. Really Right Stuff BGE11-L) fit this one?,"not up to par with the Canon version, doesn't really work with AA batteries, some technical malfunctions as well."
What would I use to extend the length of the cable?,I would get a coaxial cable and a coaxial cable adaptor to connect the cable and the extension.
August DTA415 High Gain Digital TV Antenna Any Comments On This Antenna Does It Bring In Any channels?,"Yes, considering its size it does a very good job but placement is very important as is true of all indoor antennas. Attach additional coax cable and move it around in the room. In one location in a room I found it even did a good job on VHF channels 7-13 where most indoor antennas fail. Considering the price and size it does a very good job bringing all local channels at a distance of 25 airline miles."
What is the width of the antenna?,"4.5""X1""X1 "" and is less than 3oz but it is a little powerhouse. I am still using it to pick up a station thats opposite direction of other tower. I stuck it to a window."
Included USB cable conection for this antena,There is no USB cable for this. It is just an antenna that connects to an F-Type antenna connector on a TV or other device.
Can I connect to any other device or tablet,These are made for iPads If your tablet has the same connector as the iPad it will work fine
is this compatible for a mini ipad?,We got it for the bigger iPad. So no I don't think it would work
Will this case fit an Ipad 2?,"Yes, my husband has an iPad 2 and it fit perfectly."
Will this case fit the newest IPad Air?,Not sure. I don't have the I PAD Air.
Mine does not have anything sticking out the side to turn on/off? Do I push down on the rubber like the Bluetooth button or should there be something,"Have you charged it? The keyboard has to be charged first. Then once it's charged, on the side there is a small (you can barely feel it) switch. Make sure your ipad is set to bluetooth."
Is this case available for the ipad mini?,This item is not available for the iPad Mini. We apologize for the inconvenience. Brian Customer Service
Can someone tell me how the keyboard works?,"it is ""Blue Tooth"". Turn on blue tooth on the ipad and it will find the device(Keypad). then just click on it. hope this helps."
"I got this case from someone but without the manual, so how could I turn it on/off? does the red light means it on or off? how to connect it to ipad?","Thank you for your inquiry. Per our warehouse we have provided the information you requested below: - To turn product on/off, this keyboard as a on/off button next to the usb port. - To connect it to an iPad, use a USB cord. - The red light means it is charging.

Do you need to take the iPad out of the case to take a picture?,I bought it for my husband who has the iPad 3 and it fits perfectly. It has not been out of the case since he got it. He loves it. No problem with the camera at all
Can it fit a 13.3 size tablet,It fit my I pad 2 but not my mini I pad
Does this specific case /keyboard fit the iPad mini ?,I don't believe so. I purchased it specifically for the iPad 2 so that it would have the opening for the rear camera so to large for the mini.
is this for the ipad mini,I am using it for my iPad....not a mini.
is this for the ipad mini,"No, regular iPad 3."
What are the real dimensions of the board (HxWxD)?,"I believe it is easiest to give you the dimensions in metric. These are + or - 1mm 53mm wide, 38mm deep, 13mm high. Height can vary because there is a ""tuning"" screw for adjusting output that moves up or down, but adjusts over about 1mm distance."
Can this be used to regulate a wind turbine to 13v so no matter what output voltage it is able to charges a 12v battery? Would we need a diode?,"Hi,Dear yes,it can."
Does the unit have a under-voltage lockout feature?,"I have no idea. I honestly wish I did, but I don't."
What are the total dimensions of the unit? the other answer conflicts with the product info,"It's 1 1/2"" by 2 1/16"" with a total depth of 3/4"" which includes spacer mounts."
"If I set this to 28.4v, will it work to charge 24v battery from 12v solar panel?","Yes, it should work. You'd honestly be better off getting a second solar panel and wiring them in series to produce 24v."
I have fixed DC 21V terminals on HO scale train power supply. Want to drop to 15V. Will this work?,Yes
I have one signal of 5v and i need open one electric lock (door access) of 12 V? I can used it for convert my signal of 5v to 12v?,That depends on the power / current requirements of your door lock. If it is a 1A 12V lock then that means your input current would have to be 2.4A even if the buck/boost converter was 100% energy efficient and had no loss. Since there will be conversion losses your input current (for a 1A 12V load) is probably at the 3A maximum rating for this converter. If your lock requires more then 1A then this is not the correct DC-DC converter to use for your application. Also make sure that your signal source can supply 5V at the required current. If the input voltage drops because of the load then the input current will increase even further.
I want to us e this as a multiple fan controller for my pc will this work?,I don't see how this product relates to that goal.
Am I reading the description right. Can I set the output voltage for 5v and have it remain constant as long as the input voltage is between 3.5-28v,I didn't have much luck with these. Voltage changed when a load was connected.
will this work for both the ipad and ipad 2?,Yes it does.
Will it fit my asustf300,Not familiar with that but it fits iPad 4 but just a little too big for iPad air. It slips around ondide
Does it fit the new iPad lightweight 64gb,I have the 3rd iPad and it fits. I don't know about the new lightweight one. Go Pack Go!
Does this tablet work with Mac? Snow Leopard- Lion?,It probably works with both bc you insert a cd for the set up
"is the pen battery powered? if so, with what battery?",Yes and it uses AAAs
is it compatible with linux?,Don't know.. I'm using on a Mac OS X 10.8 and with parallels running Windows 7. .it works on both of those.
How does it display....Through a computer screen...or on its own screen?,through the computer screen
Where can I get new stylus pen tips from?,not from Genius unless you want to order a whole new pen. I found universal tips for the pen on ebay. 10 for 5.55
Does this device come with the corel and elements INCLUDED? I bought a wacom board about a year ago on Amazon and it claimed it had them and didnt,Yes it comes with the corel painter essentials 4
"can it be used in conjunction with ""quick mask"" in photoshop?",yes
Will this work on windows 8?,Yes it will
is it used?,Yes and it works very well.
can this be used with a Bose Wave/CD player?,Yes. The Cube is a very clear and solid sound speaker
Can I connect this to the TV?,"Sorry, I am not sure and never try before. I connected to the Bose Media Centre Player."

What's the wattage?,200W
Can someone please tell me what the height and width measurements are across the front of speaker? Thanks,"it is 6"" X 2 1/2"" on the face and 3 3/4"" in the back"
Can I connect speaker to TV?,Yes
What is the impedance of this speaker?,8 ohms
can I connect directly to my reciever,No. It is designed to be connected through a Bose subwoofer. It does not mean that it will not produce sound with other receivers but it will be flat and may eventually get damaged. For Bose subwoofers only. Loose~lips~sink~ships Sent from iPhone 6 Via international
is this wireless and has blue tooth feature,"No, its a typical wired speaker. Great sound."
What is the minimum power supply wattage required?,I have my GT 640 running with 350W power supply.
Will this be compatible with a Dell XPS 400 Tower?,Yes but it is not much of an upgrade over the 6800 that came with your computer. A nice entry level card. I use it for video streaming to my tv thru the computer and it works great. Good luck
Will this be compatible with a Dell XPS 8300 Desktop?,"Looking at the specs of the Dell 8300 xps, I don't think there should be any incompatibility issues."
Is this powered with a generic 6 pin power cable?,"No, just uses a ePCI slot."
"It is possible to make a connection to triple video heads ""triple head2go""",It only drives 2 displays at a time
Will this be compatible with a Dell Inspiron 3847 Desktop?,Yes it will work as long as you have an Intel processor mother board with a PCI Express duel width x16 slot - minimum 350 watt or greater power supply - 300mb hard drive space - 2gb or better system memory - from what I could fine out about your computer it will work fine - Im using mind in and old dell xps410 intel Motherboard - It will work in AMD Motherboard system but it will be glitchy and slow - also it works in a Pci Express 2.0 slot even though it's supports 3.0 - I bought it to use in my new system I built and wasn't happy with it's performance lots of issues - Of course my new system is built with AMD Motherboard - so I put it in my old Dell with Intel and it's performing like it's suppose too. It's a great card just do your homework to make sure your system can handle it - what I found online your good as long as you have no power supply issues - Hope this helped
Will this work with ASUS M4A88T-M / USB3 motherboard?,"I'm not familiar with that specific mobo, but if it has a PCI- e slot on it, that video card will work and has been a great video card for me"
compatible board pci express 2.0 is board ASUS M5A97 R2.0 AM3+ AMD 970 SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.0,Sorry so no :( The mainboard works with PCIx 2.0 and the video card is PCIx 3.0
pci express 2.0 ? compatible ASUS M5A97 R2.0 AM3+ AMD 970 SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.0 ATX AMD Motherboard,"If you have Pci-x slot, and you do, it should work just fine..... sure like mine"
will this card work with an ASUS P5L-MX motherboard?,"As long as your board has a PCIe-x slot, and according to the specs it does, ... it should work just fine."
I have 2 HP Elite L2201x screens....Each one of them has 1 displayport. Will this work?,Yup.
Does this work with the Surface Pro 2 tablet?,Yes
Will this work with an iMac with (2) TB/DP mini ports?,Short answer is YES... It will work if you have a mini to mini cable to replace the full-sized DisplayPort to miniDP cable included. This unit does have the ThunderBolt/MiniDP size connector.
"I can get the Adapter to Mirror the display, how do you get the expanded mode?",Didn't work for me had to return it
"@Zoltan, so you used this to extend (not mirror) your display? I have a Mac and would like to use two external monitors with different information.","Yes, it does extend the display. But from my experience it is transparent to the computer, so the computer has no idea that there are 2 monitors. Therefore if you set any window to ""full screen"" it will span across both monitors. This is different (and not quite as handy) as other dual monitor solutions where the computer is aware of both monitors."
DellUP2414Q UHD gives only2calibration slots per input so I want to hook PC to it&amp;toggle between DP&amp;mDP inputs so I get 4 calibrations. This works?,"I didn't know the answer off the top of my head, so I looked it up on the Lenovo site, which stated, in relevant part: Lenovo DisplayPort to Dual DisplayPort Adapter (0B47092) provides multi-monitoring at its finest without the use of an expensive graphics card. The two modes supported are Expanded mode and Mosaic mode. In Expanded mode, one ThinkCentre DisplayPort can be connected to two identical monitors with one DisplayPort to Dual DisplayPort Adapter and two Options DisplayPort cables (0A36537). In Quad Mosaic mode, two ThinkCentre DisplayPorts can be connected to four identical monitors with two DisplayPort to Dual DisplayPort Adapters and four DisplayPort cables. Maximum resolution in Quad Mosaic mode supported is 3840 x 2160. I hope this answers your question."
I have one Display port output from my HP. I need to split to two display port (male) from my ASUS 1920 x 1200 ProArt screens. Will this box support?,"it may treat the screens as two 1080p screens instead of 1200p, but yes it should work. I have four asus proart screens with this setup myself."
"Max resolution support? (Surface Pro 2 outputs 3,840 x 2,160) I'd like to run 2 monitors at 2560x1600.",It is impossibe 2560 two monitor. 3840*2160 -&gt; can split two 1920*1200
I have two computers and one monitor. Can this work with that?,As long as your computer has the DisplayPort outputs.
does this support extended image from pc? will it mirror the image on 2 monitors or can be used to display 2 diffrent images?,It can do both. Mirror or be used for seperate monitor
How can one get a HD cable that fit the space in the computer to connect to TV screen?,"you need to buy a miniDisplay to HDMI convert,Hope I can Help U"
What does the premium have that the Economic does not?,"If memory serves, the premium includes the base with the dvd player. The economy version does not, so you'd have to purchase a dvd player drive separately."
Is this the touch screen version?,yes--can use finger or digital pen
Does this come with the ultrabase dock and is it the tablet version?,"Hello, Yes, it comes with Ultra Base (DVD/RW in it), and it's Tablet PC. Best regards, Amuras"
Does this unit have the slot to add a smart card reader?,"If I remember correctly, X230 Tablet can have either ExpressCard 34/54 slot or Smart Card slot, it's configured at the factory, reseller's can't changed that. This model comes with the ExpressCard Slot, and, actually, all reseller models will have that. Smart Card can probably put in there if you remove the ExpressCard housing and replace it with Lenovo's Smart Card housing, but this is not an easy task, I would think, and Lenovo doesn't sell these parts on the open market. Not sure if you can even find it. Normally, end users simply add a USB-based external Smart Card reader instead."
can you give me serial number and warranty from lenovo? thank you,"take the battery out from the back, your serial number is written there. the warranty is based on your purchase date, so if you need to have it fixed , they will need the bill of sales to prove this date, warranty is two years."
can you ship to Beirut -Lebanon,"No, we are sorry but we don't ship over-seas."
Does it come with a digitizer pen? Has anyone tried to take notes (handwriting) with the pen? Does it work well?,"Yep it does, and i did tried it out and let me tell you it is a superb laptop:) When i got it, it had Win 7 as OS the experience using a digitize pen is really awesome, although it doesn't work efficiently on the corners but about anything else it is great device. And my experience was better after i upgrade it to Win 8.1. Lenovo they really did a great job here, there is another draw back that it is a little heavy and you need to buy a docking station to have a dvd-rom and HDMI input."
I ordered this product last week but I am really confused now. Is it X230 (not convertible) or X230T (a convertible)?,"What I bought is: ThinkPad X230 34352TU 12.5"" LED Tablet PC - Core i7 i7-3520M 2.9GHz - Black and it is a convertible). I had a view to the company page from Lenovo before I bought and good the right one. You my phone the seller to make it clear to meet your expectation! Hartmut"
"Does the ThinkPad X230 34352TU come with the Multitouch keyboard. If not, what model does?","Yes, my one is with multitouch."

Can I charge my SOlar Monkey directly through the wall socket in Europe?,"Hi Ingham, Thank you for your question for Shop Akari. There are two ways to charge your Solamonkey. You can place the unit in direct sunlight with the solar panels perpendicular to the sun. 12 hours of strong sunlight will charge the internal battery fully. or You can attach the USB / DC charging cable into any 5V USB output socket (e.g. on your computer), plugging the DC (round) end into the DC input socket located next to the 5V USB socket at the bottom of the solarmonkey adventurer. Whilst the unit is charging, the LED will show RED. Once the unit is charged, the LED will show GREEN. However, if you need the Powertraveller universal travel cord for wall charging (sold separately from the Solamonkey), we offer it at $14.40 each. This universal travel cord works in over 150 counties around the world and has 4 different interchangeable head plugs you can use depending on what continent you are in, which includes Europe. I hope this answers your question, however feel free to contact me with any other questions you may have. Thank you! Lulu Shop Akari 713-869-4656"
"I am wonderign what is the difference with the ""extrme"" version?",Do not have anything to compare it to. I like the Powertraveller it is very robust and performs as described.
will it charge iPhone 6 ?,Yes
"Is this solar charger the best option for backcountry travel for weeks at a time or is there anything lighter, more durable and/or more effective?","The solar charger is very durable and extremely light. It's great for short hikes not lasting more than 5 days. I have had some issues with the charger not charging an iPhone 5 with just solar power, but charging the internal battery first usually charges any phone. I only say it's good for 5 days because I haven't tried the charger for any longer of a period. It's great to clip on a pack as you travel so the internal battery gets charged and very user friendly. It is definitely great for charging phones or a small gps. Anything bigger you would have to get a charger with better output. If you are looking for an even more rugged product look at the Joos solar charger."
Will it charge an iphone 5?,"Yes is it - I believe it will charge an iphone twice while the device is fully charged.. If you go to the main webiste of the manufacturer - you will see what each device is capable of charging, charging times, etc. Good luck"
Does this package contain Windows 7 OS installation disk please?,Windows 7 came pre-installed. No OS disk was provided. The only option is to make a recovery disk.

is that an express card reader? above theother card slot?,This model comes with a one slot ExpressCard/34.
Does it have HDMI port?,There is not HDMI port built-in to the T530.
Which one of the swivel touch screen models has HDMI port?,"None that I'm aware of. They do, however, have a DisplayPort, which operates identically (same with DVI). You'll need to purchase a DisplayPort to HDMI dongle (this is the one you want: http://www.amazon.com/Startech-DP2HDMI-DisplayPort-Adapter-Converter/dp/B0017K6BDW/ref=sr_1_1?rps=1&ie=UTF8&qid=1414541986&sr=8-1&keywords=displayport+to+hdmi). These work flawlessly and are active, not passive. They support full 1920 1080p resolution."
can it use the finger as a pen to write on the screen&#xFF1F;,"Yes, although it's not going to be as precise as the pen would be though. I always seem to have a problem at work because people go to point at something on the screen and instead they move everything around."
What is the battery life on this laptop? How many hours between charges?,"The battery life when in power saver mode will usually last 5 or 6 hours if it is constantly used. The recharge time is typically 1-2 hours, but we are using the car adapter chargers by PWR+, which could increase or decrease regular charge times."
"before I order I would like to know if the touchpad is the three button type, not the single pad type that everyone hates. Thanks",Yes it is the 3 button type with touchpad I can email you a picture if you like.

Does this laptop have the illuminated keyboard?,Nope.
"does this one have any different as 24382LU, except CPU?",Sorry.i have no idea about this.i bought it for my friend.
Hooked up and getting muted sound. My old standard Sony turntable packed a much louder punch from reciver. Is this a arm weight issue? Cables?,Most likely the hook up is a balance issue . You tube has some very good how to videos that explain the balance arm . The muted sound is most likely because your receiver doesn't have a dedicated phono amp . Your old Sony turntable probably had the phono amp built in . Pro-Ject sells one for about $150.00 but you can find them for less . I had the same issue as you with the muting and was reluctant to add to the cost of an already expensive turntable but the investment is worth it .
Can I use this player in Japan in good condition?,I don't see why not. The Pro-Ject Debut Carbon allows you to use it in countries that run on 110/120 or 230/240 Volt - 50 or 60 Hz
"I have bumped the cartridge a few times dropping the stylus hard on the LP or on the platter, will this hurt my stylus? How do you clean it?","I have not noticed any damage from dropping the stylus, however, as I'm sure you're aware, that's probably not a good habbit to form. As far as cleaning, there are multiple products available that I'm sure would work great, but I personally use a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser. It's definitely worth doing your own research, and it's totally understandable if you want to stay away from a semi-DIY approach, but after cleaning my stylus hundreds of times I can say that I'm happy with the results. If the record itself is clean you should be able to notice an audible difference. Hope this helps."
"Love the looks and price but need to ask, how do you switch from 33-1/3 to 45, and where is the 45 adapter housed when not in use?","I liked the look of the unit as well, the paint is the ONLY thing going for it. It weighs about one pound, the dust cover is paper thin, the platter pad is so thin you won't believe it. The speed is changed by pulling the platter, but the thing you need to know is the Debut Carbon table hums, and you can't get rid of the hum. Look it up on Google, put in Debut Carbon Hum problem, and believe me, no matter what you read, you CAN'T get rid of the hum, FORGET THIS TURNTABLE, OR IF YOU MUST TRY IT, BUT NOTHING BUT THE DC MOTOR VERSION, DO NOT BUY THE STANDARD AC MOTOR VERSION, UNLESS YOU JUST ENJOY HEARING HUM."
I have a vintage onkyo A-7 amp and it has a phono input.Will i need a preamp for this turntable?Im not familiar with a moving magnet cartridge.,As long as you have a phono input; you do not need a preamp.
Is there automatic pick-up at the end of a record?,"No, there is not."
"Worked for 2 months then I didn't play it for awhile and when I turned it on I get loud ""buzz"" and it only plays through one speaker. What's wrong?","There could be something wrong with your receiver. What kind do you have? Do other inputs play through both speakers just fine? In order to diagnose it, try hooking up the turntable to a different receiver to see if that works. Something also could have come loose--either the grounding wire, or the plugs themselves."
any pre amp suggestions for receivers that dose not have any phono input?,The Bellari VP130 Tube preamp is what I use. Sounds fantastic along with the Debut.
"should i get a different pre amp, i have a denon receiver and does not have a phono input to enjoy this one out of the box?","I have a denon myself.. If you have an aux switch you may be able to use your receiver.., If not get a pre amp.. This turn table is awesome.. i highly recommend it.. Best value out there.."
what are the dimensions?,415 x 118 x 320mm (WxHxD) lid closed
The controls works in iPhone / iPad,yes they do!
How long are these cables?,"the total length is 52 inches. But, beware! you cannot control volume with there cables! would advise going to SOL's web site and ordering the OEM!"
Does this work with track hd?,Yes. I have the HD also and I can't tell the difference.
This cable allows you to adjust the volume?,"Sorry, but no. It only plays and pauses. Also, it doesn't work with Android."
do all of the buttons work with android?,"yes, I can pause/resume/skip music and answer/hang-up calls on my Optimus."
Is it labeled by lenovo and covered by existing lenovo pc warranty or is this an after market compatible brand?,Genuine Lenovo.
Is this memory labeled by lenovo and covered by lenovo pc warranty or is this a compatible after market brand?,"It is not marked as Lenovo, it is compatible and working just fine."
Does this memory stick fit the Thinkpad x131e AMD?,"I have an intel version, so I do not know. But I found the correct part number on the Lenovo web site when you give it your specific model number"
Will this memory fit my Lenovo X230 ThinkPad?,Go to Lenovo website to confirm. Off the top of my head I would say NO but might be incorrect.
Is this an actual Lenovo brand memory or a comparable or compatible model?,I honestly can't remember the name on them and I have no reason to dismantle my computer and look. The memory works as advertised and did from the time of installation. I am 110% satisfied with the product and service from the seller.
will it fit thinkpad 019-5fu?,"If computer has enough slots for more RAM sticks , and if operating system will recognize increased amount of RAM AND if presently installed RAM is same type (1600 SODIMM) it ought to fit. Go to Crucial.com and opt for their free program to scan computer and make recommendation of amount and type of RAM needed."
IS it suitable to be installed on T430?,Yes.
Will this work with a Lenovo ThinkPad X230 Tablet?,"I'm not sure. I bought a Lenovo ThinkPad Edge 68852BU 15.6"" Notebook and it worked just fine with that."
"Is this compatible with all-in-one desktops, like HP Pavilion series?","It could be, provided the all-in-one uses laptop style memory - some do, some don't. BTW the picture doesn't match the product. Since this was made for a specific system it won't be ""officially supported"" even if it works."
Does this lens addition produce any vignetting?,Yes at times a significant amount. However if you're using a dslr with a lot of megapixels ie d3200 cropping out the dark spots may work for you.
I bought this product but I think I need and adapter ring to be able to connect it to my D50 camera . . .do you know which one I need?,"hi, i think that your Nikon D50 DSLR have a 52 mm lense size for their 18-55 original lense, therefore should not require an adapter ring for your .43 wide angle lens. however if you have another kind of lense on your DSLR ( normal lense, wideangle or telephoto lens for example) you need check the external size of your lense and verify if is a 52 mm ring. in this case you need an adapter ring for this size"
I have D7000 with 10 - 105 mm lens. Can I use this on top of it?,"Yes, I pretty sure You can! I believe it will fit any Nikon lens! It has an Adapter with it!"
"I have a Panasonic FZ150. It takes a 52mm screw on filter, so I'm assuming this should work too. Comments? (I want to use this to take inside pics)","I don't own a Panasonic so I cannot relate concerning its fit. On the other hand, if it works you may notice that it will operate like a wide angle. I had used it with my 18-55mm lens and it seems to make it work like a 16-55mm. However, at its extreme focal distance (wide angle) there is some obvious vignette ( a darkening at each of the 4 corners). it was not too expensive so I am not going to bother to return it. The ""macro-feature"" aspect -when used up close to an object the lens behaves a bit like a magnifying glass. It is Ok, but not great as a macro lens."
How can this fit in my Nikon D7100 DSLR??,"You just have to fix it to your camera lens, as in a 18.55 or the zoom lens, which ever you are planning to use. It will give you the benefit of using your zoom along with the wide angle. This is an adapter only so it has to used with your camera lens. Just screw it onto the lens and start shooting.."
My Nikon slrd d7100 seems NOT to fit this product I just purchased... do I miss something??,delete Tom from your files as he passed away in December 2013.
what quality macro photos can be taken,The quality is good. Used it for landscapes in ireland. The problem was if the light is hitting it a certain way sometimes you got shadows and a sort of a dark framing around the picture.
"I know it says it does, but so does alot and they dont. Does it really fit for a tf300t","Yes, it will fit. it will protect your unit in-case you drop it, it can happen."
"I have the invisible SHIELD by ZAGG installed on my ASUS TF300 as a screen protector, but will the case interfere or disrupt its position?","No, It will not disrupt anything about it, but the screen will have to be very clean before installation, because you will see dust particles under it. The case is a very good protector in case it fall out of your lap or storage case. It's a good investment."
"Would this work for a Transformer TF310? Button and ports don't have to align perfectly, just enough that they're still relatively useable.",Don't know what the measurement of the TF310 is. Best to email the seller. They are fast to respond and easy to deal with.
Will this fit the Asus Transformer Pad Model TF103? Not really concerned if all the ports line up but would like speaker to not be muffled.,It fit mine and all the ports as well.
Will this case fit the TF700T,No there is a different model for the TF700T
Does this case truly make it easy to use the keyboard dock with it?,I don't know but I did not like this case. It fits loosly and smells like rubber. I am not using this case any longer.
Will this case also fit the T100T Tablet? If not do you have a model that does?,"I believe so. My kids have the T100's. You can confirm the dimensions by going to the ASUS website, but I believe they are the same size."
does it come with screen protector?,Nope.
Does this case include a screen protector?,nope
Will my keyboard docking station attach with the case in place?,"I don't have a keyboard dock for my tablet, but I would have to say no. The case is really thick and adds great protection if dropped, but the answer is no."
Does the remote control work when the Roku is mounted out of direct line-of-sight?,Oh yes. It most certainly does. I'm very pleased with it.
will this work on an older analog tv? i have my Roku2 XS connected via composite wires in the bedroom. Just curious.,"Yes, just go to any hardware store and purchase a wide piece of velcro and attach a piece to the Roku and another piece to the television. It will hold the mounting bracket in place . Rick"
Does this mount work with Roku 3 when using Ethernet Cables?,Yes it can
Does this work on the newer set or roku devices? Roku 1 2 or 3?,I have a 3 and it works great!
Will this attach to a VESA mounting hole if the TV is free standing?,"yes. in my case, since my tv's mount hole is wider than the back hole of the roku's, i did a little ""editing"" to the roku's; worked just fine. i just had to make sure the bolt head entered completely into the frontal hole otherwise the roku fit very awkwardly into the mount. if too much trouble, & are not moving the roku, u can also use a piece of strong mounting tape & put it anywhere you want....hope this helps. ;)"
xs,I don't know what that means. Might be a verson like roku 3.
Does this work with Roku 2500X model and A Sharp LCD TV?,I tried to use it with LG 47LN5400 and it would not work because the vents were recessed and not on the sutface.
How does the remote still work?,"It still works, as the remote uses Bluetooth (in the Roku 2) or WiFI (Roku 3) to connect to the box, it has no line of sight requirement unlike a IR remote."
will it work with roku 2,Yes...I have the Roku2 XD...they are the same size...but ill tell you this...a piece of velcro will do just fine. One strip on the Roku and one on a flat clean surface on the back of your TV abd you saved some money....just a suggestion..(it works!) Velcro is like a buck at Walmart or Michaels...hope this helped!
"Does this TotalMount - ROKU UNIVERSAL MOUNTING KIT work for Vizio 32"" E320VP TrueFlat HDTVs? My model doesn't have any vents in the rear, but it does have four mounting holes.",Yes. There are plastic clips that hook into the vents on the back of the TV. It comes with four different clips that you can change depending on what direction your vents go. It also comes with mounting screws if ypu decide to mount onto walls or furniture. We have a Sharp Aquos and it was fine with it. I don't think you will be unhappy with the purchase.
I'm debating between this lens and the Nikon 24-120mm f/4 G for a Nikon D610 body. Is the 24-120 going to be considerably sharper?,"go to nikonusa.com.. look at lenses you have the ability to check a box and compare lenes, side by side.. i love my 24-85..."
Would you use this lens for portraiture? Is it as good as the 85mm fixed lens?,"It's OK, but you are looking at f4.5 rather than 1.4 or 1.8 with a prime. Plus, you get a sharper image with a prime. If you are a pro, stick with the prime. You will probably get fewer keepers on a camera like a D800 if you are looking for details. For casual its fine."
which lens is better for image quality on digital nikon DX camera Nikon 24-85 FX or 16- 85 DX,"The 24-85 is an excellent lens that I use on my D700. However for a DX camera the 18-55mm VR is an excellent optical performer,lighter and costs less. It will also provide you with a wider angle than the 24-85. Keep in mind that the 24-85 on a DX will have the focal equivalent of 36-127mm."
Will this lens work with an Nikon D2xs camera?,"Yes. It works with all Nikon DSLRs whether DX or FX. The combination of the 24-85mm with the Nikon D2X, a DX camera, should produce excellent results due to the smaller size of the image sensor, which is not as demanding as larger FX image sensors."
Will this work with Nikon D5000?,"Yes. But be aware that on the D5000, this lens behaves as a 36-127.5mm due to the 1.5X crop factor."
can you take macro pictures with this 24-85mm-3-5-4-5,"although this lens is not a true macro lens, you can get pretty close.. the closest you can get & focus {at any mm with this lens} is around 8"" to 10"" then you could crop it in an editing program!!"
Where is this lens made?,This lens is made in China.
IS THIS LENS CAN USE IT TO TAKE MACRO PICTURES,This is a very good lens but not ideal for macro photography.
Will this lens would work better for indoor sports under not so great lighting than a 55-200 VR 4-5.6 on a D3100?,"I used the 55-200mm/4-5.6 lens on my DX format D200 and thought that it was an excellent lens. There are two things that would make me prefer it to the excellent 24-85mm/3.5-5.6 in your case. First, you would probably be using the lens at longer focal lengths, in which case both lenses would be operating at f/4.5 to f/5.6, so there is no advantage to having the 24-85mm in terms of low light capability. Second, the 24-85mm is designed for the FX format, so you'd be paying for a wider field lens than you need on a DX camera. If you ever go to FX format, the 24-85mm/3.5-5.6 is a real jewel to own."
is there a warranty from Nikon?,"On Nikon's website it says: Nikkor lenses come with a standard one year warranty and Nikon Inc. lenses sold by authorized Nikon Inc. dealers will have a Nikon Inc. Five Year Extension. To register for the five year extension, one copy of the included form must be mailed in as indicated. Keep the Customer copy of the form as well as the original proof of purchase (sales receipt)."
Is this the only lens I'll ever need?,"Probably so. Its range is enormous and its clarity is stunning. I've parked the two lesser lenses I used previously and am using only this lens. It is a bit heavy, but you get accustomed to it quickly. Given the great shots I've taken with this lens, it's the only lens I will use. In fact, it's the only lens I'm taking on a month long trip to Africa this year."
Has anyone used this lens with a Nikon D80? How did it do?,"I used this lens on my D7000 and my D80 before returning the lens because it was just a little too big and ungainly for mine or my wife's comfort, especially with respect to the smaller/lighter D80 body on which it was a bit front heavy. It performed admirably for shooting outdoor sports on each body at it's not like the lens was ridiculously big, but was quite a bit larger than our beloved 18-200 to the point of not being nearly as pleasant to work with. Tended to want the monopod to keep from getting fatigued doing extended shoots, whereas the 18-200 was fine handheld."
will this work with my D-200?,"Yes, it will work well with your D200. The downside to the lens is its weight, it's a very heavy lens, best used with a tripod. With such a wide range, it's tempting to use it as an everyday lens, but the weight limits its usefulness"
"Comparing the Nikon 18-300mm lens to the Tamron 16-300mm, has anyone compared the two? The price difference is over $300.00",I love the Nikon Lens. I've learned that Nikon makes the glass for all of there lenses. The Nikon is a better lens in my opinion and you get what you pay for. You definitly should buy a UV filter to protect all of your lenses.
"I have a question: can you post the United Kingdom. If so, how much is it and how long does it take to receive it?",Yes if you use myus.com that is to say purchase it in the US and have it mailed to your Myus.com address who will forward it to the UK - check their website
18-200mm vs 18-300mm - which one would you suggest?,"I own both. But if you only want one, well, a. if you value light-weight, smaller size, easier to lug around, then get the 18-200 b. if you really really want the extra zoom, and don't mind the extra mass, get the 18-300 I wanted both worlds...but I will tell you, my hand did get tired more quickly with the 18-300 mounted...and after I saw the difference in the full zoom pics, I thought to myself : ""Is that all the extra I get?""....which I did want more zoom, and I am happy, but thought it would be much bigger than actual results... Holding/shooting with one hand, the 200 felt like a pleasure...the 300 felt hefty. I think hobby-ists can do without the extra zoom...try and find samples of shots at 200mm and 300mm zooms, and decide if it makes a difference to you..."
will this work with my D-60?,"Hi Deborah...the Nikon lenses work on everything from the D50 to the newer cameras. I bought it to use for a D90. It will definitely fit the D60. I love the lens. Note it is much heavier to steady and carry than other lenses, but the picture quality is much better and it is nice not to have to carry a lot of extra lenses since this zooms out so far. As soon as we can afford it again, we are buying a second one for my husband's D7000."
compare 18-300 vs 28-300,"From what I see on Nikon's website, the 28-300 is a FX lens while the 18-300 is a DX lens. If you have a FX (full frame size sensor like D3, D600, D800) camera, you should buy the 28-300. You'd have to use the camera in crop mode if you mounted the 18-300. If you have a DX camera (D3100, D5200, D7100), you should buy the 18-300."
What is the difference with this lens (AF-S DX NIKKOR 18-300mm f/3.5-5.6G ED VR) and the AF-S DX NIKKOR 18-300mm f/3.5-6.3G ED VR ?,"Hi, Here is a good review from Ken Rockwell. This Nikon 18-300mm VR is a smaller, lighter version of the original 18-300mm VR. The original 18-300 was very good, so good in fact that I sold an image I made with it to McDonald's - and they are using it on a billboard. This new lens is as good, and is smaller, lighter and less expensive, so it's even better! My only real complaint about the original 18-300 was that it weighed a lot more than my camera, and this new 18-300 weighs ten ounces less! This new 18-300mm also offers Vibration Reduction (4 stops) and instant manual-focus override. It's very slightly slower at the 300mm end (f/6.3 versus f/5.6) than the older lens, and for ten ounces off my shoulder, that's nothing. By taking off 10 ounces, I now can carry this new lens everywhere I never bothered with the old 18-300. This new lens do everything, and it even does macro. At 300mm, it focuses to within just inches of the front of the lens."
what does it weigh ?,"Just at 2 pounds. It seems heavy, but it certainly is worth carrying the weight around!"
does it have a sim slot?,No
"Can this be used with the keyboard? I originally bought the S2110+keyboard, but the tablet has been damaged, keyboard ok.","sorry, I don't understand the question. Do you mean if you bought another 2110? Then the answer is yes. On the other hand, if you decide to buy a different computing device then I would be interested in buying the keyboard from you."
does this tablet have gps,I dnt remenber cause it doesnt work
this tablet can use micro sd? thank you,It has an SD card with it.
can the sim card work in countries outside USA such as Egypt ?,TAB3AN YA MADAM. IT WILL WORK
I havew seen answers in this forum that say that this tab either has or has not a SIM card slort. Does it or does it not have one?,Does not have SIM card slot
can use sim card n this tablet in india,no
Can I write a paper on this?...word prcessing,I don't know why not. You have a keyboard. It's basically just a small laptop.
Is this an unlocked tablet? Can we use any SIM card? Please help me with this question,"I have heard that a sim card can be used, I personally haven't tried but there is a tiny slot for it. Micro-HDMI, Micro-USB, SIM card slot."
I have bought this tablet how do I insert the sim card,I do not have this tablet any more.
Would you please compare nook to kindle fire?,"They both have good price points, decent interaction and speed, but both lack SD Card Slots and try to lock the system down to keep people on their respective vendor's content. Both are built on Android, but it is quite buried and not readily accessible. You would need to probably void the warranty to get to the base Android system. Here is a good side by side I found compare: http://www.gizmag.com/kindle-fire-hd-vs-nook-hd/24959/ If you already purchase music, books, movies, etc from one or the other, then I would go with that one. But if you want more freedom and long term customization, go with something that is base Android like the Lenovo S2110 or Asus Transformer Prime. Or if your on a budget, checkout the Nexus 7/10 or the Galaxy 7"" If you want to get to know them in person, run down to BestBuy, Staples, Wal-mart or any store with electronics and they should have a display with each of the devices where you can get to know them. Cheers -IT Ninja"
Is there a case that holds the tablet and the keyboard?,It only holds the tablet it self !
only black or is any other colour available,"Mine is black, and when I bought mine, I did not see any other colors available."
IS THE SYSTEM UPGRADABLE,"If you mean can the Android version be upgraded - yes. But most makers are not in a hurry to upgrade their products, so in many cases you should not count on an upgrade to a later version. Google releases version updates on a regular basis but the maker has to take the Android release and adapt it to fit the device. And most of them do not."
Does it have a front and rear camera? And does it come with the keyboard or do I have to purchase that separately?,"It has cameras on both sides, and my tab came with the keyboard. Amazon also sells (or used to sell when I bought this) another model which is exactly the same but without the keyboard."
can it use simcard apart from wifi connection? i am about pacing order and will need an urgent reply from you please.,"NO, it does not have any phone hardware. WiFi only."
this tablet can use micro sd? thank you,The keyboard dock takes a full size SD card. You can get a SD card adapter that will take a micro SD card.
this tablet has HDMI. How can I connect to TV?,Get a micro HDMI to full size HDMI cable and connect the tablet and your TV. Or get a micro HDMI adapter for a full size HDMI cable.
"Does this tablet has GPS function, if I want to use it in my car. How does the navigation works?","I'm sorry, but this tablet does not have GPS hardware."
How is it for watching Netflix?,I just got a S2110 yesterday and am very impressed with it. I don't use Netflix but the Google Play Store has it for download and the Store says that the S2110 is compatible with Netflix.
I need an analog radio that can be controlled using an on/off timer. Is the power switch a mechanical power so it comes back when power is restored ?,"The answer is yes. There's a master power switch on the back. Just do a Google image search to see for yourself. But, just to clarify your question. You want to leave the radio on and have a timer in the power outlet so that the radio turns on and off according to the timer, right?"
I would like to know on which electricity it run 110 Volts of 220 Volts Appreciate for prompt reply.,"In the 2nd picture that is shown in product description page at Amazon.com of the gabinet back side you can read that receiver uses AC Power of 230V 50Hz, and this is the one I need. Is that right? If I buy it I'll receive with AC Power of 230V 50Hz?"
"What is the watt of this radio 220, 240 etc",This model has Output Power of 3 Watts Left Speaker +3 Watts Right Speaker +10 Watts Subwoofer
Can I use the earphone out as a line out without problems?Otherwise this is a fine radio..John T,No
Are any of you still receiving the faulty units manufactured in 2012?,Mine is working fine.
Do the stations drift at all? I had a smaller new model radio from this brand and I would have to retune in whatever station that I was listen to,No
"amazon picture shows ""mw"" lettering above fm,sangean sight shows ""am"" above fm which is the improved model,thanks,Walt.","My WR-12, purchased on Amazon in September 2014, displays ""AM"". No problems with it, at all, just great audio and visual aesthetics."
Are these radios the newer ones that the tuning and sound problems are resolved?,"Hi Roy, No I had the older version."
does it come with the darker wood finish or the lighter one? both are shown in the description.,Mine was lighter wood.
In what country was this radio manufactured?,"I no longer have the original packaging. In looking behind the unit, I found no information on country of manufacture. That kinda surprised me. Sorry."
Do I HAVE to program these to use them or can I just set the channels and talk? Also would this work for 2 cars following each other?,You DON'T have to program them. They'd work well for cars following each other. We got them because I fish just a short distance from our property and my wife can contact me without the need for a cell phone.
Can I buy several sets of two and have them all talk to each other?,"Yes, you can only if the frequency of the items is the same."
Can you buy two sets and use them together and/or can you purchase additional handsets to expand your system?,You can use ad many of them as you need. I have 5 radios and use them to keep in contact with family on camping trip.
"I saw two different answers about needing a license? We are going on a cruise, and wanted to use these...anybody tried it and would we get in trouble","No, you do not need. Do not worry too much."
Having difficulty finding information on car chargers for these radios. Anyone know if car chargers are available?,"YeS...well no, but I use a 12V inverted for a car plug and the original charger... and somehow make them stay in good enough to charge...ubcan figure that out"
What are the appropriate replacement rechargeable batteries for these?,"I just did a web search baofeng 888s battery, same walkie, they are 3.7v, the battery dosnt seem to have a part number on it. Hope that helps"
Can these be programmed for channels 8-14?,"if the two walkie talkie can be paired to the same channel, they will work without any problem."
Are these easy enough for a 5 year old to use?,"Hi Carol, Yes these radios are easy enough for a 5 year old to use. However I would recommend something more durable though. My only concern is that if these were to be dropped, the battery pack will not fit back into the radio. During a test that I performed myself at school, I dropped one from a typical height of about 4 ft. and the battery pack did not fit in properly. The reasoning be that the metal hooks that the pack slides into to hold the battery in place were bent. Then again, for the price, with a few clicks, it can be yours. So yes easy to use, just remind everybody to be gentle. Hope this helps, please don't hesitate to ask if you have more questions!"
my question is are these real wakie talkies are you sure i don't have to program them also do i need a license for these radios,These are two-way radios and do not need to be programmed. You do not need a license to use these in the U.S.
What are the demensions of this clock/radio?,"Approximately 5 and a half inches tall and 5 and a half inches wide, by 3 and a half inches deep. It is not a perfect cube shape, so those are the longest measurements. The clock dial is about 3 and a half inches in diameter."
Is there a weekday/weekend setting for the alarm?,"Yes, there are two alarms; you can set them any way you like--weekday, weekend, daily, once."
Does this radio display song title and artist information? I think that's what RDS means but description doesn't say. Thx.,"RDS stands for Radio Data system - Displays - Station Name, Programme Type, Radio Text (New item, etc), Year/Day, Date/Day, Time, Frequency. Clock stopped working after a couple of weeks and there is no way to manually set it. Now only the radio works. Need to get a special adaptor if using in Australia. Not very impressed."
What color is the backlight?,White with a slightly bluish tint.
Powered by batteries?,"There is no battery back-up. There is a large capacitor inside the unit, which will provide enough energy to get past short power glitches. The unit does not plug directly into the wall. It has a 'wall-wart', which supplies six volts unregulated, unfiltered DC to the unit. You could easily make a battery back-up, which would plug into the unit in place of the wall-wart as an extended back-up power supply. Here in Florida, the power is subject to recurring interruptions of short duration during summer thunderstorms. The unit has handled these without problems."
does this radio have a headphone jack?,Yes it does have a earbud jack. There is also a AUX jack on the back.
Is there any ticking noise?,No. Works very well.
can I turn the backlight completely off?,"If not, you can dim it very close. Let me check. With the radio off, keep pressing the snooze bar. The display will keep getting brighter, but will shut off. Then it will progress from the dimmer side of the spectrum."
Does the clock auto adjust for daylight saving time changes?,"Yes it does but depending on where you have it, it could take a day or so. Last fall my clock changed immediately to standard time but this spring it didn't change until the next night. It was in the same spot but that also happens with other atomic clocks we have. Sometimes they change immediately, sometimes a day or two later."
"I'm having a hard time getting the Atomic clock to set automatically, specifically the analog clock is stuck on midnight. Any advice?","I wouldn't call it stuck. When you push the proper sequence of buttons to set the Atomic clock, it will go to midnight, and then wait to get the signal from Colorado. So, for whatever reason, it is probably not getting the signal from Colorado. It could be your local weather related or a unit malfunction. To confirm it is not really stuck, try to set the time using RBDS. That should work if you have proximity to an FM station with that service. If the clock is not stuck, I would then try the following. Unplug it for a few hours. In effect this is a reset. There is also a reset button on the bottom - it will do the same thing. Then when you are ready to start again, bring the unit to the highest point in your house facing Colorado. See if it will update. My unit is working right now, so it is not the signal from Colorado that is the problem. The clock could be malfunctining. I had another Sangean Atomic clock radio that had to be returned. But try unplugging it first."
is this tablet really as clumsy as all the reviewers say? or is it manageable?,NO....i do not feel it is. i have lugged around 15 inch laptop which is heavier and with top and bottom pieces much more bulky. i put the plastic film to protect it. have a small 14 or so inch carry bag until i can find the leather holder/stand. i would never trade it for any apple products. might buy one if they ever got big enough. it runs on ice cream sandwich.. but i am sure it will eventually be upgraded.
How does the screen resolution/clarity compare to the iPad Retina?,"It is not as good as the iPad. The resolution is 900x1600 pixels, the ipad is 2048x1536. Having said that is it still very usable and 13 inch is a nice size."
is it good for small video editing,"Sorry, I don't know. I exclusively use it for sheet music/charts."
"Sorry , in addition to previous question about warranty is purchasing the square trade warranty advisable?","Not a problem. Well, here's my honest answer. I have a ""square trade"" warranty on my cell phone and on my tablet. My wife recently used her square trade warranty for her cellphone and the company was fast, reliable and friendly. Since everything (now a days) is so mobile, I feel secure in knowing that I'm covered. I think my policy covered up to $700 (I'd have to look it up). Personally, I find that's very reasonable. Also, I use a free app for saving files, ""drop box"". I installed it on my tablet. Please let me know if this was helpful. If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. Enjoy the weekend. By the way, I love my tablet!"
does it work well with a stylus,Yes
Does this have the jelly bean operating system in it?,no it uses the ice cream sandwich....but like most android products it will eventually upgrade to jelly bean etc. just some companies are slower than others in getting changes out.
can the pictures on this be transfered to computer??,"If you can get the thing to work, then yes, the videos and stills should be in a standard format. However, as noted in my review I found the thing to be a non-working, poorly made, piece of junk; not worth the clam shell package it came in."
How is this thing supposed to work without a USB cable to attach it to the computer to charge this camera and transfer it to my computer?,First off this camera when it comes to the batteries once there dead they dead they it does not recharge using the computer. Second If you are looking at the back of the camera and see a silver button on the right hand side with the word open on it. pull it down. It will eject the usb plug you plug into the computer. Make sure the camera is on first before you lug it in then go to your pictures file. you will see DMC click on that then click on next thing and now you should see the pictures on your computer.
Is it good quality video and audio?,"well audio could be better, but i think the video is great. :)"
Will this lens fit a Sony A 390? how does it compare to the Sony lens which is ~$600?,"Yes, this may fit, as the conector is the same for my A65, where I am using it. I never tried the Sony similar model, but the image quality, quietness and AF speed is amazing. I would recomend this one."
sigma have two 18-250 a mount lenses which one is the newest??,"The one that includes ""Macro"" in the name is the newest version: ""Sigma 18-250mm f/3.5-6.3 DC Macro OS HSM"". It is smaller, lighter, and has improved close-up capability; hence the inclusion of the ""Macro"" monniker. The older lens is still available on Amazon for $329 versus $399 for the new one. Hope this helps!"
Does this lens come with a lens hood?,Yes
sigma versus Tamron as for as quality photos 18-200 or 18-250,"Although I have both Tamron and Sigma lenses, I prefer using Sigma. Better clarity, better constructed."
"I am new to sony , just got a6000, will this work? thanks for any help.","I would say NO! Read the following http://www.sony.net/Products/di/en-us/products/lenses/basics/lensmount.html , The contacts are in different locations , although it will probably mount on the camera."
"Are batteries required? Amazon description states two are needed. 'Batteries 2 AA batteries required.' I know lenses don't need, but just wanted to make sure.","No way, no batteries needed for lens. Your camera, of course, still requires batteries."
Sigma website mentions that the Sony version of this lens does not have OS feature. Is it true? Does that affect the performance?,"I have a Canon. Not sure about Sony. Most Sony DSLRs have ""in body"" stabilization therefore no need to have it in the lens I guess. Mine has stabilization built in the lens."
Does this lens carry a USA warranty?,"Yes if purchased through a legitimate USA dealer like Amazon, I'm sure there are grey market sources out there with a better price, but you won't receive a USA warranty."
does it fit Sony SLT-A77 24.3 MP Digital SLR?,This lens is available with a Sony mount. It can only be used on a APS-C sensor camera (the A-77 has an APS-c sensor)
Are the pictures crisp on a Sony camera? Any issues with soft focus?,"I really dont have an answer for you on a Sony, I shoot a Nikon 7100 and it works great with my camera. Good knock around lens that takes great photos.."
Is there such a sigma lens that is auto/manual for pentax mount with this zoom?,Don't quite understand the question but I have the Pentax version of this lens and it can operate in manual or auto focus. Just flip a switch.
Does this lens come with a lens hood?,Yes. A pretty good one.
Is this lens warranty valid by buying through Amazon?,Sure. Amazon is an authorized seller for pretty much any major photography brand.
"Some of you experienced a rather stiff zoom ring with a ""bump"" around 100mm. Does that go away over time or did you exchange for a better one?","I've never noticed a ""bump"". If it did exist, it disappeared quickly. The zoom is a bit stiff, but I like that and experience no ""creep"" that bothers some other zoom lenses. I've had the lens since New Years, and I'm very pleased with it."
The listing for this says it requires 2 AA batteries. Is this correct?,No it does not.
Can you 'fine adjust' the focus manually when the lens is in 'auto' mode? Some lenses allow you to do that without having to switch to manual mode.,"No you have to be in manual mode on this one, but it works great when you do...I just switch back to Auto when I am done (I usually stay on automatic 95% of the time and only use manual every once in a while)"
"Will this lens work on the Pentax k-x? If so, will I experience any drawbacks or incompatibility?",Yes this will work with the Pentax K-x. All the latest Pentax DSLR (except the 645D and Q series) use the same mount. So it will fit and function as it should (as well as Sigma programming allows). You may not have some of the exif info that you would have used a Pentax made lens but beyond that you shouldn't have any problems.
Does this lens come with a lens hood?,"If you buy it new, it should come with a lens hood. Mine did."
Why on earth does it say 2 AA batteries required in the product details???? Does it come with a lens hood?,"Haha, that's crazy. No batteries that I could locate; been using it for several months now. And yep it sure does."
Is this lense compatible with the Pentax K5iis?,"I use Canon and I didn't find marvelous this lens, just convenient because of the range. Even if it works on that Pentax, I guess your criterion could be sharpness instead of range, and I think the 18-135 WR is a bit sharper than this one, in case you are chasing for a zoom lens."
What is the view angle? Thank you,It is variable by adjusting a screw on the back. It goes from 3.0mm -12.0mm
"Can this camera be manually adjusted: left to right, up &amp; down to get the optimum view?",Yes
"just recieved my swpro-780 everything is black and white, no color,???","Try a different input on ur DVR that you know works correctly. If it still does not show color, u have a defective unit as the night/low light feature is automatic. These cameras are built very well and I have had no problems so far."
will it work on swann 960,"If your refering to a ""DVR8-3200 8 Channel 960H Digital Video Recorder"" Then yes I don't see a reason why it wouldn't work just fine."
Can I connect this camera to my DirectTv Dvr?,"I don't have a DirectTV DVR so I don't know. However, the camera has a BNC connector that is convertible to a RCA connector. A power supply that comes with the camera."
do I need to buy the wires to install it&Eacute;,"No, this comes with 60ft of wire."
comes with wires,Yes 50 feet RCA wire.
will the camera hookup to a dvr8-1450 ?,The best way is to contact Swann directly
how long are the cables with this SWPro- 780 camera. I wish to order today.,I'm not sure. I ordered extra cable to be sure I had enough and didnt install it myself
the camera says optical zoom....how can you zoom ? I have tru-blue dvr but cannot find a way to zoom..!,I believe you can only zoom by turning a screw on the back of the camera.
will this auto focus using my Nikon D5200 or do I have to manually focus the lens.,"If you get the Nikon version, it will autofocus on your D5200."
What are all the differences between this lens and the Sigma 18-250 DC OS II lens?,"I'm guessing you meant the 18-200 DC OS II? I don't think a 18-250 DC OS II exists yet. The main differences are longer zoom in the 250, while the 200 uses a new lens layout and materials. Overall quality is negligible and the extra cost is all about whether or not that extra 50mm is worth it to you."
Does this lens have optical stabilization?,Yes it does have an optical stabilizer that can be switched on or off.
What is tha difference between the MACRO and NON-MACRO version of this lens?,"The non-macro version is the older model of this lens and uses 72mm filters. The macro version is the new and improved version, uses 62mm filters and is manufactured somewhat differently. I believe the new macro version is supposed to be a bit smaller overall and lighter than the older version."
does it go on Nikon d5000?,The Sigma 18-250mm is born to go with the Nikon d5000. It should work on all the Nikon DX models.
What's in a box? Is there hood?,Yes you get a hood included.
Is this lens compatible with the Nikon D3000?,It fits all the Nikon DSLRs
does this lens fits NIKON D50???,I have a Nikon D3100; I checked the compatibility chart on the Sigma site @ Sigmaphoto.com. Your D50 camera is also listed. I'm very happy with lens.
Does this lens work with Nikon D70?,This lens is excellent for the D70.
Does this lens work in a nikon d200?,"Yes, just make sure to buy the Nikon lens mount. You won't regret buying this lens, very versitile, amazing photos and a great price too."
"What is the actual view angle in degrees. There is not one description in any of the cams that I research that gives a better description of the view angle besides ""wide angle"". WHAT is the view angle?",www.swann.com/s/products/view/?product=1366 - It states 75 degree viewing angle
Not sure what dvr is -- i don't think I have it. Where else or what else can I connect this to? Thanks,Connect to any video in on Tv or monitor
Do any of the Swann Security Cameras have built-in audio?,This one does not. Great picture but no sound. You would have to get a separate mic to go with it which they make.
I purchased a PRO 760 camera in November and it worked great until last night. Woke up to a white screen. Suggestions? Thanks Craig,The first suggestion is to check the wiring. I had similar problems and took the camera down and connected it to DVD and everything worked. I then replaced the entire lenght of wire and the camera is still working.
Can this camera be manually adjusted side to side?,"Yes. Up down, side to side can be adj to your need."
How wide angle of view is this camera? Thanks,90 degrees
"can this camera be used where we got another bullet install, would it be easy to install same bullet type","Different sizes of bullet camera's available larger and smaller. Mounting will be a little different pattern. video plugins will be the same. You can mount in same place, but might have to drill one or two holes."
will this work with dvr8-1500h,yes
How is the viewing inside of a garage monted in corner about 8 feet high?,It would be good but a 2.8mm lens camera would give you an even wider view.
can I connect the 760 a router?,My normal cameras are 720 and this one was added to the mix. So the box must adjust automaticly. The detail is twice as good as the standard camera.
Online I see this lens as part #880-101 and part #883-101. Does anyone know the difference?,"It looks like the ""#883-101"" is a newer version for the same model. You may not be able to buy ""#880-101"". I did a comparison of these two versions and here are differences [values for #883-101], (values for #880-101): 1. Angle View: [69.3 - 5.7], (76.5 - 6.5) 2. Minimum Focus Distance: [13.8"" (35.05 cm)], (1.48' (45 cm)) 3. Elements/Groups: [13/16], (18/14) 4. Filter Thread: [62 mm], (72 mm) 5. Dimensions (DxL): [Approx. 2.9x3.5"" (7.37x8.89 cm)], (Approx. 3.1x4.0"" (7.87x10.16 cm)) 6. Weight: [1.04 lb. (470g)], (1.39 lb. (630g)) - Most of other features are the same. I hope this will be helpful."
does the zoom lock at any position or only at 18mm? What is the lens length when fully extended to 250mm?,"It only locks at the 18mm. The total length when extended is about 6 1/2 inches, I hope that helps out."
How well does the macro work? Is it true macro or just close focus?,"It works good at a macro but because it is a zoom with AF, it can be difficult to use it as a 'true' macro lens. I prefer to use this for wildlife and landscapes but I have used it for macro. Use the MF if going to use for macro. I hope this makes sense."
"I have ordered this lens, but I wonder if it fits for Canon EOS 450D. There was no mount type info.","Yes it will. And, quite well, I would imagine. Sigma DC lenses are similar to Canon EF-S lenses in that they will only work with APS-C sensor models, such as the Rebel line (also known as EOS xxxD and xxxxD) and 2-digit EOS models like 40D, 50D, and 60D, as well as the single digit 7D. FYI - It will not work with Full-Frame sensor models, such as 6D, 5D, and 1D."
How is it better than Canon 18-50mm and 55-250mm kit lens apart from combining the functionality of both? Is the image quality better?,I do own a 18-50mm on my Rebel.. and this one is for my Nikon... But I really can't distinguish any differences since I am pretty new to the hobby. But I find it very easy now to just have one lens on all the time .. with my canon I would always have to keep changing from my 15-50mm to my zoom lens a lot and it takes too much time plus you have to carry another lens with you. So far so good.. its a really awesome lens.. and all my friends think its cool!
"Is there a lens hood, a UV protector, or a circular polarizer in the box from Amazon.com? Do I need to buy any other accessories in addition to that?",There is a lens hood but no other accessories. You will need to purchase a UV filter.
Is this lens as good as the canon 18-135 stm for doing video on the canon 70D,"I have the Canon 18-135 STM and a different Sigma HSM lens. Canon's STM motor is better for video. You don't hear any focusing noise from the STM motor. Sigma's HSM motor is quiet, but makes light clicking noises as it focuses that were picked up by camera's (EOS 70D) built-in microphone. The clicking wasn't very loud. If there is a good amount of ambient noise, you probably won't notice."
I bought this lens for Canon EOS 6D camera but in viewfinder I see only partial picture. Always see the lens circle around the picture. Can you help,"I believe this is happening because you are using a cropped lens (the Sigma 18-250mm) on a full frame camera (the Canon EOS 6D). Although there are people who do use cropped lenses on full frame cameras (they crop the image using software after it has been taken), you would likely better be served by using a full frame lens on the camera. You can do this by checking which Canon (or aftermarket) lenses are designed for full frame use. Full frame lenses are usually heavier and more expensive, but they are designed for the larger sensor size format of full frame, and often produce more detailed images than their ""cropped"" sensor relatives."
Sigma has two lenses [18-250mm f3.5-f6.3] one is std Telephoto and one is w/MACRO.What is the physical/design difference between them ?,"My advice is to go to DPReview, which is an excellent resource for looking at digital cameras. That is where I get my info. My lens will focus only to ~ 8"", so I'm guessing that the macro lens can get closer. Enjoy - it's an awesome camera!"
"I been told there are 2 different sigma 18-250mm,is this the new model?",There are 2 lenses with similar names. The newest is the 18-250 f 3.5-6.3 DC Macro OS HSM. The older lens does not have the MACRO in the name. The newest lens has better Macro capabilities and is smaller and lighter. I got the newest lens and I love it. See www.dpreview.com for a review of the lenses.
Does this come with a Dual Link DVI cable and the audio cable?,Hi Thank you for your interest. The package includes Dual Link DVI-D cable but audio cable is not included. This monitor doesn't have the speaker. Thank you.
Is this screen Matte or glossy,Hi Thank you for your interest. It's glossy S-IPS panel. Thank you.
What are the dimensions of the box? Would you ship it to a hotel?,Hi Thank you for your interest. Dim : about 72cm x 25cm x 52cm Please let us know your hotel address. We will ask our shipping company. Thank you.
What is the best cable to use to attach this monitor to an iMac?,"The monitor uses DVI input, so you need a DVI cable that can connect to your Mac. I'm not familiar with connecting DVI to Mac, but see cables for that purpose on the web. My Crossover is attached to a Windows computer."
"What's the difference between this monitor and the other Crossover 27"" monitor on here? (""27QD LED BLADE PERFECT PIXEL"")","same thing just a newer model, by the way I love my monitor you'll be amazed with the quality of picture & resolution specially if you edit video or work on pictures"
"Why can't I get 1440P out of this monitor? I have - Drivers updated, computer updated. Compatible card. 25' Dual Link DVI cable.",My video card is NVIDIA GeForce GTX 660 and it gets 2560x1440 pixels. Double check whether you have the right cable.
"Hello, I was wondering besides the max resolution of 2560X1440, does this monitor support lower resolutions such as 1920X1200 or lower?","Sorry, I would not know. The monitor was not compatible with my system so I returned it."
Do these earbuds have real deep bass?,"It is perfect in my opinion. Not to deep, but not weak."
I have the Soul Headphones with an Android and both sides work? Why not the earphones?,"You need to be a little more specific on what's not working? My SL99's worked with my Android phone, as far as playing sound but, the controller did not. That part only works with apple products. I hope this helps?"
Play the next song in the Samsung Galaxy Grand work?,volume buttons and play button are not compatible with Samsung devices
Does the controller work on iPhone 5 or 5S as well?,"I know it works on the iPhone 5, and I am led to believe it also works on the 5S."
Does it work on iPhone5S/5/4S?,I have an iPhone 5 and I've been using it without any problems. Pretty sure it works on the 5S too
It is a orginal Soul headphons?,Yes they originals great price and they sound great
Does the earphone have warranty from SOUL?,I believe so. But you can purchase an extended warranty through Amazon.
Only one earbud works on when I used these earbuds on my Android phone?,"This is an iPhone compatible product, and as such, the side with the remote may not work on an Android. It could also be a faulty product, or perhaps you don't have it plugged in all the way. Just some suggestions."
Does it have volume control?,"Yea, it has volume control. It's basically the iPhone/iPod controls if your're using an iOS device."
How's the bass with these buds and are they durable? Do they fall out the ear easily? Are they sweat proof how do these compare to beats earbuds?,"Bass is great. The overall sound is great actually. As for the ear fit, I find them to be kind of poor in that regard so as for working out I can see many issues unless you had deep ear canals that suited them. The chords are just to heavy for activity. These are best when relaxing."
does it fit with ipad air? and is it the real as they sell at apple store? thanks,No it won't fit the ipad air. You can buy that case from the Apple store.
This Case fits the Ipad 3 ??,The smart cases fit iPad 2-4. It will work fine with yours.
Does it fit the iPad 4,"Yes, it does. I am an user of iPad 4."
Why is shipping weight less than product weight?,Amazon sets that. No idea why it is wrong.
Does it fit the first original IPad,Yes.
Will this case work of the iPad 4th generation?,Yes &#128516;
Does it have all the holes on it to line up with the iPad 3,Yes
Does this case have the apple emblem on the back side of case,Yes.
Is this a Genuine Apple product?,"To my knowledge, mine is."
WILL THIS CASE WORK WITH AN IPAD AIR,I don't think so. Check the description of the product.
would this word with Intel Core i7-4770K Quad-Core?,"No, this is a motherboard for ONLY AMD processors. I did your homework for you, and found a compatible board, good price, and good quality for the Intel i7 4470k Quad-Core. Click the link: http://www.amazon.com/Gigabyte-Intel-6Gbps-Motherboards-GA-Z87-HD3/dp/B00D94X6AK/ref=sr_1_1?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1401129656&sr=1-1&keywords=1150+motherboard+atx"
how is the linux support mint ubuntu gnome steam,Linux will run fine on this board. Ubuntu the same as long as you use the newest version and not LTS. I use steam daily and haven't had an issue at all. Feel free to ask anymore questions.
would an EVGA GeForce GTX 960 GPU be compatible with this board?,Yes
i mainly watch movies and maybe do a little photoshop or video editing with kendenlive(kde video editor) is this more board than i need? i really want,"yes it is overkill but it's a great board. since u are doing video editing u would need a powerful graphics card. i would recommend an asus m5a97 because it has most of the same features as this board and would serve u well. the only real difference is overclocking capability and the ability to have multiple graphics cards which nobody really needsl. if u pair this with a fx 6300, a corsair cx 500 or 600 watt power supply and a rosewill challenger u3 case you would have an excellent gaming/video editing build. gaming and video editing require the same hardware setup for the most part. then just get the best graphics card to suit your needs. also a word of advice DO NOT cheap out on ram. get something from corsair or gskill or another top tier brand. avoid crucial and team. get 1600mhz or 1866 ram it does not cost much more and it's worth it. hope this helps you. good luck"
how fans does it support?,"There are qty 4, 4 pin connectors for case fans, and 2 for cpu. The 4 pin ports are good for 3 pin fans too, just to be clear. This is a great MB for the $, I am completely satisfied.."
Does this support SDRAM kr doe it only support DDR3?,"DDR2 and DDR3 use different memory slots, and this board is for DDR3 only. Chipset also made for DDR3 only"
"Hi, is this motherboard compatible with an AMD FX4300 processor (3.8GHz, 8.0MB Total Cache) ? Thanks.",ASUS Site: https://www.asus.com/Motherboards/M5A99FX_PRO_R20/#specifications
The LED light does not turn on or anything else. The power supply is good because we tested it out. What could be the problem?,Check to make sure your ram and processor are properly seated and make sure polarity isn't wrong on header wires at bottom of board
Does this MoBo have HDMI?,No. Per manufacturer site: Back I/O Ports 1 x PS/2 keyboard (purple) 1 x PS/2 mouse (green) 1 x eSATA 1 x LAN (RJ45) port(s) 2 x USB 3.0 8 x USB 2.0 (one port can be switched to USB BIOS Flashback) 1 x Optical S/PDIF out 6 x Audio jack(s)
Can this board handle overclocking? like OC'ing an fx 8350 and/or GTX 780 SC w/ acx cooling? thanks!,"Yeah, it handles it pretty well. I'm running an FX 8320 at 4.55GHz rock solid. I could go higher, but my Hyper 212 Evo can't handle the heat. As for GPU OCing, that's gonna depend on the GPU, and how much juice your power supply can get to it."
Can I get max resolution (3840x2160) in a 4K monitor with this card?,"I really doubt it. This is a low end card. If you're going for the expense of early adopter 4k, better off shelling out a little more on card that is known to work well in combo w/ the panel you're getting."
I can not get this board to turn on both screens at the same time. Cables r good.monitors r good. running vista.????,"Assuming your setup is supported, display drivers are possible cause. I had some issues that were fixed by removing some drivers via device-manager and then trying some different versions of the nvidia catalyst drivers. I think I mentioned the version that worked for me in my review text. Worth a try."
"What power supply requirements would I be looking at to run a pair of these cards? Assume a standard build with an i5 CPU, Hard Drive, and Optical Drive. No overclocking. Finally, would anyone recommend for me to go with a GeForce GPU for multi-display...","I run two 27"" 2560x1440 display port monitors off of one of these cards with no issues. Max power is 19.5 W. It will work in any system. Works perfectly for business applications, and light computer aided design applications."
I purchased a NVIDIA VNS 310 graphic board for my computer. It did not have the two adapter cords needed to run the card. Were they included?,"No, they have to be ordered separately."
Does it come with a smaller bracket or just the full size?,It does come with the small bracket for small form factor setup.
Does it come with a low-profile bracket?,Yes. It comes with a low-profile and standard height bracket. The only thing this model number doesn't include is the display port to dvi adapters
Will this card work with Intel&reg; Desktop Board DG43GT?,"I did a quick Google search for your Intel Desktop Board DG43GT specifications and your supported video specs indicate your board has a PCI Express x16 add-in graphics card connector which is what this video card uses. Hence, this video card should work with your system. Note the card has two DisplayPort outputs so you may need to purchase adapters to convert DisplayPort output to DVI or VGA depending on your monitor's input requirements. I purchased monitor video adapters from Monoprice. http://downloadmirror.intel.com/17807/eng/DG43GT_TechProdSpec.pdf"
Does the cooling fan very a loud noise? Thanks!,Have never noticed at all. Very small in size and forgot there was one until you posed a question.
Will this install into a Windows XP system?,"NVidia still offers drivers for Windows XP, but the better question to ask is will it work with my motherboard. Reply with your make/model to get the better answer."
"Hi, can someone please help me out? I would like to know if this video card is compatible with the power supply from my Dell optiplex 9020? Thanks.",What is your service tag? I can check.
Is this an actual Apple product? Because I bought this for $49 dollars here &amp; looking at the apple store website the Ipad smart case looks different &amp; cheaper,Yes it is. It has the Apple icon on the back.
Are you sure this fits an ipad 4 with no problems with the cut out fitting properly on the side and back?,"It fits just fine, the only difference is that it has the cut out for the old apple 30-pin connector. You'll have a huge hole for the thunderbolt port, everything else is fine."
Is this a one piece case with the back being polyurethane also,One piece with back. Same material on back as the front cover.
Does it work with iPad with Retina Display?,"Yes, that is what I'm using."
I bought this product and Amazon guarantee in writing that was compatible with IPAD air 2 and it is not so what can we do about it?,"The add only says iPAD, not air 2. I do not have an air 2 and because the add says iPAD, that is why I purchased it."
Is this cover magnetic?,"Yes, it is a magnetic, Smart Cover."
Do these fit the iPad air?,yes. it fits model A1475
Does it fit the new ipad air 2?,I would say no it will not fits iPAD air 2. I have iPad 3 & it works fine. They are different. You can go with your ipad to one of the shops & try if it fit then order it.
Can I use this smart case with the iPad air?,"I'm not sure - but I do know that they are still selling this case for the Ipad Air in the Apple Stores. The one I ordered was for the Ipad 3, which the Apple Stores were no longer stocking."
Does it fit an iPad 2?,"Yes it does, that is what I have."
Does it fit the original iPad 1,No. The iPad 2 and iPad fourth generation are the same dimensions. The 1 is a different size.
Says product dimensions 6x6x6? Surely that's incorrect?,10 x 7 3/4 it's a great product as it automatically turns your pad off & on when you open & close it
Is this truly made by Apple?,"Yes it is. I got the same one in December 2014 , in light blue colour and am very happy with it"
"I want to change my Smart Case for my iPad 4th Gen., should I buy the same smart case again or should I change to a different case/brand?","It sure what a 4th generation iPad is, just purchased an apple case for an iPad 2, and am very happy. If you've had an apple case, you'll be let down by the imposters- trust me I know this from experience. Good luck"
Is this a leather or polyurethane case?,polyurethane
Does this case fit the iPad air 2 ???,does fit nicely on iPad 2 ( the old one) ; i do not think would fit the air one.
Does this protect the back and front?,Yes the ipad snaps into the bottom and top of the cover (top and bottom in one piece) covers the screen firmly when not in use with magnetic hold. All the buttons on the iPad can be used with the cover on. There is no need to ever take it off.
Does this fit In pad Air 1 ?,No
will it fit ipad2 mc774fd/a?,"It fits my air pad 2. It's nice,; after using for some time, would prefer one that is more stable on propping up. Probably where the prop goes to the top-this folds and props at the bottom. I like it, but sometimes it actually falls over if you don't prop it just right!:("
will they work with non-apple devices?,"Yes they will work on non-apple devices, they just aren't as good as I expected. We returned them and bought Bose noise canceling headphones, which are significantly better."
does this work with iPhone 5?,Yes it does work well with Iphone 5
Are they good for working out in?,No. It's too heavy and the ear cups get warm pretty fast when you work out.
does it work well with iPhone 5s,"Yes, great purchase...get rechargeable batteries. I love as I fly a lot and very comfortable."
If I buy them used will they still come with all the accessories including the case?,That is the question - only one whom sells them can answer your question:)
Would it be a bad decision to workout in these?,It would be fine to workout in them as long as it wasn't too intense that they would not stay put. But for most things it would be ok.
can they connect to a google chromebook,They aren't wireless... So idk why they wouldn't. Unless I'm missing something.
Are they wireless?,No they're not
Are they compatible with the Samsung Galaxy S 2?,As far I know they are compatible with all phones... it's a regular 3.5mm cable. I can't see why they wouldn't. But if your phone isn't a 3.5mm output then maybe not.
can you plug it in the aircraft movie chanels,The answer is yes. In fact I got the phones mainly for use in my flying trips to Italy. I am very happy with them and think they deliver the goods! One note: they sound best after a break in period. I just finished letting them play my radio Classical station for three days.
How does it feel?,"That's funny you should ask...my daughter, 10 years old, was telling me yesterday, how she likes the way it feels...especially the inside (it's kind of suede-like). Mine own came from Apple, but the ones for my husband, son, and daughter all bought here, different colors. They are identical to mine, just a few bucks cheaper. I did originally buy a different one for my husband (him telling me not to spend too much) and it was so cheaply made, two pieces, rough around the edges. I was worried about these, just not knowing for sure what I'd be getting, but we've been very pleased. I can't tell the difference between mine from the Apple store and theirs. The outside is leather-like and no rough edges, just nice to hold. Let me know if you need more info. Oh, and I paid $23 for each of ours through the Amazon Used program...they were like new, if not new. Couldn't see any difference between new and used."
Is this case for the 1st Gen iPad Air or the iPad Air 2?,Is just for iPad first gen
Why won't you ship to Puerto Rico?,We do. I will double check out settings.

Does the ipad SET inside as a complete cover or is the cover held on magnetically?,"The ipad case is formed it fit around the ipad. It essentially snaps into the case, only the cover is held on magnetically."
Is this a true red color? Or does it have an orangey tinge like so many phone/ipad cases?,"Has the orange tinge, not a true red."
Does this fit an Ipad Air?,No you need to look up a smart case or cover that specifically fits the iPad air on Amazon
Does it fit ipad 4th ?,"I think so as mine is the 3rd, the phiscal size should be the same"
does it fit ipad 2,It fits Ipad Air 2- that is what I have on mine.
Why is the light gray version $32.99? Is it used? Does it fit the iPad 3?,my cases are 23.88 and under with free shipping! you might have click on someone else store.

is it the Apple manufactured original smart case?,Hi I'm not sure about that but I have now three of those covers for 3 iPads being used by my kids and we are really happy with them.
Does this fit the ipad 4?,"Yes, I believe it is specifically for the iPad 4. I'm not sure if it fits previous iPads but I know the original version is thicker and more boxy than the 4 so this one specifically fits 4 perfectly."
"Is this compatible with the original iPad, not the iPad 2 or 3?","No, the iPad 1st generation is thicker. Apple did make a nice black case for it though. I'd get one of those or otterbox made defender cases as well"
does this act as a stand for reading,Yes you can stand it on two different sides of the triangle. Works really good. Love this cover.
How to clean the leather smart case for ipad?,My case is not leather. It is some kind of synthetic material. I just use a damp cloth to wipe it clean.
Does this cover both front and back?,Yes.
Will this fit an IPAD AIR ?,NO. Ipad Air is smaller. They now have smart cases for the new ipad Air. This one is bigger!
Does this cover work with iPad third generation?,"Yes, that is what I have and it is made for the 3rd and 4th generation. I actually saw some of these at our local Target last week.&#128522;"
does it work with apple ipad air,No it is too big
will it fit iPad mini 3?,No I don't believe so it fits the iPad 2 perfectly the mini would be too small
Is this authentic apple cover,"Yes it is. The original one I purchased from Verizon and this is the identical one...same color too, lol."

does this work with extreamview receivers?,"Do you mean the viewsat extreme? I use it with the viewsat ultra and ultra lite have not tried it with the viewsat extreme. You can go to FTABeta .com and ask the question there, they will help you."

dose this router work witha sonivew 360p,No friend
Will this dongle router work with captive works 700 or 800 ?,Yes it will

"I want to connect my blu-ray player and my Roku 3 to my tv, but the tv only has one hdmi port. Is this device what I need to connect both?","No, you will not want a splitter but switch. It might be worth getting a switch with a remote also so you can switch between the blu-ray and roku without getting up to physically switch the input on the device. Something like http://www.amazon.com/Portta-PET0301S-HDMI-Switcher-Support/dp/B00B46XUQU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1388753107&sr=8-1&keywords=hdmi+switch"
will this send signal to two different displays if they are each a different size or do both TVs need to be identical?,"In this case, size doesn't matter."
I bought this to connect my direct tv genie and blu ray player to my tv. I can get Dtv or blu ray but not both. Do I need 2 inputs?,This is to allow you to take one ooutput to two TVs. You need a different device entirely to switch between inputs on a TV.
"Some splitters say they support 1080p, but thats only on the input and they output 720p. Anyone know if this device will truely output 1080p?","Yes, it does. I'm using it to drive 2 monitors. It handles 1080p without any problems."
Does this device transmit audio too?,"Yes! 5.1 still works fine, I haven't tested 7.1 but I expect the original audio stream is passed straight through so anything that works over HDMI should work through the box."
Does it display both signals Simultaneously? I need to use it for DJ Karaoke...,Yes it does
Does both Outputs (Tv and Projetor) need to be On or I can use with one of them Off??,Either one can be off.
Do I have to press a switch to use either tv?,The signal is sent to both outputs all the time. You can use either tv or both at once.
With a Verizon STB (FIOS) the HDMI outputs splitter. One HDTV gets no sound. The other HDTV gets sound. Shouldn't both HDTVs get sound from splitter?,"Yes, I would think so. Have you tried reversing the cables in the ports to see if the other unit gets sound? Also, try switching the cables on each unit. Could be a bad cable or port."
Dose it work with Apple TV ?,yes is a splitter any system use hdmi clone the signal in two o more
DOes this switch have PoE? If so is it all of just some of the ports?,"SG100-16 does not have PoE ports. The SG100D-08P does, but has only 8 ports. See here for more details: http://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/switches/small-business-smart-switches/prod_ov_C22-587115.pdf"
"Hi, I would like to order 2 units of this product but I want to clarify first if the remaining units is rackmountable..",This unit is rackmaountable. Its smaller in size but comes with wide brackets.

Does this switch use a mechanical fan? Or is a fanless design?,Fanless
Is the unit wall mountable?,yes
Which port is the up link port? does it matter to what port I connect my router?,You can connect it to any port on the switch. Most modern switches use N-Way ports so you can connect it to any port without a crossover cable.
Is this switch rack mountable ?,"Yes it is. The switch size is smaller than standard cabinets width, so It come with wide brackets."
Does this support (LACP) Link Aggregation (802.3ad)?,"No, this is a very basic switch."
is it quite?,"Yes, very quite."
How warm does this thing get under load?,"Mine is installed with 8 active channels used and half of them are Gigabit connections.

Are there bulbs work on 220 volts,no 110-120 volt only.
Can u use a step down transformer to convert 110v to 220 v,I don't see why not. http://www.amazon.com/STEP-DOWN-TRANSFORMER-ADAPTER-300W/dp/B0036ZKCAY

Can i use these lights for outdoors?,"They aren't gonna be much use against daylight, not v strong"
Does anyone know if this wireless camera works with the Samsung SDS-P5100?,"As per the Samsung website (a Google find) under this model, it states: Supported Models: SDE-4001N, SDE-5001N, SDE-4002N, SDE-5002N, SDE-3001N, SDE-3003N, SDE-4004N There may be more that people discovered via trail and error. Try Googling the model number."
what is the viewing angle ?,The viewing angle is about 45-46 degrees.
What is the maximum distance from the receiver can the camera be placed??,"Maximum distance for ""most"" wifi cameras is 150'. The signal depletes or reduces over distance and any objects in between camera & receiver diminishes the signal. The user manual does not specify."
Can it be used with an HDMI A/V adapter? If so which one? My TV/Monitor does not support composite video (single channel) or A/V over RJ-45...,No I don't believe you can use an HDMI but a friend told me about an adapter that I was gonna try and use before I found an old TV in storage.
"what is the max range from the camera to the receiver for a clear signal? can the signal travel through windows, walls and doors ok?","I believe the technical max range is 300 feet but that is probably if there are no obstructions. I have had no problems using the camera from anywhere inside my house. But when I took it outside, which was about 40 feet away from the transmitter and had several walls in between, the signal had some issues. Overall I really like this camera and it works very well for my needs."
Does each camera require its own base? Or can I run 2-3 cameras that wirelessly connect to a single base?,I don t know coz I bought only 1 with it s base ....never tried to connect more than 1
What is it's viewing range at night?,"Samsung states 50ft, I would say that is accurate. I would, however, suggest lights to help with clarity. I have security lights in my back yard as well and they help out a lot. They are always on, and when there is motion, they come on brighter."
Does this camera work with the SDE-5001 model,"Yes. I've used mine with this camera. 8 wired, and 4 wireless."
does this wireless camera work with the samsung dvr sdr-4200?,"I do not know about a sdr-4200, but it does work with a SDE-4001N, and a SDE-4001 which has a either-net input. The audio also works with our model."

Does his copy CD mp3 to a blank CD..? A copy just like it?---I want to copyu dvd to CD...and CD to DVD format..willthis do that?,"I've only copied DVD to DVD or CD to CD with it. I've never tried DVD to CD or CD to DVD, so I am unsure...but my guess is that it will not."
well the copy play back in a reg vcr player,"No, it copies CDs and DVDs, not VHS tapes. The discs play back very well, though."
Can I copy a DVD-R to another DVD-R? One of the reviews mentions the master must be +R or +RW.,I have had no problem what I have copied +R to -R ore vice versa
will this copy a scratch/skip disc?,Same answer as before...a scratch disc is a damaged disc
in what speed does it copy in otherwords is it 2 hour speed or can you change speeds?,There is no option to choose a recording speed. It copies exactly as recorded on the master disc.... and it takes only 2 to 4 minutes.
Will this machine copy an 8.5gb DL DVD +R to an 8.5gb DL DVD +R?,"I'm not real familiar about all that modern technology stuff, but I have copied DVD's before, on other DVD's, and they do just fine. If I'm not mistaken I have always used the DVDR's to copy onto, but don't know if it was copied from a DVDR though. I really don't think that there would be a problem with it. I just try it and if it works then it works, if it doesn't then you're in the same spot you were in. It might be a good idea to look up the Acumen Disc CD DVD Disc Copier on the computer to see what further details it will tell you about it. I wouldn't want to lead you astray on it, but I am very pleased with the copier. Sometimes if there is a block on the CD/DVD then it won't let you copy it though."
can it record from flash drive,No
"I'm a little confused, it says burner and writer -- does that mean it both burns content to and also writes text upon the cd/dvd?",No
I have original CDs that i want to protect : i want to copy them &amp; use the copies so my kids don't scratch the originals. Will that work ?,Most definately. This is the best machine for doing that all the way around. No computer needed to work. Very simple to use.
does this burn only DVD RW?,HI! No This burns them all! I have used Dvd +R and Dvd- with no problems! its great!!!! It will not burn copy right dvd's but everything else it will. Hope this helped you!
Will this copy using a finalized DVD-R (uncopyrighted home movie) as the source?,Yes. I copied all my home movies.

how long does it take to copy a disc?,About 4 minutes.
Will this unit copy old dvd movies and my own CD of music? Will it copy dvd muic discs and movies on dvd?,Yes
Does this machine have any other inputs that I can copy from .(e.g. a tape recorder ). Or does it only copy from another CD ? Thanks,"Hi, no, it does not have any external connection to connect to other devices. This machine is standalone and is strictly a disc to disc copy within the duplicator. It does not have a hub or external connection to copy from other external device (ie. desktop PC, camcorder, or any other audio device)."
"I have a DVD player in a van, with children the dvds get scratched often, can I make copies of movies that we own like shriek and stuff for the van",No you cannot copy protected movies directly.there are no copiers that will do that.you would first have find a program to remove the protection using your computer making a unprotected copy of the disk which is called a backup than your able to copy from that point.
I want to make copies of a 3-hour DVD. Will this machine do that? Do I need dual-layer target discs? Thanks.,"I have not had any trouble with my disc copier, I have not copier a 3 hour dvd, what I have copied came out just fine."
Do you need a certain make of DVD? I have tried a few but none will copy. A CD will copy. That's why I think its the dvd thats not right.,I have used all brands if DVD from staples brand to Sony and they all copy just fine with this machine.
So am I correct in assuming it will play a blu-ray disk and just a regular DVD disk and a 3d disk all 3 with just this one machine?,"If 3D and HD are the same thing then yes, it pays all three formats. Netflix, YouTube and Internet ready. It can get wonky and have moments, but so far this replacement has worked out!"
The website I am trying to stream (calvarygc.org) says it needs adobe flash player. How do I get this and store it for later use&gt;,"I am not sure that you can. There are some streaming sites that are only set up for computer use, and maybe not for this player. The ""channels"" that you can get are already preprogramed on it, like Amazon Prime, Netflix and Vudu, along with many others. I would check on the Sony site for questions and their trouble shooting knowledge base for this player. I would also check the website that you are trying to stream and see if they have any information on if what you can stream it on."
Will i get subtittles on netflix?,"Yes, it's different than when watching a DVD. With a DVD there's a button on the remote. With Netflix you have to stop the video, which returns you to a window that's one step from browse. Scroll down 2-3 items, select. then scroll back up. not the easiest, but it works. Image quality on WiFi is pretty good, actually better and smoother than on my MacBook Pro."
Does this player come with a remote?,the remote control is not included with this dvd player.
"I can watch Amazon Instant Videos using this DVD player, but do not know how to enable subtitles when watching them. Is there a way?","I have Netflix, the CC are a function of Amazon. If no one here answers how to do it your best bet is to call Amazon tech support. CC works fine with Netflix."
"purchased two of this item DVD...both stop after about 15 min., / purchased a Brava flat screen 3D to match system..the flat sceens ok ,advise.serv","Sorry but I will need more information. What do you mean by ""stop after 15 min"" ? Was it no power at all or would not play a DVD? I have been using my Sony for years and occasionally have to unplug it and replug it in to clear internal glitches, but other than that I have had no trouble at all."
will it stream mlbtv,I see no reason why it wouldn't....Best source for accuracy is Sony Corp. Might give them a call. But I have had no problem with any bcst via any means feeding it and it feeding my home theatre.
does this model use rca inputs? can i use it with an old tv?,Yes
Streams Netflix just fine but not Amazon?,Its stream Amazon at 720p. It uses the older gui.
can this Blu ray player play mkv files,"yes! I play mkv files on mine from an external hard drive. Occasionally the mkv will not read well on the blu ray player, even though it plays on a computer, but this is rare. good luck! -Jay"
"Can this tablet connect directly to a computer, and does it have Android/Google Market to get applications?",It has google play and I have downloaded several apps some are free some as little as 99 cents I have also copied things from my computer to the tablet through the usb cord that came with it
does it have bluetooth?,"Nope, horrible, the chrge stopped working a month in, the volume is horrible, total waste of money, I ended getting my daughter a Kindel which is awesome."
"I bought this for my grandson for Christmas -- if I get him an amazon gift card can he use it to download games, etc ?",He should be able to because I have downloaded software from Amazon myself. You can download all kinds of things. By the way. I love my zeepad. I bought one for my granddaughter and she also loves it.
can this tablet take photographs or is it skype only,There is a built in camera and it takes pictures.
Well when I turn it on it stays on one screen what can I do to make it work all over again?,"Possibly a factory reset if you can get to settings. Note: This is a last ditch option. If you choose this route and can get to settings go to ""Backup and reset"". On a personal not, I'm not impressed with the ZeePad. Not even for the price. I would have gladly spent a little more for a better product."
how to get internet,"I had bought this in 2012, did not keep it, upgraded to a different brand."
Why it does not hold charge,Because there cheap and piece of junk!
Support for hdmi through mhl adapter cable?,The screen went black on my granddaughter after 7 days and then came back on after a month - no reason and has been fione ever since
Can this tablet take videos?,Yes
how can I get a user's manual?,Don't know Google it that pad is pretty good but volume sucks sorry

What is the exact height without the stand as it is to go on a kitchen counter corner under a kitchen cabinet.,"15 and """
"Can this TV be used with ""Standard"" Definition cable service, if you do not have ""High Definition service?""","Yes but the picture wont fill out the screen, but yes the tv has a tv tuner."
Is this TV powered via 120VAC or is a wall WART used converting 120VAC to 12VDC? This is for a motorhome so I want to be able to run it on 12vdc.,"The TV is 120 VAC, but being an old truck driver I'm sure it would run just fine on a power inverter"
Can you use it as a monitor,Yes no problem at all
How is this in the gaming regards adn what ports aside from hdmi does this tv have?,"Component Video Inputs 1 PC Inputs 1 USB Inputs 1 (Music and Photo) Coaxial Output 1 Headphone Jack As Far as gaming, I haven't used it for that."
Do Roku Streaming Sticks work on this TV not regular ROKU 1 2 3 ect. but the Roku stick from Roku?,"Daniel, I'm sorry but I do not know. I purchased this for a customer."
Can you mount this tv on the wall,"Yes you can. Obviously you will need to supply the mount and the screws. Just make sure the mount states VESA compatible, and the screws will need to be M8."
Is the television sold with a stand?,Yes it does come with one. Looks and works great too.
Warranty included? How long ?,Yes warranty is included for 1yr
How do i unlock my zeepad?,Is there a passcode?
Log me out of face book,Not sure what the question is but I would not buy this product. My son and I both purchased and the charging jack ln the pad failed on both. Can't charge can't use.
I bought 2 for Christmas 1 for me and 1 for my 10 yr old granddaughter......I spent 180.00 for the 2 and now neither one works. My grand stopped working 2 months ago and mine today. They won't charge or turn on what do I need to do?.........Please...,"Yeah, this is my experience with these pieces of junk. I had three in my house, all were dead within several months. ""You get what you pay for"" still applies, I guess."
"How can I lock my home page. Some ""Zandroid.com"" or KSZZ.com keeps resetting it to their site.","I have the same problem. I can change the homepage on my ?PAD HH017 4Gb Light blue tablet and when I switch away and return to the browser or the screen locks, when I return the browser has reset to an article on KSZZ.com and the homepage as well has reset to the same page. It's so annoying! Does anyone know how to stop this activity? I have installed Avast Mobile AV and scanned the tablet twice and found nothing. Any help is appreciated."
why would it freeze up,Mine broke just after we bought it. Let the battery die and recharge it after it dies and see unfit resets.
Can I download kindle on this?,"Yes I had no problem doing anything on it ,,, just dnt drop it my power button broke off and doesn't work at all now!!"
How to connect your kids zeepad,Wireless settings
how to get it started,Charge the unit for a few hours then hit the power button- 1st charge takes some time
Where can I find a user manual that is big enough to read and has the words and spelling correct. It's obvious the manufacture had a child type it.,"I'm sorry, can't really help you. I bought it for my granddaughter 2 years ago, who doesn't live close. I did find out it stopped working a few months after she it. I bought it so we could Tango, that didn't work. I think my review wasn't a happy one."
Can you read books on the zeepad?,Yes
Does the clip fit on a Nook Simple Touch (or on a Nook cover)?,"I don't have a nook, but it fits on my kindle. You can open the clip very wide. About an inch."
how long does the battery last?,"Hard to say. I use it to light my keyboard when I'm on my computer in the dark. It's lasted me for about 2 months now, but when I use it I usually only use it for up to an hour and I do use it quite often though."
"Are there multiple intensities for the light, or just on/off?",Just on and off
Can the bulb be replaced if needed?,"Its a LED bulb that will last hundreds of hours - there is a super tiny screw at the base where the light bulb housed, but I would guess from looking at it the answer is no. I love mine!"
Is the light enough to see two pages of a hardcover book or just one? Or does the light have to be adjusted to aim at each side?,"It generally only provides enough for one side of the book, but that also depends on how bright you like it for reading. I like a lot of light but my husband feels it provides enough light for both pages of a hardcover book. Additionally, it is very easy to adjust. Easier than my other book light."
how heavy is the light,84 GRAMS- VERY LIGHT
I'd like to give it as a favor at my kid's birthday party. How tall are these little book lights? Need to find the right gift bag size! Thank you !,"They are 11 inches when flat, but you can bend the arm down to make then just 5 inches long."
Are all four lights for $13.99 or just one?,"You receive all four lights for the price listed, not just one :)"
There seems to be an adaptor where you could plug it in to electricity at one end. what is this for and where do I buy an adaptor to plug in.,"Yes on top there is a port where you can plug the reading light into an outlet. I tried my baby monitors charger and it worked on it. This is the charger model I have and you can find it right here on Amazon, hope this answered your question! http://www.amazon.com/UpBright%C2%AE-Adapter-GPE060A-060080-1-Monitor-Charger/dp/B00KA415KA"
Does each light come in it's own package?,Yes
does this work for nikon G lens as well?,"If you want to be able to set aperture on a G lens, you need this one I think: http://www.amazon.com/Fotodiox-Adapter-DX-Type-Fujifilm-Mirrorless/dp/B008BBI72I"
Will this work with my dad's old AI lenses?,"Yes. There are two versions as I understand it. The second, which I did not purchase, handles later lenses that do not have an aperture ring - I think it has its own aperture settings while the lens remains wide open. I kept several Dx lenses and DSLRs but have not tried the Dx lenses with this adapter. I think the only way they can be used is wide open, which is rather pointless. I am mounting on a Fuji X-Pro1 with a Micro-Nikkor 55mm f/2.8 (circa late 1970s) - works fine, of course manual focus only."
"Hi, i was about to buy this product for a fujifilm X-T1 but then i wondered if it works, and how it performs with DX Nikkor lenses. anyone? thanks","Most DX lenses are ""G"" designated and missing the aperture ring. This adapter does not carry any data from the lens to the camera. It also has no mechanical connection. Therefore, most DX lenses will be stuck at the smallest aperture and photos would be severely underexposed. With this adapter, you must focus and set your exposure manually. If your lens has an aperture ring and focus ring, this well-built adapter works fabulously. With focus peaking, manually focusing is a pretty quick and easy task. Keep in mind, the exif data will be missing info like aperture setting."
Are you guys able to adjusts the aperture on the Nikon lenses?,I got my adapter so that I could use my older Nikon lenses with my Fujifilm X mount camera. The adapter will work with any manual focus Nikon lens (such as AI or AIS) or their D type autofocus lenses. The S type and newer lenses have no aperture rings and will not work properly with the adapter.
Does this converter create a focal length conversion beyond the magnification caused by fuji's smaller sensor size? Light loss?,"1. re focal length conversion--no. 2. re light loss--I have not noted any--but, frankly, I am usually using any / all of my adapter with a fixed f-stop setting or with AE."
will this work on the XE1 as well.. I would think it should but would like to confirm .... Thanks,"Yes, I'm using it on an XE1. Of course you get no autofocus, and you have to enable a menu in the setup that allows the camera to take a picture without a lens. You should manually specify the focal length as well. There's an article about it: http://www.fujirumors.com/adapting-third-party-lenses/"
Does this work for Nikon DX lenses and does it still meter well when manually changing the aperture?,"This adaptor works with Nikon lenses that have a manual aperture ring, providing for manual metering in the Fuji camera body. It will mount a DX lens but without aperture control. There is another Fotodiox adaptor that is specifically for Nikon G and DX lenses."
Does this work with Fuji XE2? I am mounting Nikon AIS lens to Fuji Xe2. Thank you!,Yes I use this to mount afd lenses to my xe2.
Will this fit my new Nikon V1 300 Camera,Well this one would not. It is designed to adapt Nikon F-mount lenses to Fuji X-mount cameras.
I noticed the Fotodiox does not have an aperture ring. How does one adjust aperture when using this adapter?,"You need to eather use objectives with aperture ring or get an adaptor with a lever to control objective aperture. I like well builded, all metal, aperture ringed objectives, they feel great and give you full control, focusing, deph of field, exposure :)"
will this fit the sony a7s?,"No, this one is for the Fuji X series cameras!"
"So, this adapter works for example with this lens: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000...","Hello, Yes, that lens works with this adapter and Fuji X mount cameras."
Does it work with Minolta AF Lens on a Fuji X-E1?,"Yes, but only with the correct lens adapter mount."
Does a 25 year old Minolta Maxxum lens adapt to a new Fujifilm X-E2..?,"Well, where I'm from the Minolta series is called Dynax and I have a 700si. The Fotodiox fits very well on the 50mm Macro & 75-300mm zoom lens for my Fuji X-e1. I believe the mount should be the same for the Maxxum series lens. Additional point about this adapter: There are no click stops for aperture. So you're pretty much on your own for deciding what exact aperture you're on between ""Lock"" & ""Open"". I guess you can do your own calibration & make markings on the adapter, but the absence of click stops means that you'd have to look at the adapter to make an aperture change. Big bummer..."
Will this adaptor connect a Quantaray lens for Minolta Maxxum to a Nikon D60 camera body?,Yes it will. The Minolta lens is the same as a Sony alpha mount.
Will this work to convert a Minolta AF lens to a Nikon D5000? I don't see that one listed.,Yes .... this will work. All Nikon bodies have the same mount.
"The lens adapter and lenses work but the lighting is horrible, will an external flash help or am I doing something wrong?",Don't forget to manually adjust the aperture (the adjustment ring on the adapter). Wider aperture - &gt; more light gets in.
Will this adapter connect Minolta Maxxum lenses to a Nikon FM2n (F mount)?,"I have a Nikon D5100 and it worked seamlessly. Just take note that the electronics are different so you wont have the Auto Focus feature (or any other feature at all), meaning you have to use it in full manual control. This is a good choice for using Minolta lenses on your Nikon."
Will this work with a Nikon 3200 - I don't see that listed?,Yes
will this work on a sony a58?,Lens adapter is a metal ring that fits between a camera and a non-compatible lens. It enables any lens to be used with any camera.
"Hi, I hae a ols Minolta Maxxum with lenses Maxxum AF(this lenses can not work in manualy, dont have aperture ring). Now I bougth a Nikon D5200 and I w",My Nikon D200 did not recognize that there was a lens on the camera when I tried to use this adapter. I have seen other reviews that it worked for other people but it did not for me.
"hi,do anybody know if this adapter works with Nikon D3200? thank you!!!",yes it will.
just want to know if this adapte r works with Nikon d3200? thank you,Hello. This adapter did not work with my Nikon D3200. I received an error message on my camera that it could not find a lens so would not take any pictures. I could not even focus the lens manually since the camera did not recognize there was a lens at all.
will this allow for auto aperture or auto anything?,"No, see that blue little thing, and 6 circle indications ? You turn that to choose one of 6 stops . No exactly aperture number will show on camera screen. Fully manual focus, manual aperture control with 6 stops"
Does autofocus work with EF 50mm F1.8 ??,"No, there is no electronic control with this lens adapter."
Does this work with Sony A7 at full frame mode?,"On my A7 it works perfectly ok with my canon lenses. Not so good was the Tokina 12-24mm, but they were really meant for APS sensors anyway, and A Rokinon 8mm fisheye. Hopelessly vignetted, as in literally half the frame missing."
Does this work with Sony NEX EA50?,Can't say. It does work with the NEX VG-20. I'm assuming it works with any NEX cameras but you'd have to use manual settings. AF will not work.
what about NEX 5R?,"works great for converting quality lens for my sony new vg10. I have a converter for canon L lens and older nikon lens, you can get great deal with craigslist. I shoot video and the only problem is manuel shooting, which I do anyway to control f stops for right bocla. any other question give me a message dennislockhart2000@yahoo.com"
"I have a sony Alpha 100 digital camera and like to use a 50 mm canon lense on it, does this adapter work for me ?",As long as your lense is Ef compatible it will work with the adapter
I'm guessing image stabilization (IS / OIS) doesn't work?,Yes
Can you remove the tripod mount?,Eu consigo montar o trip sem precisar tirar o adaptador. E consigo tirar o adaptador ou coloc-lo sem precisar tirar a cmera do trip.
Does this work with the A6000?! If so is there any problems?...,I have used it on my a6000 witha couple Canon lenses. It works great for me.
Has anyone noticed excessive lens flares using this in conjunction with any lens?,I haven't. Flares really shouldn't be a problem as you are only extending the distance from the rear element to the sensor. My setup doesn't exhibit that problem
"Does this thing work with Sony A6000, I've bunch of Canon EF lenses, will it allow me to use them on Sony A6000.","Sony A6000 has E-mount lenses, so you need to look for E-mount to camera and EF- mount to lens side adapter."
I want to fit a Hanimex manual focus Hoya SHYLIGHT (1B) 58mm telephoto lense to a Canon EOS 1100d camera. What adapter is required?,"What is the mount of the Hanimex lens? You need to know the base mount on the lens before you can select an adapter. For example, if the mount is M42, then you will need an M42-to-EOS adapter. If you are looking to buy a lens, ask the seller of the lens what the mount is."
Can I use a 58mm screw in lens with this adapter for my Canon T3i rebel?,"This adapter is used for mounting Nikon brand and ""Nikon mount"" lenses on Canon cameras such as T3i Rebel. I cannot be used with screw in lenses."
"Will the nikon 24-70 f2.8 work? it is an f-mount, i believe and i don't want to replace a $2000 lens",I am sorry :-( I dont know photography gear very well I only know that it works fine fitting m'y 50mm Nikon on m'y Canon 5D mark ii. dorry again.
Can I use my Sigma 70-300mm lens for my Canon 70D? What adapter do I need?,If your Sigma 70-300 has a Nikon Mount the Fotodiox lens mount adapter will work fine - as a manual lens.
What if I want to this adapter on a Nikon 35mm 1.8 on a Canon 5d Mark III?,It should work. It will fit very snug on the camera and super tight on the lens so don't expect to be able to switch the adaptor to another lens quickly. I don't like shooting with my adaptor when unknown I will have to change lenses at all quickly.
I just bought this but doesn't seem to work with Sigma 18-35 onto my Blackmagic 4k. Any thoughts?,"You need to be more descriptive about how it does not work. For example, does it mount to the lens? Does it mount to the camera? Does it mount but the camera won't start?"
"I ordered this for my canon 1d mark iii. I want to see if my dads old nikon lenses will work, they're probably 30 years old! Do u think it'll work?",It would depend what the lenses are. there are 2 adaptors for Nikon lenses. I know because I accidentally ordered a different one from Fotodiox before this one.
"It states Nikon G (D-Type) - I have Nikon D90 lens, I want to use them on my Canon D60... will this mount adapter work?",Sorry I don't know. It worked on my Panasonic AF100 but I don't know if it is the same mount as a D60. It did seem well made.
Can this adapter be used on my AF Nikkor 50mm 1.8 Len and mount to my Canon EOS XTi?,"Not sure, I use the adaptor on a manual Nikon lens for my T3i and 70D The AF feature of the lens might be disabled however, you would need to keep it in manual mode"
Does it also works on T2i?,"Yes, Chris, the adapter works with the T2i and all the other DSLR Canon EOS cameras."
"I need to mount a Minolta maxxum AF zoom 75-300mm to my Canon t2i. Will this adapter fit? If not, what?","Yes but I highly DO NOT recommend it. As I said before about the optical piece in it, magnifies it by 1.4x and with other lens beyond about f1.8 or so will stay around there because the optically piece is only so big. Secondly with any AF lens you want that function to work but this adapter does not connect the electrical components. I recommend if you want to use a zoom lens with AF then buy a Canon one I bought the 55-250 works greats cost between 125-175avg used if you dont mind for cheaper it will save you in the long run. Because for me after spending so much with my Minoltas I finally got a Canon for my Canon and looking back I should've avoided the adapter. Hope that helps."
I have two tamron lenses (tele macro 70-210mm and AF 35-80) with a Minolta AF mount. Does this adaptor fits my lenses to a Canon EOS camera? Thanks!,"I agree with Juan J's answer. The lenses I tried were Minolta, Maxxum, Sigma, Quantaray and Tamron and Sony Alpha, and they worked okay on a Canon 7d and Canon Rebel both digital and film, but not as well as when attached to Maxxum or Sony dslr cameras. To reiterate, the lenses need manual focus and aperture on Canon EOS cameras."
Will works with canon d20?,"I have one on a Canon EOS 40D. It will not be a perfect match. You'll have to learn to use the camera with the adapter. Lenses will fit, you'll be shooting using manual settings and the adapter lens in front of the camera sensor will reduce image quality slightly."
"I have a Quantaray AF 60-200 that fits on my Minolta Maxxum 7000 AF. Will this adapter allow me to put the Quantaray on a Canon T3i and if so, what are the drawbacks? Thanks","Because it's for AF series, it should fit. Drawbacks are there's no autofocus and manual f-stop."
Will works with canon rebel xti,I'm using with a Canon 5D M-II. It works perfectly!
I want to use a Minolta AF reflex 500 lens on a Canon EOS rebel T3i camera will this adapter work? if not can you suggest an adapter that would? Is there another adapter that would work better for this lens ?,"Thank you for asking. Yes you can, but you will need to manually focus as there is no electronics in this adapter."
Can this len mount adapter be used for my Canon EOS 5D camera Mark II?,"The adapter fits beautifully, but the quality of the image was fuzzy that it could not be used. It was not an issue of focus but the optical quality of the glass inside the adapter. I was very disappointed that I was unable to use this with my minolta/sony lenes. One thing to consider is that I bought the item used and could have been this particular adapter was defective. If you purchase one, I recommend buying a new one only. Please give us a report of your experience if you do. Thanks"
I have a Minolta AF 28-135 1:4-4.5 lens want to fit it on EOS Canon 6D will this adapter work?,"Yea I probably, the only think you need to have in mind is, you gonna need to focus yourself"
Will this work on a Canon EOS Rebel T5 (not the T5i)?,"Since the Canon Rebel T5 is compatible with any Canon EF or EF-S lens, then yes: this adapter should work with your T5."
"I have Tamron 70-500 lens fitted on the Konica Minolta Dymax 7D body, will this converter fit this lens on my Canon 600D?","If the mount is an alpha mount then yes, once again please refer to my other post about this product. Biggest tip here if you don't feel like researching more - zoom lens are horrible for the adapter because minolta(sony) has their equivalent (image stabilizer) in the body whereas Canon in the lens. So unless you have a surgeons hands or using a tripod all the time your images will blurr."
Will this Neutral Density filter fit on my D90 with an AF-5 Nikkor 18-55mm DX lens?,"The filter size for your lens is : Filter/attachment size 52mm, Choose the Neutral Density filter 52mm for your lens."
It's soft or hard transition filter?,Soft
"Does this filter equivalently 0,6ND ( or ND4 )?",No its not. Its half clear and half ND which fades in a transition at the intersection along the diameter. Another version called reverse graduated gradual 1/2 ND is also available with darker side along the diameter and lighter end at the periphery.If you are looking for more versatility but surely at the cost of usability might try Cokin P SERIES square filters
Can anyone provide with the actual inside measurements? I want to see if I can fit an item that is 14x7.5x15. Thanks.,Inside it's 17.25 x 7.4 x 13.5
How high does the handle go?,"The handle can be raised and fixed at three different detented positions. The heights that are most useful are 31 inches and 39 inches above the surface on which the bag rests, upright."
This purchase is for a Dell M-18 computer with the compatibility dimensions of 17.5 in x 13.5 in x 3 in. Will it fit?,"I don't think so - the interior pocket I just measured is just over 17"" (like 17.1"") You are going to have to get a custom case for that. It is tough enough to find a case that will fit a 17.3 diag laptop. Sorry."
How big of a laptop would this fit?,"It fit my 17-inch, but DO NOT slide one that side into the pocket towards the back of the case by the handle, or its a booger to get back out again. But there is a better pocket for it toward the front."
is there an area for file folders,"You can use the 'computer sleeve' inside the bag for file folders, or place them inside the front flap. However, if you are asking about HANGING FOLDERS, the answer is no. It is designed with an open concept -- perfect for folks like me who carry ring binders and software text books."
"I need to carry a macbook pro and an epson projector (measuring 11x13x3.5"") and one binder. Will these items fit in this case? Thank you in advance.","Yes. I believe this case can accomplish that for you, depending on the size of your binder. I have a Mac Book Pro and tested this for you this morning. Mac will tuck in an interior side pocket. It will be slightly separated from the remaining portion of the interior of the case. I think the maximum remaining space in the case would hold an object with 12x16x5 dimensions. This is a really nice case and is spacious. I would highly recommend, especially at this price point."
will the side pocket fit a iPad?,"I don't have an iPad but the side pocket is 7"" wide by 10"" long and could hold something about 1"" thick."
My Dell 5000 is 16 and a quarter plus wide and 11 and a quarter deep. Will it fit in the computer compartment? Pat,Yes with room to spare
are the dividers removable?,No
How high does the handle go when extended?,25 in from the lid of the bag and 39 in from the floor
will it work with panasonic fz100?,"As the manufacturer has access to a much larger inventory of lenses than most of us do, I suggest you contact the manufacturer directly. Regards, Jim"
"I have a Canon Zoom Telephoto EF 75-300mm f/4.0-5.6 III Autofocus Lens, will this lens collar fit it properly? Thanks.","No, this was designed for the Canon EF 100mm f/2.8 L II IS. I do not have the lens you quote, but from the pictures online, I does not look compatible."
Will it fit on Rebel XS body?,It actually fits around the lens. The lens attaches to the body. The idea is to get better balance of the lens-body combination when sitting on a tripod.
What is the interior diameter of the lens collar?,The minimum inner diameterr is 69 mm. The maximum is ~ 70.5 mm.
Does this fits for Canon EF 70-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM Lens?,"No, the Fotodiox Pro ring is made for the Canon 70-300mm f4-5.6 L lens which is larger in diameter and has a 1inch open area for the ring to fit. This ring fits perfect on the above lens only. I just checked this on my older lens like yours."
What is the inside diameter of the collar in millimeter or inch? Thanks.,It's 3 inches and 3/16.
"I have a Canon Zoom Telephoto EF 75-300mm f/4.0-5.6 III Autofocus Lens, will this lens collar fit it properly? Thanks.",No this will only fit the 70/300L lens.
"What is th inside diameter of the ring, I have a 70-300mm IS USM but not the L version and wondering if it will fit","Sorry, it will only fit the 70-300mm IS L version..."
where does it ship from,This item ships from our warehouse located in Illinois.
how do you fold it,"it's folds into a disk by twisting it over itself, like making a fugure 8. it took us a few tries to figure it out in the beginning as it's a large screen and a bit cumbersome to fold."
how do you get rid of the wrinkles,"For me, one side (the one with the tail) had a lot of wrinkles but the other side didn't have any, so I just used the side with no wrinkles. If they both have bad wrinkles, I suppose you could slide an ironing board underneath the chromakey (without standing the board up), and iron it the same way you'd iron clothes."
Can I lay it on its side against a wall with it facing backwards so the floor sheet is hidden?,Yeah but I kind if regret it now because I can't fold it up and its just collecting dust.the side that connects to the the plastic rips kind of easy if you are not careful. If you can learn to fold it right it will be ok.
"How big is the collapsible green screen, not the sheet.",It is the size of an SUV tire when its collapsed
When using as light how bright does these get? When using as a strobe how bright are they? How quickly do they recharge?,"Full power strobe they put out enough power to set my camera to f/16, ISO 100, 1/250...they recharge less than 1/2 sec...they have model lights but I don't use them so I don't have the measurements."
"Got my kit and none of the model lights work and one strobe came with a piece of tape on it with the initials ""NFG"" on it. Where do I get bulbs?????","Hi, my little modeling light bulbs came with mine. They are small and were in three seperate little white boxes if I remember right. I don't remember where in the bag there were at but you might wanna look around again just a thought and if you threw anything away check that too if you still can. Otherwise I don't know where to get the bulbs. I would suggest try online google the light set and go that route. Sorry I'm not much help otherwise."
Can you use this as a light and strobe?,yes..... it has a switch that lets you use it as both
I need to know how much the whole equipment weights.,"I just got it in the mail today. Unfortunately didn't weigh it before assembling it. But it comes packaged nicely in the duffle bag and I would guesstimate that it weighed 35 pounds. I'm an average height, strength guy and I could quite easily carry the loaded bag with one hand. It's more awkwardly sized than anything."
How much does this whole set up weigh,"I just got it in the mail today. Unfortunately didn't weigh it before assembling it. But it comes packaged nicely in the duffle bag and I would guesstimate that it weighed 35 pounds. I'm an average height, strength guy and I could quite easily carry the loaded bag with one hand. It's more awkwardly sized than anything."
Is this kit appropriate for a total beginner who wants to use it for portrait setups? My camera doesnt have a strobe setup,"Yes it could be... be sure you research exactly what you want before you buy. You may need different items if you are going to be indoor only vs. wanting to take these outside. Overall, as a beginner you could probably make this work in almost any situation because it's decent performance, light weight and quite portable."
Is it only for 110v or can it be used with 220v as well? It would severly hinder its portability if I had to be carrying a 110v to 220v converter.,110v 60 cycle only
Where can I get replacement modeling lights for this kit? The box says JCD GY6.35 120v 60w but I cannot find those anywhere!!,
Where can I find an owners manual or some form of instructions?,"This website has different manuals on putting softboxes together for fotodiox, I just went through it as I needed help on one thing or another""http://www.fotodiox.com/videos2.php?id=92"""
Does Fotodiox sell replacement Fuses? Or What type of fuse does the D320 Strobe take?,"I went to look on the fuse to see if it had any numbers written on them. They have some numbers embossed on one of the ends. They are hard to read if you don't have enough light and hold them the right way. But the number reads F15AL 250V, for anyone who has the same question. (I am the same person that asked the question, but on a friend's account since I can't answer my own question.)"
What is the difference between the D320 and the D220?,"320 refers to 320 Watts of power, so 220 is 220 Watts"
Hi. Does this kit comes with the wire to connect it directly to electricity? and with the wire that synchrorizes with te camera-,Yes it comes with allthe cables and wireless trigger
My modeling lights don't work. When I flick the switch on the back of the light head I get nothing. Am I missing a step?,"Nope that's the norm for these lights! check the fuse by the plug first, go to radioshack for new fuses. i had 2 of these lights that pop'ed and sparks came out I contacted the company, they sent me 2 new light heads opened the box 1 st one worked the 2nd one was dead on arrival it never ends with these! Lol so far I have 2 out of three that haven't given me issues in the last 2-3 months"
Does this kit come with bulbs for the strobes?,Yes
I want to buy this but need it quickly is it in stock and how long after I pay does it ship out? I will even pay extra for faster shipping,I paid for overnight shipping and it arrived the next lat morning.
Are the Flash tube bulb replaceable like the Halogen bulbs?,"Yes, its a plug in. I havent had to replace mine yet."
"Where can I see the assembly instructions, I received the kit but I dont know how to assembly it.","Every lighting kit that I have bought never did come with assembly instructions. If you Google or look on Youtube you can find video instructions on how to put together and put on Softboxes, Barndoors, or Snoots. Of course there are MANY different types of Softboxes and not all softboxes assemble the same."
What is the Collapsed size (DIA / WIDTH) ?,"When everything is stored in the zip-up case, it's 23"" across and about an inch thick."
"Ok, I must be missing it, but ""Product Dimensions: 1 x 1 x 1 inches;"" ? What are the dimensions of the reflectors?",I'm away from my house but it's big. At least 4x6 maybe 5x7. I bought one then bought 2 more. Good deal. I have a large manfrotto collapsable and it is one size smaller than that.
i would like to know the measurements for this product. Which i don't see it anywhere in the ad,"The reflector surface area is 46.5"" wide (with an edge a little over 0.25"" thick for a total width that's a little greater than 47.5"") and 69"" high (plus the edge for a total height a little greater than 70"")."
How many inches long is it when it is folded completely?,"about 28.5"""
I would like to purchase a Dual Head Angle Clamp for this stand. Is this a 28mm or a 31.5mm stand?,"If you're referring to the screw, it's a standard 1/4 inch tripod screw. so that would be 31.5. I don't know what you plan to put on it, but I wouldn't put anything very heavy on it."
how much weight does it hold?,"I have not maxed it out yet however I have put 20 pounds on it and have no issues I don't think 50 would be pushing it either... it is certainly not made out of titanium and I don't imagine it was made for heavy duty use at this price, but for small money it holds more than expected, as long as your expectations are reasonable."
Does it come with a case?,"No, they are just shipped in the packing box. No case is included."
How long is this when folded?,About three feet
What is the max height of the stand form the floor to the connection where the boom arm is?,about 6 feet could be alittle more
Are there directions for how to use this anywhere? I don't understand how to rotate it to hold the reflector and it didn't come with instructions.,Pull the top pole all the way up till it comes out of the hole.
"Hello, it comes with his own bag?","If you mean a bag to contain the lightstand, no it doesn't. The only bag is the sand bag for weighing the boom down. The ""heavy duty"" in this item's name is very accurate - or at least the heavy part. Don't buy this if you're looking for something portable!"
What are the dimensions of the delivery box? I am considering asking a friend to bring this out from the USA and am trying to determine if feasible.,"It's about 6x6x48 but it's HEAVY, at least 30 lbs. Check with Amazon for details."
I don't see how to attach a reflector to this. Where are the clamps?,I have this stand and it's awesome but you need to buy the clamps seperately.
where can i get a Reflector studs replacement? mine broke off.,Try www.BandH.com Phone number is 800-947-7785
Does this product includes the boom arm? If this is the case how much weight can the arm hold and what is it&Acirc;&acute;s maximum lenght?,It does include the boom arm. Max load weight is listed at 20 lbs and maximum arm length is 7 feet.
"will it grip a 60"" x 80"" reflector?""","Yes, it will, I've used it for the better part of 6 months and it's worth every penny."
what is the max size reflector this will hold?,I measured the maximum jaw distance to be 82 inches with the tubes fully extended. I think once you get to that span stability might become an issue. However it is an impressively robust tripod.
I couldn't find the max height info for this unit in any website. Can someone please tell me what's the max height with boom stand and without it?,Mine are 10 ft... They make a 12 ft also.
I saw a post that it worked with Kubuntu. Using for XBMC that has Lubuntu 12.04. What drivers if any will be needed?,"The disk that came with mine had only Windows drivers. The pertinent question is what is the chipset used in this Bluetooth device, because Linux drivers will be written to the chipset, not to the brand name on the outside of the device. The device looks like a Broadcom BMC20702 device to Windows, so I would look for drivers for that device. That does not directly answer the question but it is the best I can do."
"Could I transmit with this device? For example, output audio to a bluetooth stereo receiver from my PC?",I can't comment as to whether you can transmit audio to a bluetooth stereo receiver but I do transmit audio from my PC to a bluetooth speaker. I would assume then you should be able to transmit audio to a bluetooth stereo receiver.
Does this item support plug &amp; play for Windows 8?,"No, you will need to install the drivers. The link to the drivers can be found at: http://www.satechi.net/index.php/computer-accessories/network-adapters/satechi-bluetooth-4-0-usb. For further assistance, please email support@satechi.com. Thank you, Satechi Technical Support"
Does this item support plug &amp; play for Windows 7?,Not fully. It comes with a driver CD that you should install to make sure you can use all of its services. I believe it will still work partly without the CD though.
Will it connect to more than one device at the same time?,Yes. I had it set to a keyboard and mouse.
Does anyone know if I can use this with two headsets simulatenously? Thanks!,"I tried to connect two separate blue tooth speaker, no joy. Only connects to one at a time. I take it that it would be the same to the headsets."
Is this what I need to install in my hp desktop so I can use a blue tooth speaker?,Yes. Works good.
could I use this device for audio from my tv to a wireless headset,"I'm afraid not, this device is to be used in a PC, desktop or laptop because drivers must be installed, it works without any fault for its intended use."
Does the currently shipping product still include the WinXP drivers on the driver CD? Asking about product received Jan/Feb 2015 or later.,It does. It comes with instructions showing you how to install for Windows XP.
Does this adapters drivers allow for headset/speakerphone functionality? i.e. Can I receive cell phone (iPhone) calls and such on my PC via Bluetooth?,"The adapter sends audio signals from your PC to a Bluetooth enabled device. The device should work with a Bluetooth ear transciever, but will not work with a non-Bluetooth headset or speaker phone."
How is the motor speed consistenc ad longevility? How is the sound quality? How long does it take before it breaks or the sound quality gets affected,"Motor speed was slightly (~3-4%) higher than it should be but at least very steady. Sound quality was OK, even good for portable cassette player. Used it to convert to digital, was able to compensate motor speed and apply very good sound filters in the conversion software, so the resulting sound was very decent, I would even say better than the original. Unfortunately, it broke after a few hours of experiments and converting 5 or 6 cassettes."
Does this require purchasing a separate power cord?,"There is a 3V DC 500mAmp power port, but the transformer does not come with it. I'm using it with rechargeable batteries--no problems so far."
Does this work with MAC ? I have MACBook Pro with OS 10.6.8,"Hi, this item can't support the MAC, it can support with these systems: Microsoft Windows 2000/ XP/ Vista/ Win 7, hope this will help you."
Can this be used to play on a car sterio system Honda Civic 2009?,I don't think so because it works off a USB input that goes into a computer.
does it only covert one song at a time or can i do multiple ones?,One tape obviously but you can copy segments to individual files using the software. I'm very happy with it and have been copying obsolete books on tape to my computer and to DVDs.
Will it wor with windows 7?,Yes this works with windows 7 out of the box
dose this have a speed botin,It has a Fast Forward and Rewind button as well as a Play button.
Is the software compatible with Windows 8?,Yes it is
Will it record an mp3 onto cassette?,it doesn't work at all everything I have tried would not work a waste of money
Does this item work with Apple Mac?,"Dear Customer, Yes, it dose. Best regards, MamBate USA Inc."
Will it work with the iPhone 5,"You will need to buy the 32 pin adaptor for Iphone 5, about u$29, to be able to plug it in the front, or you can always use cable with 3,5mm plug audio input on the back."
Fm radio included?,"yes,FM radio included"
"Does this unit have a ""Repeat All"" function for the CD?","Hi Judith. Yes, but only in Remote Control... not in the main dock! if you press the repeat button one time, all the songs will be repeated after the last track has finished. If you press twice, that song will play forever until you stop it."
What size batteries does the remote require?,"2 AA, they must have come with it because they are a Sony brand"
Will this work with IPods (Classic &amp; 5th Generation)?,Yes it does!!
Will this work with my 3rd generation IPod?,It works with my iPad 2. I have no idea about the 3. I do really like this music system.
Where can I get a remote and instruction booklet?,Both are included within the package
Can I connect it to my tv?,"Well Allein, I haven't really try to do that, but I guess it could be possible since the CMT-V50iP has got a rear port for the standard stereo audio jack. However, I don't think this could provide the sound experience you might be trying to get. The system is good enough to listen music. For TV, get a home theatre otherwise stay with the tv built-in speakers."
does this product work with IPAD 2?,Yes. It does work with iPad 2 and 3. For the latest iPad and iPhone version with the lightning plug however you will need a adaptor which is already available at the apple store.
Where can I buy a power cord,"I'm sorry, Cheryl. I have no idea where you could buy a power cord. I wish I could help, but I can't."
i only have basic cable without the cablebox can i still connect the google box to my tv,If your cable box only has a COAX cable connection to the TV then you can't connect it to the Sony. Its input for Cable or satellite is HDMI only.
Can I plug the power adapter into a 220-240v outlet? Intending to use it outside of US.,"Yes, you can."
"Will it let me watch Amazon Prime movies? The free ones included with Amazon Prime ($79) subscription, or only the rent/buy amazon instant videos?","I truly hate when people provide uninformative, useless answers to questions. YES, it will let you watch Amazon Prime movies, including the free movies and TV shows available from the Amazon Prime subscription: I know, I use it. The built-in Primetime app integrates Netflix and Amazon (and Google Play videos and Redbox and your cable/satellite TV) into one app that is really a pretty nice way to see everything you have available through one app."
Can you send and receive e-mails ?,"Hi Duke10, since the Internet TV has a browser, you may access your email. -Vincent"
Does it work with Hulu or Vulu,Hulu - not directly (can use PlayOn via a PC server). Vudu - yes.
does it work with direct tv,"I have direct tv. I wouldn't use the remote to change the channel. I have my direct tv in my HDMI 1 and my GS7 in my HDMI2 port. So if I want to watch my Netflix, amazon, or M-Go I just hit the input button and switch my tv to HDMI2"
No SIGNAL going into the PLAYER,"Have to manually reset, contact them and they will guide you step by step"
Does Hulu work? is there a hulu app?,"It definitely does not. There is no Hulu or Hulu Plus app in the Google Play store, nor can you access Hulu from the browser. The two companies have yet to reach a content agreement... The negotiations have stretched on for years at this point. This is a well-known and much-discussed drawback to Google TV. As with most consumer electronics, there are workarounds, however. It is possible to enable your Google TV device to play Hulu, but they involve hacking or ""rooting"" the box... Ever heard of ""jail-breaking"" an iPhone? Same concept. Essentially you are altering the base software of the device to get around certain built-in limitations. Doing this voids the warranty and can make downloading updates difficult. It's not an option I'd suggest unless you're a very tech-savvy person with an understanding of Linux."
Can you play youtube on this device?,Yes.
is it compatible with hulu plus,Hulu Plus is not part of the pre loaded packages. Check with Sony support for more information.
will this fit the transformer t100?,I use it for my T300
so it doesn't interfere with the touch screen?,No not at all it works great easy to put on and has withstanded my 3 year old! Love it tablet saver for sure!!.
will this also fit the Asus FT700T?,it doesn't list it
Once on is it easy to take off?,"Harvey, I have never taken if off I LOVE IT and the fact my screen is SO protected!! I am ordering more in case it gets messed up is how much I love and trust it. It is only sticky around the edges and yes pulls off clean and easy!! I WOULD RECOMMEND!!"
One reviewer said keyboard docking is not possible if using this screen protector. I that the case?,it does not interfere with the keyboard docking. The film is thin and it will be placed on the screen itself. The keyboard dock is at the bottom of the tablet.
"What subwoofer would you recommend for this receiver, one that is less than 12 inches tall",I am using a Yahama YSTSW012- 45 watt powered sub woofer. It is 11.25 inches high. It will rattle the walls if you want it too. I had the Yamaha and decided to use it and not get a new one.
Does this receiver put out any real BASS?? I have yet to find one of these so called 'theater systems' that does!!!,"you can adjust the bass&treble by doing a calibration with the auto calibration mike, also you can add a subwoofer which I did"
Can you connect a regular dvd player and regular speakers? How does it connect to the tv? I don't have a smart tv.,yes you can connect regular speakers and a regular DVD player you do not need a smart TV for this
Does this receiver have 3d capabilty?,"I do not have any 3D source to test it but the Sony store website does say the following: 3D pass-through capability allows you to enjoy Blu-ray 3D movies, 3D video games and other 3D content with compatible players and HDTVs."
Can this be installed by someone without vast electrical training?,"Yes and know, adding speakers and perhaps your cable box and a DVD player is not hard (HDMI wires). The more important part is performing the calibration check which does check if you have the speaker wires correctly connected - can take a few tries but if patient, you can do it."
"Does Sony STRDN1030 support ""IPod mini"" (4GB version)? I connected my IPod Mini, OS 1.4.1 to the USB port. The receiver shows ""NO SUPPORT""","I'm sorry but I can not answer your question. However, you can call Sony technical and they should be able to answer your question. Don"
I want to listen to the radio broadcast of a hockey game while viewing it on television. Is this doable? It was on my old Sony system. Thanks.,Well it has AM and FM if that is what your asking. Is the broadcast that your talking about a local FM channel or from a service like Sirius?
"Has anyone had any issues with the receiver going in to protect mode? Running nice new 8ohm speakers for all channels, along with two differently powered subs. All speaker connections checked. If warm or hot (usually is) when turning up past 35 it goes...","Actually, I have never had the need to turn the volume past 15. It gets beyond my tolerance level. The only time I had the need to turn up the volume to 20-25 was when I did not use the auto calibration. The dialogue was too low and the background music got too loud. Finally, I used the supplied microphone to perform auto calibration and now I never have to turn up volume that high. Even at volume levels of 20-25, the receiver never shut down."
Sirius XM on this receiver via the internet built in?,"No, it is not. The limited selection is V-tuner, Slacker, Pandora, Music Unlimited. However, if you have a bluetooth equipped device that plays Sirius, you can stream from it to the receiver."
does this unit support hdmi (arc),Yes. Of course
I want to broadcast music and recorded dialogue that can be heard on fm radios within a block. Need simple plug &amp; play sett up. Will this do it?,"There are a lot of stipulations to an answer but yes, it could conceivably cover a block. The size of the block, the type of setting (urban or suburban), and other singles in the area will determine the range. The listening device will also play a role in distance as well. Just keep in mind that, if you're in the US, the FCC regulates what you can be transmitting and how far. The fines for breaking regulations are hefty and can carry jail time. That says nothing about potential civil lawsuits based on what you're broadcasting. I'm not trying to scare you. I'm just trying to point out that you should do your homework. Triangulating a signal is very easy with the right equipment and you may be attracting more attention than you originally intended."
Can an iPod be hooked up to the transmitter?,"yes. anything with a headphone jack can hook up to it. however, this is a cheep thing and sound quality is inferior."
What do you think the range would be with outside antenna?,"1-1 1/2 miles in urban environment, 2 miles suburban, 3-5 miles open countryside. Make sure to mount the antenna just a little above the roof line of any surrounding buildings to achieve best range"
How's the sound quality?,"Well, Nick, contrary to what the other reviews indicate, the sound quality CAN be very good - IF it is set up properly. I also had a Ham license, I'm an electrical design engineer, a music buff, and have been involved with audio, video and RF design for several decades. I can see where there would be ""issues"" with sound quality if there are any shortcomings in the connections, cables, layout, impedance matching, antenna setup, audio source accuracy, etc. etc. This is not a toy, but it can act like one because it's basically sold as a ""plug-and-play"" device. If you use the supplied whip antenna and plug in an iPod for a music source (like many people would probably do), it will be horrible. You will get RF feedback which will add distortion, hum and all kinds of other nasty stuff to the final signal. On the other hand, if you understand and follow proper RF layout procedures, and keep the RF away from the audio and power inputs, use a proper 50-ohm antenna with a matching feedline, your results will be indistinguishable from the next radio station on the dial. Unlike previous reviewers, I HAVE tested this with professional equipment, and the test results are well worth the price of the unit. I listen to my little ""station"" through a very sophisticated and expensive audio system and it sounds great - and I'm very fussy about sound quality. Bottom line: It's only as good as the quality of the installation."
What cain of antenna do i need to transmit in SW(shortwave)?,"Your question makes no sense for this item, and I don't know what you mean by ""cain""... Is it ""kind""? Is it ""gain? First of all, this is an FM broadcast band transmitter - it's not even close to shortwave. Shortwave radio covers an entirely different range of frequencies, and is mostly AM (not FM). The antenna depends more on the frequency, not the transmitter. Secondly, if you don't know these basics, you should not be buying anything like this."
"Can the supplied antenna be removed, and an external antenna attached? If so, what sort of connector is on this to attach the antenna to?",A BNC connector on the back allows any 50 ohm antenna to connect.
Does this have Pre-Emphasis settings? I need 75 &#x265;s setting,No signal adjustments at all except for transmission frequency and high and low power.
"Since this xmitter has the FCC Part 15 Certification stamped on it, why would it be illegal as other comments have suggested?","If you go to the FCC site (FCC Application number 686762), the type approval number, 2ABT5AX05B7C, on 23 January 2015, was withdrawn by Delia W. See https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/ViewExhibitReport.cfm?mode=Exhibits&RequestTimeout=500&calledFromFrame=N&application_id=686762&fcc_id=2ABT5AX05B7C The interior pictures with the filing appear to have been from an earlier version. i.e. The label is for a different model that is similar in appearance. Finding the type approval application is difficult as the withdrawal makes searching on the type approval number impossible. Use the application number instead. Too bad, it was a really nice product."
What Microphones works well with this unit? I tried dynamic but plug is touchy 6.5mm. Condenser mics didn't work. Recommendations?,"use a microphone with a stereo jack, like one used for a computer. my unit grounds out when using the mic jack."
Could you put a 50 watt CB amplifier on this? Would it work?,CB frequencies are 27 megahertz. FM radio works between 88 and 108Mhz. the amplifier would be so far out of its operating band Itwould not function
Can I plug this into my PC and stream video to my PC screen? Thanks,"While I would like to say yes, the laggy wireless prevents streaming."
can you watch youtube videos on this thing???,It did not even work out of the box.. Waste of money and shipping takes for ever... Save your money and buy a Google Chrome cast works perfectly
What app store is this device using?,I installed the Google play store no problem. You may have to do it from. All but easy to get with installed browser.
does this work with touch screen?,"i would personally not buy this ..as mine did not work when I finally got it after 3 1/2 weeks, I would buy from a different seller or even get a different product.."
Can it access a thumb drive via USB hub and mount as a read/write volume in Android?,Yes.
Is there a way to run a Minecraft server instance on this device?,"In theory, you can, but I will take some work. You would need to switch it to running Linux, then recompile the Minecraft stuff to work on ARM instead of x86. That requires the source code, which I'm unsure is available."
Can I plug a camera and use Skype or any other video phone services?,I did see the camera software from Android 4.0 is in the software still but I am not sure if it will work with a USB Cam or not but if it does Skype should work with it. though I did not test it I just checked and the Play store says Skype is compatible with SoftwinerEvb ( MK802 )
I am thinking of using this as a portable PowerPoint player. Is there any reason it won't work for that?,"PowerPoint is Microsoft's IP. Android is Google's. Msft doesn't play nicely with Google, but the inverse isn't true. You can probably make it work, but just be wary it won't be like having a mini Windows"
Im not sure how to use this device. What is it for?,"It is a computer which uses android OS. If you attach it to a TV or monitor which has an HDMI connector and plug a mouse into the USB port, you can search the internet and download android apps."
How do I find out how many programs are running and how to stop them?,like all android with left click
What is the actual memory 512 or 1gb?,"There are two version the older original was 512, the newer is 1GB. Yoou should be getting the newer version when you order here now."
Do you need WIFI to use this to miracast from android?,You can upload content on the micro SD card slot that is available and play it while connected via USB. Otherwise you'll need a wifi connection for other streaming functions
Can I plug a camera and use Skype or any other video phone services?,"Yeah, you should just try to find a webcam that claims to be Android compatible if you can find it, and just do some research online to find one that suits your needs. There are people that use this with webcam and mouse/keyboard, and even a DVD drive like a full computer. Best of luck!"
my remote does not seem to be working - maybe the battery is discharged. How do I charge it?,on the inside of the battery case is a little chip that goes on the mini PC that works fine for me because the remote uses triple A batteries or something
"Are there any on-board sensors - accelerometers, etc?",No
I am having problems with Apps shutting down on their own..streaming video. Any thoughts?,I would delete all wifi connections and start our fresh. Make sure you're getting good signal while streaming.
Can this mirror any app that is currently active on my Android phone screen?,Yes
"Does it have, or can be installed any browser, like Google Chrome, or FireFox?","It has a browser, but you can install Firefox or Chrome."
"Does it have or can be installed a browser, like Google Chrome, or FireFox?",Yes?
"can i connect this to my android with data connection, not wifi. also, can i use this device to screen mirror?","If you mean ""use your mobile as a tether"", I don't see why you couldn't, as all android devices can tether, although the older phones need to be rooted. As for screen mirroring, I would suggest getting a HDMI splitter (multi HDMI hub) to connect more than one screen, though I don't think the mini PC has more than one screen, unless you can find or create an app for that. Also, if your mobile has a Sim card, you can buy a Sim card USB reader and that would allow the use of data directly on the mini PC."
just recieved item. but no directions for where to make connections. like where does what wires go?,See my review of this amp kit on Amazon. If it does not answer your questions then get back to me.
What kind of options for a housing are there? I searched online and didn't see anything. I'm not extremely handy with fabrication. Thanks so much!,I used a wood box from a hobby store. I just placed the base side up. I also put in an off/on toggle switch.
is this fully assembled ready to use,"Mostly! You need to wire up the two legs of the included power supply transformer - the two blue wires go to the 120v terminals of the device, and the two white wires go to the 6.3volt terminals of the device. You also need to wire a power cord to the other end of the trafo, the two red wires combine to the positive terminal wire (2 reds to white) and the two blacks to negative terminal (2 blacks to black) That's about it. It's also a good idea to either set up a proper enclosure, or at least mount the standoffs to a small board. Also, I highly recommend upgrading the stock no name Chinese tubes to GE Jan 5670w tubes - the stock tubes sound okay, but the little pre gets very pretty sounding with a good set of vintage tubes. You should be able to score a pair for around ten or fifteen bucks shipped via fleabay or the like. Note - this is a preamp - it doesn't make things super loud, and it won't drive anything by itself, but if you want to be able to put this between a source you want to get warm spacious tone from, say a turntable or ipod, and your regular stereo or power amp, this is a steal! Link is to photos of mine for context. https://www.dropbox.com/sc/ty97l22jf4rsrqf/AADETFc_i4qONVVuUan-L9EYa"
"My transformer only has one pair of blue wires, one pair of white and one pair of red. There are no black wires. Any tips on how to wire this for 110V","Red is the 120v AC side(input) The white wires is 6.3v AC (heaters) and the blue wires are 170v AC for the tubes.. White wires go into the 6.3v terminals, and the blue wires go into the 170v terminals."
"IPlease, can you tell where is the headphone plug and the impedance of this amplifier?",There is no headphone jack that comes with the unit. You can buy a rca to 3.5 mm adapter from Amazon and plug it in to the output rca jacks. That is how I got mine to work. But even with low impedance headphones the volume is not all that loud. You would be better off with a headphone amp. http://www.amazon.com/3-5mm-Stereo-Female-Y-Cable-6-Inch/dp/B000I23TTE/ref=sr_1_6?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1381934676&sr=1-6&keywords=rca+to+3.5+mm+female+cable
Do i need to buy a 3 prong or 2 prong power cord?,"If I recall correctly, three prong - there is a ground wire"
I assembled mine as per the directions from other purchasers. A DMM tells me I'm only getting 93V @ the blue wires and 3.4V @ the whites. What's wrong,It sounds like you have the MAINS of the transformer series instead of parallel.. OR you have the 240V version by mistake?
this work as a phono pre amp ? will it work for my turntable ?,No
frequency responce? Total harmonic distortion? Input sensitivity? Signal to noise ratio? Output level?,"Unfortunately, these come with almost no documentation about the various specifications of the unit. Mine didn't even come with a wiring diagram for the transformer. Because of all this, I dont actually have any of this information, but i can tell you that its easy to connect the transformer and its a nice sounding preamp with low noise and a wide frequency response and its well worth the money."
What is difference between this and the IHBS112-04,The IHBS112-04 will burn (record to) both DVD and Blu-Ray disks. The IHES112-04 will only read Blu-Ray disks (and burn DVD disks).
Where is the software,"There is no software, just this drive. You have to download and purchase software to play Blu-Ray on your PC. The software I chose to purchase is: ""Aiseesoft Blu-ray Player"". You can Google for that; it works well on my Living Room PC: Windows XP Professional, 3-Ghz CPU, 3-gigs of RAM."
Does this come with a SATA cable? What is the length?,I don't remember it coming with a SATA cable... and if for some reason it did they are usually 9inches - 12 inches.
Does this drive play standard DVDs as well or only blu ray?,"Yes, it will play DVDs or CDs as well."
does it writes?,"It burns/writes CD's and DVD's, but does NOT burn blu-rays"
Does the drive comes with cables?,Mine didn't come with any
Need Advice: This Card or the EVGA GeForce GTX670 FTW?,I would opt for the msi card especially if you plan on overclocking. The triple over voltage of the msi card will give you higher stable overclocks. It also runs extremely silent compared to the evga blower style cooling system. Just my two cents :).
"Would this Graphics Card Work Well With An ACER ""Predator"" G3620, with an Intel i7 - 3770 @ 3.4 GHz Proccessor, 10 GB RAM, and Windows 8.1?","Yes sir it sure will, the only concern I had with fitting the msi gtx 670 in that particular rig was the length of the card but that case can fit up to a gtx 680 in it. It would be a solid upgrade for that system as you already have a great cpu and plenty of ram. The only other upgrade I could recommend is an ssd but a gtx 670 is a great addition to what you currently have!"
Is this video card a significant improvement from a GTX 630?,"Yes. You can always google something like ""gtx 630 vs 670"" to get specs & stats differences, but the short version is that this is a significant upgrade over the 630. I've been very happy with it for over a year now; plays everything at 1080p maxed out with good frame rates that I've ever tried. Would recommend."
do i get an international warranty with this card.. ?,"The best information I can supply you with is , yes they have a global warranty and here is the link to it www.msi.com/service/warranty/. If they honor it is another question that I don't know. Hope I helped!"
does it support new gen i7?,"Not sure, I do know this board has TONS of problems, way beyond Firmware. I have been a huge EVGA fan for many years, but this board changed all that. I would not consider this board at all. I returned the one I ordered and installed after having multiple severe problems. One problem was almost none of the USB ports worked, and the ones that did were flakey. These problems were not minor and if you read through user reviews you will see similar complaints. I ended up ordering and installing this board which has worked flawlessly (see link). I have an Intel i7-3930K with a single GTX690 in it and it's a fantatic gaming rig. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0064L8UJM/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&psc=1"

Is there anybody that has the owners manual or somewhere I candownload for a craig sound bar model#cht912,I believe I do still have my manual. I'd be glad to look for it and scan it for you. I would just need to know how to email it to you.
"I see the dimensiosn are 2.5 x 37 x 4 inches. Is it 2.5"" high or 4"" high? I need 3"" high or less to fit between my refrigerator and cabinet.","It is 4"" high - This will most likely not fit into a space smaller than 4-5 inches high."
Does this sound bar have a digital optical in or output?,"No it doesn't, it comes AV,Line and bluetooth..."
i bought this to hook up to a samsung tv couldn't get anything to work - any suggestions?,Unless your tv has the old audio out jacks (red white av) you have to plug it into your cable box or DVD player. I had the same problem and I had to plug it into my cable box audio out jacks. Most newer tv's don't have those jacks anymore. They have the optical audio out jack which I'm not sure this sound bar has. Hope that helps.
How tall is it?,About 3 to 4 ft.
Can I connect my Galaxy s4 to this unit?,"With an aux cable, yes"
can this speaker be plugged into an electrical outlet,Yes
does it support iphone 5,You have to use tbe 3.5mm cord to you it but yes it does. I returned it because the speakers rattled a lot and I was not happy with this unit.

4 or 5 Speakers?,4 high powered speaker . Great tower!
Can I use my ipod classic on this tower?,"You should be able to I think, this tower has the apple 32 pin connector not the lightening connector, so I do believe it should work for you"
Can I hook up a subwoofer &amp; ipod classic to it?,"IPod classic can connect, but a subwoofer will not"
I assume I can plug this to a TV via audio jack....can I still use the TV remote to control the volume?,"Yes you can, but I prefer the sound when I keep the TV volume about mid-range and adjust the volume with the tower remote."
will this camera take presset cruise points to go to multiple designated locations or it only moves from left to right also is it pelco d rs485 compatible and could you provide me the manual.,"128 presets, 5 automatic programmable tour which can store 16 presets, home place. RS485 control bus. Look here(http://kb.zmodo.com/category.php?id=46), it comes with a printed manual also."
"Can this camera be used with a Zmodo 720P HD 4CH PoE NVR Model ZP-NC14-P, with 4 ea ZP-IBH13-P cameras. Can I use one slot for this PTZ?",call 866-6881 for all zmodo question they have all the answers.
Will it work with a Defender system? How many feet of cable do you get for the power supply? Do you get a power supply? Any RS485 cable come with it?,It comes with a power supply but not cable.
Can I mount this camera on a light pole.,Yes you can.
will zmodo CM-Z2213GY camera work with q-see dvr?,I do not know.
how much warranty on them,"a year, but for some issues they make exceptions"
Tilt question (rephrased) With the camera mounted 8 foot high - Can you zoom in on the head of a 6 foot man standing 200 foot away?,"I dont see why not. The camera has pretty good zoom capability, but would likely serve better a bit higher up than 8 feet. The camera itself is a bit larger than you might expect from pictures."
what is the tilt range of this camera,Not very good. Down but not straight down. And up but not straight up. I don't know the exact range though. Sorry
Does this 420TVL have a microphone/audio connection?,No it does not
will camera work with a joystick controller,Yes. Any RS485 controller should work
Is it practical to use this watch as your everyday watch (in addition to your running watch)? Is it big/bulky? Rugged enough?,It's perfectly fine for an everyday watch and has great battery life (over a year) when not in GPS mode. It's not super stylish as it's a sports watch but it can definitely do the trick for both running and daily use.
I only want to register distance hiked. Can you give me simple instructions to do that?,"Well if you are like me you keep experimenting until you figure out what works. There are lots of options, lots of screens, so it can be confusing. But the GPS workout screen is the second screen of the four main screens. Use the mode button to get to the second screen. On the second screen press and hold the Lap/Reset button to activate the GPS then before you take another step press the Start/Stop button. Start hiking now. When you finish press the Start/Stop button and hold down the Lap/Reset button to turn off the GPS. Don't get in the car and drive away without turning your GPS off or your are going to mess up your data when you download the data from you watch. You can see your distance as you hike and you can also see it on the map when you download your data to the runtastic website. That's what works for me, hope it helps."
Does this chest strap work with the Runtastic Road bike iPhone app?,Not. It doesn't. To work with IPhone you need the Runtastic Bluetooth chest Strap
Does the chestband work with other gym equipment to measure heart rate?,Hi Keith - this chestband does not but the Runtastic Heart Rate Combo Monitor does.
Does the watch record splits,It does record laps and splits.
"Hi, does anybody know if you can use this indoors on a Tread Mill....I can't find a thing about it anywhere?","There is no reason why you could not. You can turn off the GPS and run as stand alone heart rate monitor. The tread mill should give your distance/pace, ect and you would than manually enter that info in to your Runtastic activity profile with the ""manual edit"" feature online once you had synced the watch and uploaded that specific activity."
Is this waterproof for swimming?,No. It isn't.
Is it possible to buy a replacement USB cable for this watch? The connection with my current one is very spotty. Thanks for any advice.,"I may be wrong, but I'd think, only if someone is selling theirs on ebay or on here. Otherwise, you'd need to purchase the entire package again. Call or email Runtastic customer service. They'll be able to answer that more accurately."
Where can I buy an extra charging cable. I've exchanged emails with the company several times but the link they've provided doesn't work.,Try Ebay
"are there any audible alerts from the watch, such as mileage or pace, or even an audible tone for a set interval?","I set my heart rate range and it beeps when I am not in that range, I don't remember how I did it though, the instructions were a bit confusing at first and now it's just set to go."
"Hi, will this work with a r9 290x Gigabyte Windforce? Also how many slots does this take up? I have four PCIe x16 slots. I have 2 r9 290x and a PCIe 4x SSD card that fits in a x16 slot. I want to make sure they will all fit in my motherboard. Thanks.","Would need to know the make of your motherboard first, since that is the base for spacing issues. But as for how many slots it will take up, if you use the back plate radiator it will take up two slots. But yes it is rated for that card."
"anyone put this on gtx 760 ? how well did it work and how hard was it to put on. i have put h80i CORSAIR on already, will this be harder? thanks-",Put it on my gtx 780 works fine. Not as well as a full cooling system. But keeps my graphics card from overheating like it did before I put this on. Before installing this I could only play games in 4k for about an hour before my pc would crash from overheating. After installing it never overheats. Keeps at a comfortable 65 Celsius. Also was relatively simple to install and comes with full instructions.
Would it fit to my 2 x EVGA GTX660 Superclocked? Thinking about buying 2 kits for them,"Honestly, I don't know. I had problems fitting the graphics card in the first PCI-E 16x slot due to the RAM modules. Look at this video, it might help with your question: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXbgyGLgAqk"
What are people doing to cool their VRAM chips? I am using heat sinks but they still get pretty hot.,fans directed right at the chips (bottom) and heat sink (top)
How is this powered? SATA connection?,The fan is powered by your graphics card (when you unplug the fan on your card you plug it in there) and the pump is powered by molex.
Does it leave room for installing a liquid cpu cooling system?,"I guess that depends on your case, I have a similar closed loop water cooler on my cpu also, so yes. But getting both radiators installed in my case took a little ingenuity."
Is possible to install this without the back heat sink and without modding it (loosing warranty)?,No
can the tubing be modded to a larger radiator for better cooling?,"Hi, its not recommended to change the radiator. The cooling capacity should be enough for any graphics card. Best regards, Jens"
will it work with my pc?,"For the most part yes it will. If your going to be using a lot of the Function Keys, then I would get another keyboard. There is no F12 key, which has been a pain for me."
Does this have a power key that will power on the Chromebox? Anyone know if the Chromebox can be powered on by any keyboard?,No and no
Can this be used with a Mac Mini running chrome,I have this keyboard. But i've only used it with the Samsung Chromebox.
will it work with windows,Yes it will Ron. The short cut keys just act as the function keys
Will this work with the Samsung Chromebook?,"Since it's just a usb keyboard, yes it should work. in fact, any usb keyboard should work with the chromebook; wired or wireless."
Is this an official samsung chrome keyboard for chromebox? Why no pictures and listing looks kind of fishy?,it looks pretty legit considering there aren't any photos for it on samsung's official website either other than the small photo from the front.
Will this work with the new Asus chromebox?,I have the google chromebox and it works great. Dont see why it wouldn't work.
Can I connect my TV audio to this ?,"Yes. Buy/use a Y connecting cable & plug it into your audio out (usually 2 RCA plugs probably on the back of your TV) The other end of your cable should be a mini, into the mini ""in"" of your Altec Lansing M650. You can find this connecting cable at Amazon.com. Now all you have to do is sit back and listen."
why does the photo show an Iphone docked in it but one person said they couldn't dock their Iphone or Ipod into it?,"Because later model iPods/iPhones and iOS versions have shown compatibility problems. I connect mine via aux input to airport streaming audio from iTunes/computer. If you want to play audio directly from dock, you may have problems"
will iphone 6 work ?,Hi its a 30 pin so it won't naturally . its possible it will work with an adapter but i'm not sure.
Will this handle the iphone 6,For charging you will need an dock to lightning adapter but for just playing audio it will work.
Can I dock my iPhone 5S on this?,Yes. That's what I have.
Is this compatible for an iPhone 4S?,It's compatible with the larger (old style) charging plug. You can still use it w the new smaller plug but needs to run thru the earphone plug on the phone.
is this iphone 4s compatable?,"Hi, yes is compatable whit all models of apple ipod and iphone,"
does it have universal voltage (110 - 250 volts)?,"Yes it have . Input 100-240V ~ 50-60Hz 1200mA , output 17V 2300mA . But it is not includes audio jack 3.5mm so you must be buy it separate"
how can i turn down the bass?,It is easy . Press and hold your bass button and at the same time press the - button which is three buttons to the left of the bass button on top of the unit. Repeated presses of the - button will lower the bass more. Good luck
does this dock work as a charger for the iphone?,"yes it does, but i did return this item sound quality was excellent for the price , but just not as good as i wanted. bought a bose instead"
Are you glad you got the black one? I am trying to decide between this &amp; the white one. It is for possibly displaying crochet items to sell on etsy.,"I love the black one! Very elegant looking and goes great in my shop! However, I bought an iron one for my crochet items I have."

Do you ship in Greece?,"follow the item when it is available in prime, amazon prime might have options to ship it to Greece."
Do you have this in tan?,Not tan but i do have it in white.
"I have the vista 20P for a main panel and my sensors are wireless,is this compatible as a replacement panel?",Yes...it is...I did exactly the same thing.
do they make a touch panel that has Spanish voice,I don't see anywhere I. The manual or settings that allows for other languages... I'm sorry
is this 4G,It is compatible with a 4g GSM.
Can I use this with a GSM SIM without paying for monthly? Cab I set it up to directly call my cell like other systems?,I had that setup in mind when I purchased the system but you will need an account to take advantage of all the featues. My installer said it was not possible.
do you need the monitoring service to access it remotely?,Yes. You will need to install a WiFi or GSM card and a Zwave card if you want automation. Alarm grid has a plan that is $10 for self monitoring and $10 for automation access. These are per month fees. Much more reasonable compared to the more major security companies.
What is the model number of the module to make this system work on cellular?,Honeywell 5800C2W Hardwired to 5800 Wireless Converter
what are the differences between the honeywell L5100 and L5200,Different screen and buttons and the 5200 has the zwave module built in. There are many other differences but these are the main ones.

Does this control panel come with battery and transformer?,Yes
Can this panel replace a Westec 5000 control panel with wired sensors,No
Does the head of the tripod lock in a vertical position?,"Yes. There is a plastic ""thumb screw"" at the top, just above the large ""turn handle"". Turn it counterclockwise to loosen it, then rotate the head up to a vertical position and tighten the ""thumb screw"" to hold it in place."
Is the quick release system Manfrotto compatable?,No it's very plastic
can i use this tripod with a jvc gz-ex310 camcorder,"While I can't speak specifically to this model, if it has the standard tripod plate screw hole in the bottom, this will work. The bigger problem is that that tripod is garbage. You get what you pay for. Cheap plastic, gets extremely brittle in the cold, and the threading that holds the head on cracked the first time I used it, and the camera almost fell off. If you value your gear, invest in something slightly more expensive (I have a ProMaster that I adore that I got at a local camera shop for less than $90) and save yourself a world of headaches."
Will this work with a Canon SD1000 camera?,yes
Can I remove the head if I want to install a pistol-grip head I already own?,"No, you can't. Also, the quality of this product is not so good. One of the legs of my tripod has broken in less than a month of light use."
"I love this product it holds just as it says it would, it's great, on the other hand how do I remove my device without damaging the case - Help!","Grip the device and the cover, one in each hand, very firmly and pull from a corner very slowly."
"HELP!My red adhesive pad came with instructions. I don't understand them: ""Peel off this mask. AFTER application completed. Wait 15 min for adhesion""",You're basically peeling off the thin film that's on top of the glue section. You give it about 15 minutes for the glue to stick to the backside of your tablet.
Has any one installed/reviewed the screen protector?,The screen protector did not fit either of my tablets. The case is great though. I bought two for myself and one for a friend. I really like the edges being bare/free. I have my tables in soft silicone cases then I attached them to the adhesive. The adhesive is really strong; it may tear the leather when your try to remove the tablet. The silicone cases still stick very well and can be removed with no damage.
"My speaker is on the reverse side If I stick the tablet to the case, how will this affect sound?","I'm not too sure. It may dampen the sound. On my Excite, the speakers are on the bottom in landscape mode and not on the back, so speakers are not blocked. If your speakers are on the back, you may want to skip this case."
how do i attach my tablet? i am so confused! is there a youtube video or anything?,it was difficult for me too then my teenager walked in and slowly peeled off the red rectangle and set the fire on the sticky part underneath! it holds hard but can be removed if you want to change it out later but I like my pink cover :)
will it work for most any 7inch tablet?,"I would say use it would, I have a Google Nexus 7. There is a sticky place for the tablet so it doesn't have to cover any part of the tablet. And the sticky part is really sticky, it doesn't fall out of the cover. I really like this style as it can be set up landscape or portrait. I hope that helps."
will this case fits the kindle fire 2 nd generation?,If its the same size as 1st kindle which is 7 inch yes
"Can this item fit the Samsung Tab 3 7""",It fit my Kindle l HD very well. I Like it.
Will this case fit a Pipo U1 Pro Android Tablet? dimensions of tablet are W*D*H: 197.5*116.6*11.5mm Any help would be much appreciated.,I only know it fits all 7 inch tablets. It fits my D2 Android Pad with 7 inch screen. Hope this helps.
Will this fit most 7 inch tablets ?,"I think it would fit the Kindle Fire, but not the Fire HD - if you look at the specs here: http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Keyboard-Free-Wi-Fi-Display/dp/B004HZYA6E/ref=tag_dpp_lp_edpp_ttl_in my Kindle Keyboard fits *perfectly* with no room to spare. Hope that helps!"
"Bought this in August and it worked fine. Five months later it is dead. It has an 18 month warranty, so how do I request a replacement?",I have the same problem and would like to know as we'll.
"I plugged the battery into my laptop but it didn't work. I need to replace my VGP-BPS13B battery, the one i received have an A at the end.","Sometimes, these generic batteries don't hold much charge. Have you contacted the person you bought it from?"
I have Sony Vaio - MODEL pcg-61411l 19.5v - Please advise if this battery would work for my laptop.,I am sorry I can not say. I can only say it does work on my Model pcg-7184L 19.5v.
will I need a new charger to go with this battery ?,No. The original works.
Can I used to model VGP-BPS13A/Q?,I do not recomend this battery. It didn't work for my Vaio computer and I had to return it to Amazon. Keep away from this battery!
Will this work with a Canon 6d w/ Magic Lantern?,Not sure about a 6D. I bought one for a t3i and it does not work. From everything I have read it only really works for the t2i.
Will this work with the Canon T3?,It will onlyy work with magic lantern software on your t3. Without magic lantern it will just turn off your view finder.
"Will this work with the canon T5i? If not, which cable do you recommend?",yes it will
Will this work with the 70D?,I believe it will as long as you are using the magic lantern software. But I can't be entirely sure. But I can tell you for certain that if you're not using the magic lantern software it wont work. The software is what changes the setting to allow audio via the port.
will this work with nikon d5100,http://www.sescom.com/attachments/manuals/sescomdslrcablescompatibilitychart.pdf
do you have to have magic lantern installed,Yes I do.
"Hello, I'm looking to buy this for my T3i (600D) with magic lantern, but have one question I'm hoping you can answer. When this cable is plugged in to the camera, does the camera's monitor turn off? Thanks ahead of time for your response.",The screen does go black. It only works for the t2i. I does not work for my t4i. Dont waist your money.
What is the range of the device?,"I just tested it out at 85 feet, thru 2 interior and 2 exterior house walls, and it worked fine."
How does sensor work-just barrier being broken or does patient wear sensor,"If barrier is broken the sensor the pager will make a very loud sound. As there was no adjustment for sound control, we always placed the pager in another room. Trust me, you will hear the sound. This device was a life saver for the family as caregivers for our father. I daresay it prevented many falls and broken bones."
Does this have a narrow enough field of view to be used to monitor a front door without triggering whenever someone was walking around in the room?,You'd have to play with it to get it adjusted properly for that application. Perhaps you could aim it at the top of the door so people walking around went under the beam. The beam isn't particularly narrow but the edges are fairly sharp so it's possible (I think).
how does the polarity look on the adaptor?,The motion sensor has a wide of motion that captures at the high and low range of motion. I keep it tilted a little high because I only need to know when my mother sits up.
"Can this be used to monitor if a door is opened? I am thinking about using it for my stepmother's mobile home, with the next door neighbor having the","I have it on a wall and angled facing a door, i dont know if its the door or the person moving that sets the alarm off but it works"
0 Is there a way to silence the pager (On/Off switch?). Is it necessary to remove batteries to silence it?,the pager can be turned off
Is there a way to shut off the sensor when the care givers are walking back and forth to her bed so that it isn't beeping every time someone walks by?,No you have to turn it off or remove the batteries
"I have ordered one of these for my mother, but my sister is wondering whether it will interfere with her pacemaker. Anyone know?",No
Can you program this device into the Smart Caregiver 433 Central monitoring unit?,"I'm going to say no, but I could be wrong. It's a very simple system, and exhibits no capability, that I've read about or otherwise discerned, beyond a basic motion detector/transmitter that's factory radio-paired to a basic beeper. The only electrical connection is a jack in the transmitter for an optional AC power cord. The instructions discuss only getting power to the two units (battery), transmitter placement, and that's about it. Works wonderfully and as advertised, just isn't a scalable system."
Can you buy an additional sensor to have in a second room?,"If you purchase two of these units that broadcast the signal on the same frequency then yes, both sensors would send a signal to the remote the care giver is wearing. However, the care giver would not be able to determine from which room the signal was sent without checking each room."
will this stick to an otter box for a note 3,I'm not sure.... Depends on which model of otterbox you have. If the back has ridges it may still work. I use mine on a leather case from piel frama. Have also used them on silicone and plastic cases and they worked great.
What kind of plastic is it made of?,"Honestly, I don't know. You can go to www.slinggrip.com and contact them for specifics. I can tell you that I am so happy I bought it. It has helped me tremedously with my fumble fingers and makes it easier to watch video, take pictures and maneuver around my apps. Here are their FAQ's: Will SlingGRIP work on my phone? - Yes! If your phone has 2.5 inches of relatively flat space on the back, then yes, SlingGRIP will work without issue. There are a couple of unusual phones that don't have room due a 3D camera or an opening for the battery cover, so if you're in doubt, measure. But most likely the answer is yes. If, for any reason, you find that SlingGRIP is incompatible with your phone, you can return it for a full refund within 30 days. Is it easy to attach? - Yes Its as easy as clean, peel, and stick. Simply wipe off the back of your phone so that there isn't any dirt or grease, peel the backing paper off of the SlingGRIP tape, and press it on. You do want to be careful that you place it in the best spot for you. Usually that best spot is a little lower than center on the back of the phone. Before attaching SlingGRIP, slide your middle finger under the strap and hold it to the back of your phone. How does it feel? Note where it feels best before attaching. Orient it so that the strap runs top to bottom of your phone, not across it. Some people like to place it an angle, though that may not make it as comfortable to use from both sides. We recommend straight up and down for the most comfortable grip. Remember, the elastic is flexible enough to easily turn your phone 90 degrees. Can I use SlingGRIP on my Nook or Kindle? - YesIf you like to read on an e-reader but find that your hand is cramping up before you finish a chapter, you'll love SlingGRIP. It lets you easily hold a tablet up when reading in bed or laying back. And you won't drop the thing on your face when you fall asleep. How do I sell SlingGRIP in my store? - EasyWe welcome the opportunity to work with new stores just about anywhere. Give us a call and we'll help you get the best products for your store. Where are SlingGRIP products sold? - SlingGRIP can be found in dozens of stores around the world. Check out our STORE LOCATOR to find one near you. You can avoid shipping and waiting by purchaging from a store near you! We support local, independently owned stores and hope that you will too. Where is SlingGRIP made? - Sling Products are micro-manufactured in Minnesota, USA. The many benefits of local and low-impact manufacturing are cornerstones of our company. Keeping our manufacturing in the USA, and within an hour's drive from our headquarters, allows us to verify that our quality control standards are met, thereby allowing us to deliver you the most perfect product possible. How long does it take to ship? - Once you've placed an order on our site it will be in the mail within 24 hours! SlingGRIPs ordered within the continental US will be sent via USPS unless other arrangements are made. Delivery is typically 2-7 days. If for some reason you do not receive your SlingGRIP as quickly as you had expected, please don't hesitate to get in touch with us at - beth@slinggrip.com. How do I remove it if I need to? - You can remove a SlingGRIP by pulling very slowly from one end of the strap. Do not pull too fast you risk pulling the back off your phone or damaging the grip. It can help to pry it off slowly with a dull butter knife. Once it is removed, if there is any remaining adhesive on either the phone or the SlingGRIP, it can be removed by rolling it with your thumb until it balls up and can be pulled off. An alcohol wipe can remove any remaining adhesive. SLING GRIP WILL NOT DAMAGE YOUR PHONE!! Do you share my information? - Never. Your personal information will remain safe and secure with us. We'll never distribute your information to any other organization. Can I get customized or branded phone grips? - Yes! We print full color logos and artwork on the elastic to create awesome phone accessories. The SlingGRIP is perfect for next promotion or give-away and we can connect you with one of our distributors near you. The SlingGrip is a great phone accessory that fits iPhone, Samsung Galaxy, Android, iPad, Kindle, or any Case (except silicone)."
I have a Sony Vaio Tap 11. It's an 11.6 inch tablet weighing 1.7 lbs. Could I use one of these (or 2 or 3 next to one another) on something that big?,I use 2 of them on my note 3. Works wonderfully. Can't live without them.
"I have the thing sling for the Samsung Note 2 and it was awesome. However, it doesn't stick to the faux leather Note 3 case cover. Solutions?","I use 2 of them on my piel frama case for galaxy note 3, they work great side by side. It is leather, so that might make a difference. Try cleaning area with some peroxide first. That may help."
"Hi, will this work with Nikon D3200?","It works on a D5100 so, unless Nikon did something stupid, I imagine it would work on the 3200 as well."
How about batteries type and life?,They seem to last
Will this work with Canon EOS Rebel T1i?,Not sure. I use it on a D 5100 Nikon
Will this work with a Canon 60D?,"Hi, JSV. Sorry, I use a Nikon D7000."
There is no picture when I connect...just sound. Advice?,"You can try relaunching the iPad application (Netflix, whatever) - have sometimes had to disconnect and reconnect cable to get working but always did. Oh it won't work with Amazon Prime Video! They block it!"
Does it work with IOS 8 o superior??? Thanks,Yes. My iPad 2nd generation is running iOS 8.2
Can I use this cable to connect iPads to a projector that has HDMI input.,"Yes, If you also buy a HDMI cable.This is only adapts the iPad output to HDMI. You would plug the HDMI cable into this."
any issues with IOS 7?,"Good and timely question. I just tested my iPhone 4S running iOS 7 and ported Netflix video and sound to my 24"" monitor without issue. Did need to remove the iPhone from its Belkin silicone bumper shell to get a solid connection with the 30-pin plug. This adapter is definitely in my travel bag."
does this work with an ipad mini?,If you have a 30 pin to lightning adapter.
Does this work with an apple lightening port?,"No, this is for 4 and 4s."
Where can I find one that works with iPad 4th Gen.?,Amazon does sell a lightning digital AV adapter....I believe it came from Apple. I bought one several months ago for husband's 4th gen and it works great.
Is this compatible with ios 6.1.3 on iPhone 4s?,Hardware wise it is compatible with older iPhones software I am not sure because I do not run software that old. If it doesn't work update your software and you should be fine. Ask the seller their policy about returns before buying if you want to know for sure. This way if they are pretty return friendly than it would be worth the process.
"Someone said that this doesn't work with Amazon Prime. Is that true? What do I need to stream Amazon Prime, Netflix, HBO etc.","I know it works with anything I can get on my iPad. I've streamed content on my little iPad and with the cable connected to my big screen TV, seen the same content enlarged to fill the TV screen, or nearly so. I can't speak to the Amazon Prime and HBO content. Seems to me if you are getting it on an iPad, it should also appear on your TV."
Will this work with iOS 8.1.3?,It works fine for everything except our Cablevision and this is because our provider has the iPad blocked.
Is this microphone compatible with the Aiptek 1080P High Definition Digital Camcorder w/5x optical zoom?,"Yes, but to be honest the quality of sound isn't really any different than the mic on the camera. If you're going to buy a shotgun boom I would shell out a little more for something better."
I own this microphone but want to know if anyone else is getting Radio Transmissions from Radio Stations in your mic input?,Yes the shielding on it sucks I don't use the mic any more. You can try and use a better XLR for it it helps a little
"I have it right now, and I was wondering what can I do to stop the hissing that comes with this mic?",I have the same issue and honestly feel that it's a piece of junk with no solution here. Maybe someone else has an idea?
"it works with another brand of camera, i have a canon","Brand is not important. Connection port and cable is important.depending on your camera, the cable (XLR for connecting to the mic and 1/4"" plug with 3.5 mm adapter to connect to your recording device/camera). If your camera's audio input is XLR, you'll need to buy a different cable. Additionally, if your camera is a dslr, you will NOT want to feed the mic in directly to your camera."
will this mic will work with canon 650D,"It would, but I recommend against it because the microphone makes a terrible hiss when plugged in to a camera (tried it with T3i and 60d)."
"Okay, I just got the thing and it doesn't work. I plug it into my Sony HDR-SR11 microphone spot and it completely turns off the sound. What do I do","Okay, first thing you must and I cant stress this enough but you must know how your camera mic jack is wired. All of my cameras that I use are canon and pentax. They are all stereo mic inputs. That means it uses 3 connectors. If you dont know what I am talking about... Take a look at a plug on a pair of headphones vs the plug that is on the mic. Chances are your camera is wire like this or real similar. I do not use the cable that comes with the mic. I use one made by Hosa that has XLR on the mic end and it has a 3 connectore(stereo)plug on the camera end. The mic is not stereo, it just simply sends the same mic signal to the tip and the ring on the stereo plug. The cable in known as a dual mono cable. If you do not use this cable the adapter that you get with the mic will ground the mic line and quite possibly do what you are experiencing. I use this mic in many situations and it works great. I get great results everytime but again it is very important that you use the right connector cable."
"I see in the Product Description it says: ""Push switch to 'TELE' for short distance or to 'NORMAL' for long distance"" Is it not the other way around?",Its actually a sliding switch not a button.
How can I use this with my old Bose 5 speaker system with all the speakers connected to the Sub Woofer??,"Yes, you can. Think of this system as an invisible wire to your speakers. You hook the speakers themselves to the receiving units with speaker wire, just like they were at the back of your sub. Then at the sub, you hook the wires from the transmitter in the old spot where you pulled out the original wires that went to your back speakers, and it should work like a charm."
"The ""wireless"" amplifiers that are dedicated to each speaker - are they battery-powered or do they need AC power?","AC Power required. Distance is very limited and requires dirct line of sight. If you can live with these limitations, okay product"
Do all three items require an AC outlet? I don't see an output for the wireless amplifiers.,"Hi Martin, all three components have a an ac-dc power transformer and need to be plugged into an ac power outlet. Take a look at the product manual for more details http://www.amphony.com/download/manuals.htm"
Are the power sources for these units dual voltage (110V/220-240V)?,"The specification label on the power supplies (3 of them) state that the input voltage is 100-240 V, but I have only used them on a 120V supply so I cannot personally say that they will work."
I notice there seems to be a circular control knob on all three units. Is this a volume control? That would be a clincher for me.,Yes
Has anyone had any issues with interference with any other 5.8GHz signals in their home. I noticed my landline cordless phone is on this frequency.,"I would not recommend this kit if you are using certain types of 5.8 GHz cordless phones such as the Panasonic Gigarange series as these phones send out a tremendous amount of interference on all channels. However, the product should work fine with 5.8 GHz video transmitters which are fixed frequency and obviously wireless networks. If you do experience wireless interference with a wireless network then you can simply set the router to avoid specific channels. My friend was able to resolve a problem with his Apple Airport Extreme by manually setting the channel. Most new phones are using the DECT standard and thus won't interfer with this kit at all."
Would these wireless amplifiers be able to sit on speaker stands with the speaker or under the speaker?,I keep mine on top of my speakers. They also have holes for wall mounting.
Some wireless amplifires power up when the input detects a signal. How do these Amp's power up? Do they have a power swtich or powerup automatic?,They have a knob to turn them on. I leave them on always.
Some wireless amplifires power up when the input detects a signal. How do these Amp's power up? Do they have a power swtich or powerup automatic?,No power switch. Just a plug and they are on. Because of the occasional feedback I unplug it when I'm not watching a movie.
"I realize that this kit will drive two speakers. What configuration do I need to support L, R, center-channel and powered-subwoofer?","Wirelessly or wired L, R, center and sub? If wirelessly you will have to find a kit that supports all the speakers. Otherwise you just wire the remaining speakers to your amplifier or AV receiver."
"Does this use the same chip as that sold by Sparkfun and Digikey? If ""yes"", how can it be so cheap? Other places seem to sell just the chip for $14.","Sparkfun is renown for their massive mark ups, never use them for price comparison. Digikey is much better, but there is still a bit of a mark up. As of this comment, they are charging $5 per chip if purchased in bulk and $10 for individual chip. Chances are, this chip is legit but the board is Chinese made."
It had NO circuit diagram - or any details. just the small cct board and chip. ANy email sent to company bounces! They sent Norwegian mail to me???,"The Arduino Playground site discusses this board under the MPU-6050 page, scroll down to the GY-521 section at http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/MPU-6050."
Is there any need to add a logic shifter for the sda and scl pin coming from my arduino mega.... my arduino mega is delivering about 4.18v,i have mine tied directly to a mega and it works perfectly.
"Hey, whats the maximum accelaration this can handle. I have an application that will achieve over 100g's so.....","If you haven't already, look up the datasheet for the chip on the board. If you're wondering about its connections to the board & the rest of the components, I have genuinely no idea. That's an interesting materials science question involving how the board was soldered, etc. Generally speaking, though, I imagine the manufacturer would tell you if the board (here the MPU-6050) is expected to handle more acceleration than the board on which it's mounted. These units are cheap enough that you can just test one, and intuitively 100G doesn't seem too bad, so you're probably OK as long as the spec sheet says the MPU-6050 will survive it."
What are the dimensions of this board?,Read the product page.
"Sorry, should have been more clear. Can this module accurately record data while accelerating over 100g's?",Sensitivity is up to 16 G. You'll saturate long before you get to 100.
Can you tell me the voltage output? I'm wondering if I could connect this directly to an IR Blaster. Thank you.,"Spec sheet for the IC is here ( http://www.invensense.com/mems/gyro/documents/PS-MPU-6000A-00v3.4.pdf ), and it looks like this board has a linear regulator to let the 3.3V chip be supplied from 5V. So it looks like the outputs are at 3.3V. If that's the voltage of your IR blaster and the protocols are compatible, sure. If you're looking to use the 'Digital Motion Processor', you'll need to figure out how to program it -- I never took the time to."
Looking at comments below - is it possible to connect multiple (5) of these to an Arduino Mega?,"Yes. It uses an i2c interface, so it is technically possible to assign them different addresses and talk to them individually. I don't know anyone who has done that before though."
"do you have gy9150? there are many at ebay, but I am not allowed to use paypal,",yes i have. it price is 17.50 +4.3 for shipping. i will listing to you.
Can it be used to design inclinometer (tilt/angle measuring device)? Thank you.,Yes
when was it made?,Apr-12
"Does this laptop have a DVD drive, and if so, is ROM or RW? Also, does it have a built in webcam? Thanks!","Yes, it has a DVD drive that can write to disks, and it has a built-in webcam. I have been very happy with mine, most particularly because it is a comfortable machine for typing--no flex in the keyboard--and it's reasonably fast."
Is the keyboard back lit?,Yes the keyboard is backlit and can be dimmed or turned off
What is the screen resolution?,1366 x 768
does it have a glossy or matte screen?,It should have a Matte screen.
Which geforce card is this?,GT 620 M on mine.
Can i connect my vga laptop to my hdmi tv using this?,No. This adapter is for connecting a laptop that has an HDMI (output) port to a regular monitor that has a VGA (input) port.
what is the length of the 3.5 mm audio cable?,approx. 3 feet.
My Monitor has One Headphone Jack..But my Speakers Connect Through a Headphone Jack..How will I get sound?,"HDMI cable carries both signals (Video + Audio) through one hdmi cable. By using this converter you can split the signal into video to the monitor and audio jack to be used for any speakers. if you want to connect more than one audio speakers, then you can use Y splitter for the audio cable to connect 2 set of speakers. Hope you find this answers your question?"
Can I use this to connect my HDMI Wii U to a VGA-Monitor?,Yes
Can I use this to convert an HDMI output to analog audio output? I'm buying a TV with no audio output but it does have HDMI output.,It works but be warned! The audio cuts out for about half a second every 5 minutes or so. This cable doesn't have a external power source so the cable relies solely on the output to feed its power source and usually it doesn't give enough which gives very low audio resolution with a tiny bit of static and noticeable audio loss. I recommend you try a different HDMI audio converter with an external power source for better results
Does this unit require external power?,"It does not have an external power supply so if you're using it with an application such as an Apple TV, it works great. Your mileage may vary. :D"
Is it the VGA fit all the laptop,the way I use it is: hdmi part of adapter to my computer then vga part of adapter to a vga cable that attaches to an old screen that just has vga. Works great
will this work with a ps4 to a monitor?,"No, It actually is garbage does'nt work in any configuration. i threw it out. don't waste your money"
Will this let me use my HDMI TV as a monitor for my netbook that is vga?,"No, this will not drive an HDMI TV from a VGA netbook. It only works the other way around. It will drive a VGA TV/Monitor from a HDMI netbook. To go from VGA to HDMI, you need a converter box and they cost considerably more."
Will this make it so I can make my droid 3.5mm output hook up to my TV's HDMI input and play my music,I'm trying to decipher what exactly you are even trying to say......You are better off getting some speakers for playing music. This device is limited to the 3.5mm cable that runs from the AUX port to your Droid (quality issues). I used this for my xbox to a computer monitor and the AUX port went to a set of speakers. Why do you need this conversion box (VGA to HDMi) if you are going from I am assuming a USB(Droid) to an HDMi(TV)? It doesn't really make sense. Unless someone else can answer it better than me.
"I need a tablet for my dad who's 82. Needs to be simple to use--he really only wants internet, email, word processing. Is this a good choice?","This is an old model. You can get the Archos 80 Titanium which is 8"" or the archos 97 Titanium. They have faster processors and don't have problems with storage when you install apps."
can you use the tablet and play games while it is charging? and,This is a piece of junk. Returned it within days.
Can this be connected to a wireless printer?,There is no way ad far as I know
Does it have Google Play ?,Yes it does!
are these compatible with npulse monster over the head headphones?,Yup :) these are basically a universal cable with the microphone feature. I had some Souls and off course couple of Monster Beats and they all work. Hope these help :)
do these fit skullcandy hesh 2?,They should as Skull Candy Headphones have an exterior aux outlet.
Is this cord compatible with skullcandy head phones,Not that I'm aware of. I just know they worked for my beats.
Picture show two straight connections but the description says one right angle. Which is it?,2 straight just like the picture!
can I control volume with this cable?,Nope. You can only turn on and off and skip a track by pressing it twice real fast. IDK what twiz718 got in the mail but mine does NOT control volume. Good luck.
"The tablet was working wonderfully, but now it keeps freezing are there any suggestions?",I have yet to have problems with mine. My old tablet refused to download books from Kindle any longer and that is how I knew it was out of memory. Did you check the amount of memory available? Do yo have many games downloaded?
"Any input for usb accessories, keyboard, mouse?","Yes, there is a mini USB port on the right side of the tablet, when in landscape mode. We have this tablet sitting quite comfortably in a 7"" tablet case with a USB keyboard connected to it."
"my tablet will not download any apps, am I doing something wrong?",Is your memory full? Do you have the device to save downloads to your SD card or internal memory? Do you have an SD card in it and the settings are trying to save to the card? Is your wireless connection preventing the download?
one of the 2 I bought will not load anymore.stuck with the little android figure;won't load further.What can I do,"Did you get a warranty, if so put in a claim and you will get a refund. If not contact seller, they are excellent at responding"
"This has Flash 10.1, NOT 11.1. Can you stream live TV? Have you had any problems with Video?","Never tried live tv, but video is fine in Netflix app downloaded from Google Play."
"What software works? Can get Samsung Magician or Migration software to work. Trying to copy to a Samsung SSD 840Evo 1TR,","I used Samsung Magician that came with my Samsung SSD for my desktop. For my laptop, I purchased an SSD from Critical which did not come with any software. The Samsung software did not recognize my Critical drive so I used a free migration software called HDClone."
How fast is the read/write speeds for a SSD through a SATA III?,"I Changed my Samsung 1 tb 5200 rpm for this SSD, and my machine become 5x faster or more, it is really fast and good upgrade"
"is it backwards compatible for usb 2.0? as in, im buying it for extra space on my raspberry pi pc and it only supports usb 2.0.",You bet
"Description says max speed=625MB/s, is this right? Confused b/c it only says explictly that it supports SATA II (300MB/s). Can confirm with SSD?","Not sure what you want to know. I have used it to clone my new SSD from my old hard drive. The important thing is that you have a computer hard drive that has a SATA connection. The adapter doesn't care if it is SATA or SATA II connection. The reason I bought this adapter was because it was USB III, which is much faster than USB II. Your computer must have a USB III port on your computer to take advantage of the extra speed, however should be backwards compatible with USB II. Hope this helps."
Does it work well with a Samsung ssd 840 evo?,I've just tried this item with old sata 5400 Mac drives.
will this adapter work with Mac OSX?,OSX Yes!
will it work with intel ssd model 335 240 gb ?,I'm sure that it would...the transfer rate depending on the version of USB
Will it work with a Yongnuo trigger and receiver?,It has been so far
"Im confused, so is this a softbox that is just shaped like an umbrella? Like does it perform the functions of any other soft box?","Yes, it performs just like any other softbox but it folds nicely like an umbrella. It's amazing! I bought one, and liked it so much that I ordered another one."
Has anyone used this with a Neewer LED light or small LED for continuous light?,"The output would be so low with LED that it's not worth the effort. This unit needs 2x85 and 2x45 CFLs to get an exposure of 1/60 @ F/5.6 ISO 400 at 6 feet. LED lamps would put you in the range of a 1/2 second exposure. Okay for still life I guess, but not people."
How is the color on this softbox compared to a Westcott Apollo? Is there any unnatural pink/blue/green color cast caused by the diffusion material?,I cannot compare this softbox to a Westcott Apollo sine I do not have one of those but I can say that there is NO color cast from using this softbox.softbox.
"Can you fit say, a three speedlight rig inside this soft box?",No.
"I have the 28"" x 28"" softbox and love it but was wondering if there is a grid style adapter available? Or another product w/ grid option?","If you have the one with the Bowens mounting system the 30"" Neewer Beehive should work. The speedlight mount is found here: http://www.amazon.com/Neewer-Bracket-Speedlite-Reflector-Umbrella/dp/B00JAAXH1A/ref=pd_bxgy_p_img_y Looks a bit ungainly at first but it works great. Link for the 30"" Beehive is HERE: http://www.amazon.com/80cmX80cm-Speedlite-Speedring-Panasonic-Neewer/dp/B00KQDTU8O/ref=sr_1_14?s=photo&ie=UTF8&qid=1421211161&sr=1-14 I'm considering it myself. Just do a search on softboxes on the Amazon site and specify the Neewer brand. Several styles are listed."
Does this item come with a stand?,No.
Does this item come with a stand?,Mine did not.
"Is this softobox so light? I mean, it weights less than 1kg (2 pounds) ?",I haven't weighed it but it is not super light it has some heft.
How can you apply the soft box to a lighting kit?,You need an umbrella adapter on your lightstand. This is a pretty good soft box but wish it was deeper.
does this have a headphone jack,"Yes. Audio outputs on left side of TV include headset, RCA (L&R) and coaxial audio."
Just hooked up and everything is great but my logic tech speakers will not emit sound from the audio out jacks. Am I missing something? Thanks for any,"I had to plug in my sound bar to the HEADPHONE jack of the TV. Try that and see if it doesn""t work for you too."
"Hi, I just got this TV and the remote control doesn't work. Changed the batteries and still nothing. Does anyone know what else can be done? UPDATE: Called tech suport for Sceptre and they will send a replacement Remote Control. Hasn't arrived yet.",I would check the pathway between the infrared signal points and make sure they're clear. You can also contact the manufacturer to have them send a replacement. I had no problems with mine when I got it. Hope this helps :) --Jess
"I have read that the ""stand"" is very flimsy and wobbles quite a bit. Has this been a problem for anyone? Thanks for any comments!","It's pretty sturdy if you install it properly. Granted, I'm not twisting and turning mine constantly but I'm not worried it's going to fall over."
"I really think this tv is a good deal, but have read many complaints about it's reliability. Is this tv a lemon in disguise?",There is always the chance you can get a lemon--no matter the brand of TV. All I can say is that I've owned 2 Sceptres for a year and can report no problems.
Anybody tried using Chromecast on this tv. I know it says Roku works wondering about googles new streaming device,i have direct sat. it works great. it should work just as well on comcast.
Anyone else lose there scanned channels each time the TV is shut off? We have cable - directly into the TV.,I have direct tv and have no problem
I see this TV has no optical audio output. Does it have HDMI 1.4/support audio return channel?,"I'm not sure about all that you are asking, all I know is that I had to plug in my Soundbar to the headphones jack for sound to come out of my soundbar. Hope this helps a littl"
does it have netflix streaming,This TV is not a Smart TV. No WIFI capability. It cannot access internet.
Does anyone know what kind of screws connect the base stand to the TV? I lost mine and no longer want it mounted on the wall.,"Hi! I do know that the screws are Phillips type approx. 1/4"" long. For exact details, you can contact Sceptre at: !-800-788-2878. They are very helpful! I STRONGLY suggest you use a power screwdriver...the fit is tight."
Hi. Does anybody know the response time for this tv? Its probably either 5ms or 8ms.. Thank You.,I belive it's 8ms..
"My tv freezes when i turn it on, the light is blue but there is no picture and the buttons are unresponsive, the only way to turn it off it to unplug","I can only say that my Sceptre TV was less that a year old when the picture went and the controls were no longer responding. Sceptre had me mail the television back to them for repairs and that was the last I saw the TV. Customer Service is poor. Accountability is poor. And, quite frankly the product is poor. The last I heard from Sceptre they sent me a picture of an undamaged box, but heel marks on the TV Screen and they suggested I contact UPS for reimbursement. They neither stand behind their products nor allow access to anyone above a Customer Service Agent. Since it has been more than 4 months since they received my television and no responses to my communication. I WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANOTHER SCEPTRE PRODUCT and will continue my fight to get my television back or the cost of the unit. In fact, I have stopped doing business with any company that continues to sell this inferior product."
Does the headphone jack make a hum?,I did not have time to use all of the features on this television before the picture tube went. I still have not heard from the company or received my property back. GREATLY DIS-SATISFIED with the product and the service.
"Why does it take 2 -5 weeks to ship? If the item were shipped in 2 - 5 days, I will purchase it. Please let me know if this is possible. thanks,",i got mine rather quickly and did not pay extra shipping.
Is this tv compatible with QAM input specifically?,My Sceptre did not last long enough to try QAM. It exhausted its life in less than a year.
what is the warnty,"The one I bought was a used one that was shipped broken and these guys took care of it right away. Other than, out of the bad, I don't recall any warranty. Sorry"
how do you connect the x-box 360 Kinect to the tv,"dont know but i doubt it's very hard. ask google or youtube, they have just about everything."
is sceptre 16 inch tv/dvd combo a good purchase?,"YES! very reliable, I've taken this TV all over the west coast as i use it in teaching presentations where a projector can't be used. we also use it in our guestroom when it's not on the road."
it doesn't turn on,Are you just stating a fact? Or is there a question in there?
"how good is the Sceptre 50"" TV's compared to other brand names","I don't know about the 50"", I have the 32"", but it's been a good basic TV. Lots of input options, 3 HDMI, s-video, RGB, USB, the picture quality is good and excellent price point for a 1080P. My only complaint is the sound, not much amplification, it definitely needs help."
If you use this for an RV do you run the cable from the receiver to the tailgator box after you stop and park? How does this work?,"Yes. It is disconnected when moving. This only works when you have stopped for the night/day. Very simple, cable is supplied with unit. As I mentioned, I have a good cable for locking outside."
Is it possible to activate without access to an existing Dish Receiver?,"Yes, instructions to activate an account come in the package. We did have an existing account, contact Dish for particulars."
Does this satellite have the capability to get internet?,"Nope, just Dish Network TV shows."
Can this be used as home receiver as well? I don't want to purchase one for home and one for camping a couple of times a year.,Sure you can use it as a home receiver. And when you're ready to go camping you can take it with you. No need to purchase 2 separete receivers and dishes. Just make sure you secure the dish wherever you set it up at so the wind doesn't knock it over or it comr up missing.
How well does it work in tree covered area?,not very well. you have to have clear view to the south.
do you have to have an account with dish to use this?,"yes, I do....but not a contract. you prepay monthly... can pay only when you use.. have had over a year.....love it. use it everyday"
"Do u have to subscribe to dish for tale gate satellite to work""? Do u have to b a dish customer?",Yes you do. They have a program where you can pay only for the months you want/need service. No contract required. We use this during the summer months while camping.
Will this work on an RV if you connect to the Cable jack outside and turn off the antenna booster. I don't have a Sat connection.,yes
Is it possible to permanently mount the Tailgater on the roof of an Airstream (or any other brand) travel trailer?,NO... they make special roof mount dish antennas for roof mount. Check camping world. You could make a removable platform for roof use during camping but the vibration when moving would most likely damange the Tailgater.
Should I get the 211z or the 211K? Any difference in the two?,While the box says it includes a 211K it will contain a 211z. I sent my original order back because it had a 211z and I wanted a 211k the second unit was the same I just kept it. The difference is the outputs the 211k has a coax output and the 211z has a HDMI output as far as I know nothing else is different. For use in an RV you have to check if you have coax (usually older) or hdmi (usually newer) input - some might have both. Nonetheless you can purchase an inexpensive adapter that goes from the RCA Jacks (on both) to coax. If you go directly to the TV via HDMI you will not have satellite at the bedroom tv. If this is not for RV use then 211z will hook directly to your flat screen TV and provide you a excellent picture.
you cant listen to music while navigating? what kind of crap is that!! somebody did it with half a screen. How?,"once navagation is started press the scr button and you can open any other app ie radio, cd, xm then tap the left button on top of the screen to flip backd forth between navagation and the other app. even if you leave the radio or cd up on the screen the navagation will sound thru the speakers when its time to turn."
Hi. Will this unit work with model VM9324?,Yes
Will this unit work with the VM9214BT?,Yes it will. Make sure you install in an area you can plug in your laptop to do updatrs
Do this works with a Pioneer AVH-X7500BT Single-DIN Multimedia DVD Receiver?,don't even consider this unit I am very unhappy with it
Will this work with the VM9213 ?,No not compatible
will this work with Jensen VX4010,No it will not. Vx4010 is not nav ready.
Will it work on my Jensen JRV212T radio,I don't have this radio so I don't know.
"Will this work for a Pioneer AVH-X4600BT 7""??",No
Where is the best spot to put the antenna?,I placed mine on the dash of my ford truck. It worked well there.

Does the pin for these batteries fit into a Motorola model MBP36 PU baby monitor? The specs for the battery are identical.,I am not sure since I do not have that monitor but my quess would be yes. Contact the vendor and ask them to be sure. They probably have information that it does or does not fit.
How many batteries are included? title denotes 3 batteries (3X???) details reads two?? pls clarify,I think it was 2 packs of 3 ea. I believe I ordered 2 and ended up with 6 batteries. Should last a few years.
We are planning a presentation system using a PC connected to wall-mounted TV. Will sound from this microphone pass on to the TV speakers?,"I can not be sure, it would think it depends on you set up. Let me share my experience, maybe that will help you. I used a set of speakers in the front of the classroom. The mic was placed on desk approximately 7 to 8 feet from the speakers. The mic worked extremely well and did not pick up anything from the speakers. Hope that helps."
Is this device a speaker as well? or just a microphone?,It is just a microphone though a very good one for the price.
The photo shows a USB connector. The description says 3.5mm plug. Which connector does this have?,usb
i want to know how much area is covered by single mic of this type. What is the radius of area which can be covered by single mic,"I cannot give you a precise answer but I have information that might help. I have a 12'x24' conference room with a 4'x16' table in the middle of the room that seats 4 people on each side. I have a CM-1000USB microphone in the middle of the table and 2 CM-1000 microphones attached to it on each side (about 5' from center). In a recent meeting, with people in the room and people in several remote locations, the presenter walked around the room the whole time. Even though the presenter wasn't wearing a microphone, the 3 microphones on the table picked her up so well that people in the remote locations had no difficulty hearing the presenter. Note that our meeting software has an audio meter and I am able to adjust microphone volume in Windows, if needed. I rarely need to adjust microphone volume (unless there is somebody who is, truly, softspoken talking). Note, as well, that as with any omni-directional microphone, that all sounds within the range of the microphone are picked up. So, if someone at the table is speaking and someone else is drumming their fingers on the table, both are picked up by the microphone. There are situations where a uni-directional or bi-directional microphone might be more appropriate than an omni-directional microphone."
Can this microphone be used with voice recognition software?,I doubt it would perform well. This is an omni-directional microphone. A directional mike would be better for voice recognition.
Is there any benefit to getting the USB version over the 3.5mm aux version?,"Yes and no. For one microphone attached to a standard Mac or PC, I suggest the USB model as it has has a built-in driver. If using something other than a standard Mac or PC, the 3.5mm Plug model might be a better choice as it would have no built-in driver. For two microphones attached to a standard Mac or PC, I suggest using one USB model and one 3.5mm Plug model plugged into one of the input jacks on the USB model (there are two inputs, the instructions indicate which input to use on the USB model). For multiple microphones attached to a standard Mac or PC, one USB model combined with one or more 3.5mm Plug models would be best. The USB model has both left and right inputs so that users can daisy-chain one or more 3.5mm Plug models into each input. If I had a 30-foot conference table, I could place the USB model in the middle of the table with two 3.5mm Plug models on one side and three 3.5mm Plug models on the other side for a total of 6 microphones on the table. I presently use a similar setup on a smaller table and get great audio unless somebody is drumming his fingers or tapping her pen on the table."
Would this Sound Tech CM-1000 USB work well for voice control of a computer?,"No, this an omni-directional microphone built to work in ""sound all around"" environments, such as conference rooms. For voice control, a directional (preferred) or bi-directional microphone (will work okay in many situations) would be much better because they focus on the voice and block background noise which, in turn, allows a computer to better understand the voice commands which results in increased accuracy."
I broadcast whiteboard workshops via WebEx in a classroom what kind of pick up does this mic have? Will this support a large room like a classroom?,"I have a 12'x24' conference room with a 4'x16' table in the middle of the room that seats 4 people on each side. I have a CM-1000USB microphone in the middle of the table and 2 CM-1000 microphones attached to it on each side (about 5' from center). In a recent meeting, with people in the room and people in several remote locations, the presenter wandered around the room constantly. Even though the presenter wasn't wearing a microphone, the 3 microphones on the table picked her up so well that people in the remote locations had no difficulty hearing the presenter. Note that our meeting software has an audio meter and I am able to adjust microphone volume in Windows, if needed. I rarely need to adjust microphone volume (unless there is somebody who is, truly, softspoken talking). Note, as well, that multiple CM-1000's can be daisy-chained into each of the 2 channels of a single CM-1000USB. I don't recall the recommended maximum number of CM-1000's per channel but I have heard of people using 3 or 4 in each channel without any issues. By the way, when daisy-chaining, it isn't necessary to have an equal number of CM-1000's in each channel. It is okay to have 1 in one channel and 2 in the other channel."
Can you help me make it work for a Mac Mini? It doesn't work when plugged into the USB port.,"The Sound Tech CM-1000USB is a standard USB microphone that can be plugged into a USB port on a PC or Mac (including the Mac Mini). If the mic doesn't, I would try another USB microphone. If another mic works, I would wonder if the CM-1000USB is defective. If another mic doesn't work, I would follow the steps in the articles below to debug. 1. http://www.ehow.com/how_5254822_use-mic-mac-mini.html 2. http://forums.appleinsider.com/t/61148/mac-mini-and-usb-microphone 3. http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1367478"

How does the iPhone snap the picture if your holding the monopod Handel?,"You have to download a timer app, I use TimerCam"
"does it need the wifi access for ""timer app"" ??",This is just an arm extension with a fancy clip holder for the iPhone. Very useful but has nothing to do with wifi access or apps.
"This may be a stupid question, but how do you keep the handle out of the picture in a selfie?","it's all about the angle of the shot. You'd have to really try to get the handle in the shot, like sit the camera flat on the bar. It's really not an issue."
Can this be used in roller coasters or any amusment park rides? Can it hold my phone secured and tightly?,"I would not recommend using it on one because the wind might make your phone slip of the clip. If you tape it with duck tape, most definitely."
Does it fit a Samsung Galaxy S5 ?,I dont think so. Search extendable for the S5. It didnt fit my Samsung mega.
can it hold an iPad mini?,"I don't know the width of an iPad Mini, but I have a feeling it wont fit."
How do you use this? I don't see any button to push to take the picture? Was this supposed to come with a remote? I am thinking I am missing parts?,It doesn't come with a remote nor it has a shutter button unlike those knock off's.
does this work with a windows phone ?,will not recommend for it
Does this now ship with the improved phone mount that has no problem with little rubber piece.?,"Same, sometimes it comes off. You have to secure it properly."

Does this come with a screen protector? or just the top/bottom/sides,"Just the bottom, top and wrist area. No screen protector."
"What's in the box? Does the ""full body"" set include a screen protector as well as top, bottom, and wrist-rest/trackpad protectors?","I suggest you to buy the combo (top, bottom and wrist-rest/trackpad). If you calculate the price for individual pieces, the logical investment is to buy the complete protection. On the other hand, you have to buy the screen protector separately. I recommend this one: MegaGear MacBook Retina 15-Inch Screen Frame Anti - Glare Protector."
"It says 'per-order' with 1-2 months for delivery, do you have a better ETA on product delivery? Is the product even being produced yet?",I've ordered mine on July 16th. It should arrive by tomorrow as per the item tracker (already nearby.) Bought it off Bodyguardz. Costs more for shipping but it beats waiting for Amazon to have it in stock.
what side is the active speaker placed? left or right,"Good question. Nothing is indicated on the device itself so only stereo testing should answer this question. I've not perdormed it yet as my installation needs a longer cable to connect between both speakers. The cable provided is only 1,5m long (ridiculous) but after contacting edifier repeatedly, they promised me to send a 3m one within 7 days. Pay attention to this fact if you are planning to use those speakers with a placement between a couch for exemple. Sound quality is very balanced and very satisfying for audiophiles. Remote control is fragile though but very addictive to manipulate. Best regards."
I put the control speaker on the left side! Does it really matter?I can't tell any difference in sound!,"Nope, I've done the same."
Just bought them! Do you think they will perform well?P.S.Thanks for the input.,My hubby loves his. His had an issue and the company replaced them in a week. We haven't had an issue with them since.

If they have no power switch how do you turn them on?,Via the remote control.
does spinnaker go to sleep if not shut off?,No auto shut-off but draws very little power when not in operation. I leave mine on all the time.
What is the warranty? I keep reading mixed reviews about the speakers having issues. Has anyone had a set that has lasted more than 2 years?,"I didn't like the quality of,the sound and gave them away to our son who has them in his office at school.

tv,I use the Edifier only for music from an iphone....1800+ tunes ready to play wirelessly...magnificent ! It does not supply surround sound..just real hi-fi stereo. The more expensive line of Vizio TV sound bar gives real surround sound and lets you emphasize speech for clearer listening...also lowers commercials automatically if they get too loud. Both machines are great in their place.

"Is it just a matter of feeding this a step and direction, or does this need the A/B signals phased correctly for a stepper?",This does not handle steppers directly (step/dir) and you must apply the phase signals properly. There are lots of methods to do this but the easiest is with a microcontroller. Another example: http://www.theremin.us/Circuit_Library/bioplar_stepper_motor.htm
"Will i be able to use a 12v power supply with this? i'm confused on what ""can board to take power +5v"" means.","Yes. With a 12v supply, use the onboard voltage regulator to supply the onboard 5v. There will be either a switch or jumper to use the onboard regulator. Don't supply over 16v volts with the regulator activated, or it will fry. Gooogle ""L298 Users guide"""
there are jumpers and a switch. anyone know how to add a resistor to set the current limit or what the jumpers are for ?,"There are several flavors of this board out there so I may be incorrect. The switch simply gates the supply to and from the VCC regulator. The jumpers I believe go to the enable signals for each motor. As for the current limit, I believe you will have to limit the motor supply input current in some way. You can find the datasheet for the IC here: https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/General/L298N.pdf"

Will these work with the tc-p60st60?,"Yes, they will. I have the TCP50ST60 which is the same hardware, just a smaller screen. They work well. I do have ghosting in my 3D content, but I don't think that is from the glasses. I think it is a calibration issue or something else."
Bought these in March and they have been performing very well--but now one of the 4 glasses I purchased is not charging.,The glasses I purchased are not rechargeable. You need to replace the battery located in the center of the nose piece.
Are these compatible with TC-P50UT50 2012 Panasonic Viera?,I believe that they are as long as your television uses RF technology. Your model number of your TV ends with 50 and it was made in 2012.

Will this work with Sylvania SDVD8732?,"If you need an audio/video cable for your vehicle portable screens, Yes it will work"
how long is this cable?,My apologies James. I do not know the exact measurments of the cable. I use it for the DVD system in my car and it requires tapering off-due to the length. It works well for entertainment systems as well.
Will this cable work for transmitting sound AND video from screen-to-screen on my Philips dual screen portable dvd player Model #PET7402/37?,"Yes, as far as I know it will, it has three channels on it...2 audio 1 video...we don't have the same model# but it should work."
Mac support?,Works fine with mavericks on MacBook Pro.
What cords are needed to connect this to a desktop? just a simple usb?,Use a VGA or HDMI cord to connect to the monitor(not included). Use the included USB cord to connect to the desktop.
Has anyone tried to run 4 monitors on a laptop with this adapters? I have a radeon 7670m 2gb will it be enough to handle them (no gaming)?,"I currently run 5 monitors (3 evga, 1 thunderbolt, 1 macbook pro built in) off of a Radeon HD 6750M.

I am out of USB ports and need to turn to a external USB hub. Will a external hub substantially harm the display refresh rate or anything else?,"I am running two screens off of PC which refresh fine. I added this hub to support my security monitoring. It does work, but runs 60-90 seconds behind on refresh rate."
Can I connect my Macbook Air with 2 monitors (HDMI and DVI) simultaneously? My USB is 3.0 but is a USB hub like this http://goo.gl/dRbKUp. Tks,You should really have a USB3 hub for this EVGA adapter. I believe you can use both HDMI and DVI simultaneously. One of my co-workers tested it out and it seemed to work fine on his 2012 Macbook Pro. You may also be able to use the thunderbolt port and get a MiniDP-&gt;DVI (or hdmi) adapter for a third monitor.
does this work with windows 8?,"I don't know - mine died after just 4 months of use. Terrible support policy, stay away!"

Does the power adapter come with an Australian standard 3 pin power plug? (AS/NZS 3112 (Type I)).,"I would guess if it was ordered from Amazon US it will come with the two conductor (ungrounded) AC cord which plugs into the power supply block. Best to ask the vendor where it is being shipped from, that would determine the AC cord that would be shipped with the unit. If it's coming from the US an adaptor would be needed."
"What is the actual native pixel resolution of this projector? The manufacturer's website says ""720p, 1600x1200"" which makes no sense.",Native resolution of Q5 is 1280x800. Source http://www.myqumi.com/en/specs.php
Does this projector support keystone adjustments (to make it square when pointing upwards at an angle),Yes it does.
"How big will the projection be at the maximum distance (9.9"")?","90'"" There's also an excellent calculator at http://vivitekusa.com/calculator.php?prod=Qumi+Q5"
Is this project MHL compatible meaning can i use my Android phone with this?,Hello- I really am not sure about Android. Mine is hooked up to an IPAD. It works very well & is bright.

my msi A6200 laptop originally came with a 4400mAh battery. is this 6600mah battery compatible with my laptop?,Yes. The higher mah just means that the battery will last longer than your old one.

Should this work on a GT683DXR?,"I am sorry dude, I don't know the answer to that."

"Do the speakers have to be plugged into a wall outlet, or is it just the transmitter?",They (and transmitter) must be plugged into wall outlet

"If i buy 4 speakers, do i need two transmitters",No
"Does an iPod/iphone need to be docked or can I change tracks, volume from the phone as I am walking around with it in my pocket",It needs to be docked
"i need 6 speakers, all will be outside. can two transmittars transmit to 6 speakers at the same time from the same source (a smsrtphone)","I am not sure. The source has to plug directly into the transmitter. The speakers are wireless and need power from an outlet (no batteries) as does the transmitter. But the source needs a 3.5 mm (headphone size) cable to connect to each transmitter. You could try a Y cable but the transmitters could interfere with each other, I haven't used 2 so I don't know if they would interfere. I have my transmitter plugged into a sonos connect so I can use the sonos system to have wireless music with my smart phone and have outdoor speakers because sonos doesn't make one for outdoors."
Can I run speaker wires from my receiver into these or do I have to use an MP3 player?,You can't run speaker wires but it has a 3.5 mm input on the transmitter. It's the size you use for headphones. If your receiver has a headphone out jack you can plug that into transmitter and then wirelessly transmit sound to speakers. The transmitter has to be plugged into a power outlet as does each speaker.
Do they need to be plugged in to AC or are they battery operated also?,"Need to be plugged in. The docking station also needs to be plugged in, but the transmission is wireless. We had to return the first set relatively soon after purchase, but have received a replacement that the vendor reports is improved. Will have to wait until summer to try them out."
Do these provide stereo or mono sound,Stereo sound
Do they have threaded holes on the back so they can be mounted?,"I would go and look but the speakers are at my other place. Nevertheless, the controls for pairing, volume, and tone are all on the rear of the speakers and I access the controls frequently rather than go inside to whatever I have them paired with. You would be better off with a wall shelf. I can tell that these speakers have great sound!"
How long are the speaker cords? And do they have to be plugged in at all times?,Don't get these speakers are overrated and underpowered. Lots of distortion.
"This says it's used for a 2.5 inch drive. I'm assuming that means laptop drives. Would this not work with a standard 4"" Desktop Computer tower drive?",No
Stupid question. Why would I need two USB ports at the same time?,One USB port does not have enough power to run a drive
"I have a G550 Lenovo, with a seagate momentus 250 GB hard drive. Will I be able to use this adapter to transfer data?","Generally if it has a standard SATA connection, it should work. The only thing I could see a possible issue with would be the encryption that the drive uses and if special software would be necessary. I don't know much about that type of drive."
I have a Western Digital HDD interface SATA from my Laptop. is this cable compatible with my HDD?,"Although the transfer speed will depend on USB 2 and/or the type of SATA you have (1, 2, or 3), if you have a 2.5 inch HDD which is SATA, the cable associated with this question is compatible."
"to work the usb sata converter need to plug both usb's because i have macbook air and has 2 usb port, 1 left &amp; 1 right. not 2 in the same side.","I think, if your USB port has enough power, it will work with one plug.

It pairs up with you home computer and allows you to stream the content from your computer via your home router.
what are the dimensions of the remote,Approx 2 x 4 x .5 inches
Is there a Fast Forward and Rewind button on the remote. Are there multiple speeds to go FF or Rewind? If so what are the speeds?,"Yes, but I highly recommend not getting this device. Get a wdtv."
"Would I be able to use HDMI to get the picture to my projector, while at the same time using a separate cable to extract the audio to my speakers?",yes
Will this media player handle DTS audio out to my home theater reciever? I have bad luck finding a media player that outputs DTS 5.1 via MKV files,The player has a S/PDIF optical output so presumably it will output PCM audio. I haven't tested it as I'm using audio from the HDMI output but an online review at http://tinyurl.com/k8ae2lh lists DTS as one of the audio formats it will decode and output.
Does this device have an autoplay feature? Or do you need to access a menu and select play and repeat?,"You do have to interact with a menu. It is simple and intuitive. I have never let it have access to only one movie at a time, so I cannot speak to its behavior when it only has access to one movie. Mine runs off a 500 MB hard drive with a couple hundred movies on it."
Does anyone know the maximum hard drive size that can be connected to this device?,"The official ""Moboplay"" booklet which comes with the device does not indicate the maximum hard drive which can be connected, for I have only only connected my 64 gig usb pen drive and had no problem. The booklet just indicates that ""It can drive external USB storage devices such as USB HDD or USB pen drive, support FAT/NTFS file system."" thanks Chris"

Is this monitor the flicker free/zero flicker version?,"Neither of the 2 I bought ""flicker"", they work great. Could you elaborate on what you mean?"
Is the screen matte or glossy. I hate glossy screens,"Not overly glossy at all, my main screen faces my ceiling fan directly and i have no glare issues from it on the screen itself, whereas i can see each bulb on the fan on the much more glossy bezel. I have no glare issues at all with it."
what is HDMI and what does it do?,It stands for High Definition Media Interface and is cable connection between your source (HD-DVR or other HD device) to this monitor which allows High Definition image of up to 1080i resolution.
"Can I use Headphones to hear in-game audio through an xbox? Is there a 3.5 mm port to do so? If not, will I be forced to buy a new stereo system?","My son reports that the headphone gear he has used (Triton, Turtle Beach) plug into the back of his Xbox, not the monitor."
Does this monitor have an HDMI port?,No
"Will this monitor work on an xbox 360? If so, which display (VGA or DVI) will have less input lag/ delay?","The best connection is with the DVI, this will give you the fastest response time and the best picture as it keeps it all digital. I only use these on my computer and they are great. Hope this helps."
could you plug your ps3 in and game?,As long as you have something that will convert the end of you HDMI cable from the PS3 to a DVI connection. Something like this: http://www.amazon.com/Monoprice-DVI-D-Single-Female-adapter/dp/B001VKQR5U
I need to be sure it has VGA connection? I don't want to need an adapter since I will connect to my laptop with VGA only.,VGA and dvi are both present. Amazon shipped mine with the wrong power cord.
Does it work v&iacute;a hdmi to dvi converter in 1080p for the ps4?,"Yes, but it won't look as clear as straight HDMI."
Would you prefer this than any other mp3 players,another mp3 player

what all does it do?,it is a huge waste of money. while it does have apps and an mp3 player its a piece of junk. the screen is not useful better off buying an android phone with wifi. Thats what I did. Oh and it took a month for them to get it to me.
Can you download a texting app on it??,No
Can I put a defender case on it?,Yes you can..
does it come with wifi?,It doesnt come with wifi... If you're considering buying this product man just dont buy it...
8,You put 8 on the question. What are you asking?
Does this product connect to wifi?,It's suppose to but I haven't been able to connect at all. I don't recommend this product.
how do u put music on this item i had it almost a year i never knew how to put music on this item,Connect via usb to computer download your music from there I also downloaded sharebear which helped transfer music that I had in my amazon music cloud account make sure U have an Sd card placed within and if there is music on it prior it will get picked up. griffinyak@msn.com
can i use version fios,Yes it's almost like it was made for Verizon Fios. You need one Ethernet/Coax adapter; 2 RG6 cables and a 2.5ghz bi-directional splitter. Don't use the coax out on the Ethernet/Coax adapter or you will lose On Demand and Guide. Split coax from wall and run to the adapter and STB. Follow this guide http://www.dslreports.com/faq/15984
"All the splitters in my house are 1GHZ, including a Coax AMP. Would I need to switch all the splitters out in order to get this device to work?","You need 2 GHz splitters and no amps in the signal path between the MoCA boxes. Splitters not in the path don't matter. If the cable runs to each MoCA box are on separate amp outputs, then combine the runs on outputs of a splitter fed by a single amp output."
"Wireless router is in a different room, ps4 has a weak signal. Can i use this for coax in, and then coax out to TV, as well as ethernet to ps4?","i had issues with both the ethernet and coax speed when i used this to split both. i would recommend using a coax splitter to have the TV signal NOT run though this adapter. then, assuming that your coax network is part of your router's LAN, use this to convert coax to ethernet for the PS4. assuming that you have FIOS, refer to this for networking info: http://www.dslreports.com/faq/verizonfios/3.0_Networking"
Can I split the signal going out of the adapter and into a gigabit ethernet switch?,"If you mean can you send the ethernet/network output into a switch - yes, definitely, I do this at home for a home office. The other output (the built-in split) is the cable and you'd send that to a TV or set top box, etc - that's not network, but RF."
"Does this work with AT&amp;T U-verse? If so, will one of these MoCA devices allow me to split the coax going into the DVR and provide ethernet to the TV?","Yes, it should work just fine. You will run one cable off the coax splitter into the DVR and the other into the Actiontec. And you will have your Ethernet for the TV, providing that your U-verse router is MoCA enabled. The splitter I have been using is the RCA DH24SPF Two Way 3 Ghz Bi-Directional Splitter."
I have internet from Centurylink from my HOA and cable from Comcast. do I need this adapter for a Tivo Roamio plus or the basic Roamio?,you don't actually need it for your cablework with either Roamio. I strongly suggrst that you call Tiiiivo and ma ke sure the Roamio works with your cable system and then talk to them about using the actiontec MOCA. some cable and satellite systems wont work with Roamio.
Warrantee,Yes.
Can I use the Actiontec to connect my antenna cable output to my wireless router so I can stream to a TV with Roku in another room?,"No. The reason is that the ActionTec is designed to handle mix of ActionTec router sending out information over Ethernet connected to one ActionTec unit in this listing over coax cable instead of cat 5 or 6 network cable. But using the same coax cable for the TV antenna signals plus Ethernet does not mix. Yes you can solve that with more special devices, but in this case you are better off running a separate antenna cable, as that is the less expensive solution."
does it work with verizon fios,Yup and you only need 1 adapter
will this work with a vonage modem for telephone use?,Probably -- there's a little bit of lag induced in the conversion from ethernet to coax.
Dose it work on Samsung S3?,Yes it does I have one and works well
I got 2 pairs and nothing in instructions about pairing bluetooth.need to know what to do?thank you,Well I have 2 computer engineering friends and they could not figure it out so I would say u were ripped off like I was sorry I could not help you if u figure it out please pass it on to me thank u and have a good day

which version of windows? 7 or 8?,"I was told it was 7, but it is 8."
Is it upgradible,"Yes, you can upgrade HDD, and memory."
Does this all in one computer have wireless keyboard and wireless mouse? Thanks!!,"Yes Sharon, the Omni All-in-one has a wireless keyboard and a wireless mouse. It keeps your workspace clean and organized, free of cluter. Some people pay extra money for these wireless devises. Robert"

"Does anyone know what the timings are for this RAM? I am trying to check whether this will fit my Dell XPS 8700 which reports 11-11-11-28.

Does this screen work with ASUS K53E-BD4TD model,YES

What is the Operating software? Windows 7 or Windows 8.,Windows 7

Thank you in advance.","No, those glasses will absolutely not fit in this case. Those are the Gunnars I selected, and while they are absolutely wonderful to use, it is very difficult to find a case that will accept them due to their large-size while closed. Surprisingly enough, I finally found a case at Walmart for seven dollars that works great."
How much is the shipping to Lima - Per&uacute;,About One to Two weeks
Anyone get this that owns the Gunnar Vayper style? Does that model fit well?,"I have 2 pairs, one Phantom and a pair of the Edge Rimless model. The Vayper is very close to the Phantom style and both of mine fit just fine."

So they fit well in the case with a little room for space on the sides. I don't see why the interceptors wouldn't fit in the case as they fold and I would say it would depend on the width and height more than the length. Which they look almost the same in dimensions. Product Looks as it is on the website. I hope you figure it out."
Do these have noise isolation feature ?,I find that about 50% of the noise intensity is reduced. I do hear the keyboard noises when I am typing at work and not playing any music on the headphones. But I believe it differs from person to person and how well the headphones will fit on their ears.
Can you hear a hissing sound when using??,No. I have been using the headphones for a few months now. Still no such sound.

bass,Very good bad news less then two months later the left ear speaker is crackling already

Will the Sony DVP FX97 play music only CDs?,"Yes. I just tried it. A track, time display & menu appears, the disc starts playing. The FF, skip buttons operate as usual, the arrow keys navigate the small menu. I'd suggest turning sound ""enhancements"" off; speakers do ok with vocals, headphones are better. If running on battery, might as well use minimum backlight; i didn't play it long enough to see if the screen saver kicks in."
"Does it plug into an electrical outlet or a car charging ,ie cigarette lighter area","It plugs into both (2 separate plugs). I would not recommend buying this because it has a design flaw. You have to press on the area where you insert the dvd to open it (there is not an ""open"" button). After just a few weeks of use my player now pauses and skips intermittently. I am past my return period and Sony wants to charge me to ""repair"" it. I'm looking for a new one with a better design."
"Trying to register product. Sony's registration page says ""Product currently not available in our database"" I tried: 12C5 S01-1025966-F and DVP-FX97.",They don't make this model any longer. Not sure why you can't register. May need to call them. Sorry
Fit in a car holder?,"After consulting my ""inner translator"" for an accurate rendering of your question, I moved my Sony portable to our garage downstairs. The DVD player immediately began a routine of push-ups and sit-ups! So...the answer, Kim, is: Yes, it IS fit in our car holder and should be in your car holder, too."
"Found this review for Sony DVPFX980 9-Inch Screen DVD Portable. In case of a problem ur warranty doesn't do much, I suppose. Anyone have any issues with FX97?

Is this compatible with BOWENS type modifiers?,"It's kind of universal, so long as it fits over the flash head or reflector. My dynalite heads are like 5 inch, I think this was 6 or 6.5. Measure your strobe and double check the spec to be certain."
I have a neewer c-300 light will this speedring work I want to attach a soft box and theys ent me a balcar speedring and it won't fit my neewer.,Yes it should work. It fits over the light casing itself. I used it with a smith victor light. Worked easy with no issues.
"Will this fit ""GODOX GODOX 300DI Studio Strobe Photo Flash Light 300w.","Yes it will,. Its a little heavy when you add the softbox. Just make sure you have a good stand"
can we use this to hold the Fotodiox Octobox ?,"Don't know the specs on the Fotodiox Octobox, but the speedring specs are accurate in the Amazon product description. I have some Photogenic strobes, and these are the only speedrings that I was able to find that would fit them. They appear versatile enough to fit anything within parameters of the product description. Try them and return them if they don't fit."
Will this work with a photoflex starlight tungsten light? Does it come with the rods?,"I don't know if it fits photoflex, but it doesn't come with rods."
"I want to modify a beauty dish, that has a 4.5 speedring base. Will this screw in to the rotating ring and hold it?","This is a great ring, I bought two and use them on a no name brand strobe with a 5"" base, it adjusts and holds well."
"I want to order 2 of these for 2 strip boxes that measure 12x80, will these work?",These things are massive. The will support anything you can attach to it.
can i use this ring with a Canon 430 flash,"No its specifically designed for studio strobes, it a heavy speedring and would likely damage an on camera flash"
Does this work for the 48 inch octobox for speedlites?,"It should work. There are enough mounting holes and setup at the right angles. I used it with a 65"" octo. should be the same."
Has anyone tried this with the cheaper Neewer strobes?,"The cheaper strobes are often very light in weight so be aware of balance with the softbox attachef. This works great for me, I've had no issues with the ring."
Is this tablet still covered by warranty?,Yes it had 1 year warranty. You do have to pay shipping to Asus if something happens though. It is parts and labor warranty only. Do yourself a favor and get a Squaretrade warranty that covers shipping charges and can fix the tablet faster if there is an issue. Also on the tf300 no gorilla glass and I found out the hard way it lacked gorilla glass.
Does this tablet TF300 supports 3G networking i.e SIM card slot available and functional?,"No, this is the wifi model. But you have one with 3G if you want.I think it's the TF3000TG. Good luck!"
Is this tablet actually an Asus product or a copy cat?,"Hi Willy, it is ASUS original. my one bought here just had some issues and I sent back for repair so they checked serial number and it is original Ciao, Andrea"

Does this device have a front-facing camera?,Yes. It takes decent pictures but great for Skype and such.
Does this include the keyboard dock?,"No, it does not."
Can I use it on 3G or 4G AT&amp;T network ??,The tablet I have is for WiFi only. But some do work with AT&T 4G and 3G.
Can I use the USB to charge my iPhone while I broadcast radio?,Nope. You can plug it up and it will look like it is. It acts like it's charging but dies at the same rate.
Mine neither came with an audio cable or SD card and it has no internal memory. Am I missing these items?,"It should have come with a chord that resembles a headphone chord with the two ends the same. It does not come with a SD card or an internal memory abilities. You want to go buy a SD card from like Walmart or Office Depot, they are like $8. when you look at the piece that plugs into the ligher outlet there is a slot on the side for the SD card, and this is the ONLY feature that the remote works with!! If you plug your Ipod or MP3 player in, the MP3 player is the remote. =0)"
"What types of music files can you put on the USB drive to play with this transmitter (MP3 only or can it be others such as WAV, etc.)? Thanks!",I just use MP3 and is ok
can i plug my usb into this device &amp; it play the music from the usb? also if this a mp3 player how do you load music onto it?,"I haven't tried that but I'm pretty sure you could. I personally use an 8GB SD card. However, it doesn't show the sub-directories and also there is no shuffle. So what I did was basically put all my songs in the root folder which works pretty well."
Will this upconvert/scale video files and enhance the video quality like my ps3 does/did?,No this just does direct scaling
what above netflix it is supported?,"NO. You cannot access Netflix or create a link that will work. I have spent some time on this and the only streaming sites I could reach were mostly the built-in chinese sites. Do not count on the manual either to help you, it is one of the least useful I have seen for such product, documenting the obvious, and silent on the rest."
"Couple of questions, Question 1. How to sort folders alphabetically listed with samaller icons? I access media from a NAS using network connectivity.","The sorting of files/folders was also discussed with customer service at KDLinks. I pointed this out to them and they claim that they will address it in a future firmware upgrade. I also pointed out that each time a new dvd .iso file is played, the Subtitle function seems to be ""On"" by default and it was suggested that they default subtitling to ""Off"". Hope this helps."
MKV-3D Files,Yup. No problem.
Where's the tumbnail view option?,"Mine, already had the thumbnail view when I turned it on. If you add the artwork in JPG format to the same folder in which you have your video files then the thumbnail will display the artwork for the thumbnail. Keep in mind that the video file and JPG file have to have the same name. Hope this helps."
What are the differences between the HD700 and the HD720?,"Looking at the HD720 spec, I immediately notice this difference ~ ""Built In 3.5"" SATA/SATA2 Hard Disk Drive Bay With Up To 3TB of Storage Space (HDD is not included). It Can Also Be Used as USB 3.0 High Speed External Hard Drive Enclosure"" HD700 does not have HDD enclosure."
does this player support dlna? I want to stream the video from my hdhomerun to my tv?,It works with HDHomerun Prime.
"So this will play DVD iso and Blu ray iso files streamed from a NAS device, want to make sure?","Yes. Although with my wireless N network playback is glitchy/stuttery 30 feet away. It's best to hook up an external HD to it (you can then share the HD over your network to transfer or watch movies wirelessly from your computer). This gives me perfect playback of the few ISO that I have (just started to convert my small collection), one of which is 40GB."
Will this work with 3TB USB drives? My old Boxee can't recognize anything larger than 1TB.,I've used a 4tb and it worked fine.
Will there ever be another firmware update for this device? The Youtube app feels very clunky and freezes 70% of the time I try accessing it.,"The strength of the box is its ability to recognize and play a wide variety of media files which is great, but that's it. All the other accoutrements are ""clunky"" and in some cases unusable at best."
does it have a hole in the back in order to take pictures,Yes it does. I very much enjoy the Snugg cover. I've had mine for a year.
what kind of guarantee_,"Great One, lifetime!"
Can I play Bluetooth music while using the Keyboard,"Yes, the iPad is capable of connecting to more than one Bluetooth device at a time: in this case, a keyboard and speakers. I do it all the time, and although in fairness it's a different keyboard than the Snugg I'm using now I don't doubt that one can send audio via Bluetooth from your iPad without losing the connection with the Snugg."
Will I need to initially connect the Snugg IPad portable keyboard to a MAC computer for it to work?,"I'm pretty sure it has no connection to your Mac computer. It's made as a keyboard for Ipads. It took me less than 3 minutes to hook it up to my Ipad 2. Just follow the directions on the box & it should have typing you typing right away. It will look similar to a laptop, only smaller."
the picture shows the keyboard to be white. I want a black or gray case with black keys. Is it white or black,Mine is metallic silver with white keys.
Are the keys soft or hard?,"Hard, but easy to type on. I have found it very useful, much easier than typing one letter at a time with a stilus"
Is it compatible with the iPad Air?,I don't know but I would not buy the product. It was horrible!!!!!
I am not sure what I pad Ihave I was told it was a 2nd generation. Does this work for this I pad/??model 1395 . 6 dhw?,I bought it for my trip to Europe in Sept thinking it would be great instead of lugging a laptop. It WAS for the first week but then after that it started falling apart and the plastic ON button broke off so I couldn't get it to work at all. By the time I got back from my trip it was too late to get my money back so I had to drop it in the recycle bin. I wouldn't recommend this - needs improvement!
Does this cover have the automatic sleep/wake for the ipad,"I don't know, I have an IPad Air, it didn't fit mine so I sent it back."
What color is the snug I pad cover,Keyboard is white. cover exterior is metallic.
"Is this For the 7"" or 8.9"" HD screen?","This is for the original Kindle Fire 7"" screen. Works like a charm. This is not the Kindle Fire HD screen. Also, I dismantled mine first to confirm the right connection as two different electronic connections were used depending on the date of manufacture. Ive been very pleased with this product. If you don't have the screen removal tool kit it will help you in the long run to not create more damage to your Kindle."
i have a broken glass on my amazon kindle model p48wvb4; which glass do i need to buy and is it together with the lcd,"I only know that this screen was a perfect match for my first generation Kindle Fire. The model on mine is D01400 (shown on the back of the Kindle). From everything I read, Kindle Fires have separate glass and LCD components. Because they are separate, the display should still work if only the screen is broken, and my broken screen still respond to touch as well. If your screen cracked and your display is not working, I think you will need both the screen and the LCD display replaced."
Does this include adhesive on the screen or do I need to buy that separately? The reviews make it sound included.,"it is included, preinstalled on the glass."
"help: my kindle fire team suffered a fall, cracking his Pantall, which still works 100%, which parts should I buy to solve my case?","If the it's only the screen that is cracked, then all you need is the front glass which can be installed using a tutorial guide on YouTube. If the screen won't display some images, then you will have to buy a new LCD as well."
Does this fit kindle fire HD ?,"Not that I know of. I bought this for the second generation Kindle Fire 7""."
"I dropped my kindle and now the top half of the screen is whited out, but the bottom half is fine. Will this fix the issue?","Probably not. Sounds like you damaged the actual computer, not just the glass."
"Will it fit Kindle Fire HD 7"" X43Z60?",No that digitizer will only fit the fire not the HD 7inch.
I see that people say that they have used this as a replacement screen for both the Kindle Fire 1st gen * AND* 2nd gen - which is it for? thanks!,"I used it to replace on my wife's 2nd gen, so that's the only one I know for sure it will work on"
"Hello, i have 3rd generation (d026) kindle fire. Will this work?",I just installed this digitizer on my Kindle with serial number starting with D026. Open your kindle up first to compare the shape of the plug. Ordered with prime shipping.
Kindle Fire wil not charge. It has a new battery charger.,"I am an electronic repair technician. It is likely the charge port that has gone bad (the part where you plug your charger in. Luckily, the piece can be replaced in the Kindle Fire. You just have to find a technician who can repair it or Amazon may have a repair plan."
is there a hiss with this mic???,"Hey, I haven't really heard one yet, but if your camera has a 3.5mm headphone jack, don't use the included 1/4"" to 3.5mm adapter because it is cheap and it may make some noise. You can purchase a quality adapter on eBay, Amazon, or Radio Shack. Hope this helps!! ;)"
"Will this work with phantom, or does it require a battery?",It does require a AA battery.
Can I plug this into my computer and use Audacity to record the audio?,"Yes, you can. I actually have done it several times. As long as you have a Mic input in your PC there shouldn't be any problem."
Will this work with Nikon cameras?,Yes it works with nikon cameras
Does it work with canon vixia r52 camcorder?,I'm using it with a Vixia R500 which is basically the same camera. Works surprisingly well for an inexpensive microphone. You will probably want to turn off the automatic gain control.
Would this work well as an affordable mic for a video interview show between two people with the mic offscreen?,It's basically made for that exact purpose. It's perfect for interviews.
Will this mic work with an iPad 3?,No it wont
Is this a fake item like some reviews state ?,You get what you pay for. I used it once and leared my lesson.
Can I use a regular XLR cable to connect this to a mixer?,you would have to get an adapter from 1/8' (3.5mm) jack to XLR but that SHOULD work
Is the microphone compatible with a Sony Handycam HDR-CX560V?,"I do not own the camcorder (I prefer Canon), but a quick look at it on Amazon shows that it has a microphone input. This means that it will work. Due to the fact that camcorders have poor pre-amps, I would suggest getting a small dedicated voice recorder like the Zoom H1 with it and use that to record sound and sync it up in post production."
Does it include middle east maps ?,It supposed too
IS IT GOOD FOR A TRUCKER,this is navigate
we need to usa - canada - mexico?,OK
"Who makes the maps and how do I get updates??? Can I use 3rd party maps, like Google???",I order it for my frend . It is not mine. But i have seen only USA and Canada maps. I dont know if it is posible to use it anywhere else. Or may be update maps.
Can you run the GPS and the VIDEO RECORDER at the same time?,"Yes you can use the gps, while a video is being recorded in the background."
have russian voice,"Do not buy this , it is not good at all. I have one it did not work and it cost me $60 to send it back to chaina and i am not sure if i do that i get my money back, i wish you were here i will give it to you free."
it work with back up camera?,"This device is not good at all , I bought like this four month ago it did not work and when i want it to sent it back i had a hard time to convenience them eventually i gave up and i hung it up in my garage to remind (remember who you dealing with) I hope you will not need need to hung it up."
The power cable included is to feed 5v from another USB port on the laptop TO the ExpressCard adaptor for all but low pwr devices attached to adaptor?,I didn't need the power cable when using one external hard drive but I did need to hook up the power cable when I added a second external hard drive to the second USB 3.0 port on the card. The power coming through the card from my Dell E5510 notebook computer was not sufficient to power the two external hard drives (one was a Western Digital My Passport and the other was a Seagate Backup Plus).
"I have a dell xps m1330, The express card slot is 54mm on the outside and 34mm on the inside. will this fit? what are the dimensions of this card.","My micrometer says the card is 54mm wide at its widest, 34mm wide at its most narrow and just over 3/16"" (~5.2mm) thick."
Has anyone run across a 54mm Express Card to HDMI port? Or 54mm Express Card to video graphic card/GPU,http://www.techradar.com/news/computing-components/graphics-cards/how-to-make-an-external-laptop-graphics-adaptor-915616
I have transfer rates much slower than I would expect: 70 MB/s read 36 MB/s write. I believe I have all drivers up to date and latest firmware. Help,"Try the card in a few other computers, or different brands to figure out if the problem lies in the card itself. BTW, theoretical top speeds are never achieved in practice. See Wikipedia article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_device_bit_rates#mediaviewer/File:Speeds_of_common_interfaces.svg"
How long is the USB power cable that comes with this?,Can't say 100% but it was pretty short (less than 6 inches) I didn't need it
packing,"Mine came in a Box with a Installation CD. Depending on your Drive, you may or may not have problems installing."
I have successfully installed the Express card. How can I best avoid computer bottlenecks to verify its speed?,"I got about 300 MB/s, which is about half of the max speed but it was plenty fast. If you are connecting the USB 3 wire to an external USB 3 hard disk, and not doing hard disk intensive work on your main OS drive, I think you will get about the same rate of transfer speed while moving large files. Good luck!"
Which driver do I need to install from the CD for a computer running Windows 8.1?,Not sure for windows 8.1 you can always install all of them. It wont hurt the computer and it will only end up using the one it needs.
There are 7 driver folders on the disc included. Which folder applies to this part? There are no part numbers on the card itself .....,Use the USB3.0 NEC720202(01) folder.
is it compatible with the dell lattitude c610 laptop?,"I would think so, but not sure. Works in my Dell Inspiron E1705 just fine."
How long is the connection cord? My PC is under the desk.,Should be longer enough to reach. It sounds like you have the same setup that I do and I had enough cord to hook up
is it compatible with GMAIL,I see no reason it wouldn't be compatible with gmail.
Is this compatible with the Linus platform and does it have a speaker?,"I do not know about the linus platform, but it does not have a speaker. It does have a microphone and the focus is adjustable."
does it come with all the parts or do you have to buy all the parts by them self,It comes with everything you need to install and use immediately.
where is microphone,"If you use a magnifying lens, you can see a small thin horizontal slot in the front of the unit just below the two small push buttons. The slot is centered on the spot where the two push buttons meet, and a fraction of an inch (about 1 mm) just below them. That is the microphone input area, and the microphone itself is just behind the slot inside the camera unit. The camera itself has a view hole whose diameter is the same as the microphone slot height (i.e. a pinhole) that is horizontally in-line with the microphone slot, and about half way toward the LED indicator. Both are itty bitty devices, but they have worked well for me, and the small size prevents most dust and dirt buildup. It's pretty much the same technology as used on smart phones, but the camera is much lower resolution due to the real-time transmission constraints of a video call so it doesn't have or need a lens."
does it work with Google hangout?,"Yes, it will work with Google hangout and Skype"
Is it compatible with WIN8?,"Hi Ziqi, I have a Win8 and it connected in two seconds. Great quality too."
Is this just for laptops or can it be used on desk tops as well,"We use it with our desktop:). We love it, works great!"
will it work with windows 8,It will probably work. it is a very good webcam
Is this compatible with apple computers?,No
"Does this come with the power cord that connects to a USB port? It's not shown in the pictures. Also, is eSATA supposed to be faster than USB 2 or 3","The product description lists a power cord is included. It is more important that this comes with a mini CD with the correct drivers. I have purchased three of these pci-express cards with USB 3.0 and with and without eSATA. The USB3.0 and eSATA ports I/O speed is limited by the pcie bus. USB3.0 should be faster than the pcie bus but you must remember that there are several controller and bridge chips between the storage device and the computer. The all can add overhead and bottle necks. In my testing I have found the max Read/Write speeds to be 70-120MBps for USB3.0 and eSATA. The eSATA is temperamental and I only use for backup. The max Read/Write speeds I get for USB2.0 are 30-40MBps. So this card is useful to use an open pci-express slot to add USB3.0/eSATA ports that are 2X-3X faster than your USB2.0. As far as power, I have not had to use the external power for accessing USB3.0 HDDs or SSDs. I have found huge variations in I/O speeds between different external enclosures with the same drives installed. I say go for it if you have an empty slot and only USB2.0 and also consider a dual USB3.0 unless you require eSATA. One answer referred to unstable behavior on a laptop. That is caused by the driver. The USB/eSATA card uses a different driver than the dual USB card. The included driver may not be the best for your PC, but there is probably a better driver somewhere.."
Has anyone run across a 54mm Express Card to HDMI port? Or 54mm Express Card to video graphic card/GPU,"I haven't seen that, I'm not sure why. Maybe due to the fact that many laptops nowadays have HDMI or DisplayPort. You could just get an adapter for your VGA or DVI, whichever you've got. Good chance you wont be able to get 1080 from it though. There are a lot of USB to HDMI external adapters, that might be the simplest solution for you."
did anyone try eSata port on this card? I'm not able to find tech support of this manufacturer online. I would like to ask them a few questions.,"Google the manufacturer and model name for drivers. And do the same for forums. That's what I did. You can find different driver packages but I believe as far as my last search went nearly a year ago, the maufacturer's latest drivers at that time were beginning to solve lingering user issues. Most reported good success though not necessarily the bandwidth specified, though still rewarding. Time has passed so a search should yield even newer drivers. I have not had a chance to actually install mine, but I look forward to it.. I think anyway.. by what I did read about driver developments."
Does the eSATA port support Port Multiplication?,"I was not successful getting it to work so far. I've tried the supplied driver, used the Windows 7 plug and play driver, neither recognizes it. It was under $10, so I'm not going to try to mail it back to China, now sits in the bottom of a drawer and I'm just using my USB 2 ports instead of trying to add a USB 3 and/or eSATA ports. When I have a hour to kill, I may try installing it again, but faster to just use USB 2. You get what you pay for..."
Where can I download the driver for this device ???. The controller sent does not work !!!,that really not work....is a head ache...... really.
will this chip work for the wd-65734 65 inch dlp,"Ellen, I cannot guarantee that it will work on the WD-65734 model. However, in the Product Description section of this item, your model is listed as one of the TV's that this chip was made for. The product description was what I used to determine whether or not I was going to purchase this DLP chip in July 2013. I had the same worry as you do, as I did not see any other reviews with my Mitsubishi model number. Nevertheless, I made the purchase, CAREFULLY FOLLOWED 2 different YouTube videos and my TV has been dot free for the last 5 months. Hope this helps......a little. -Kid Scott"
some people say change the bulb first for pixal issue. And my tv bulb like is also blinking. Does anyone thing this is an alternative that may be worth trying. Considering the amount for the chip/,"From the experience of my tv,which had numerous and increasing white and black screen dots,the replacement of the dip chip was the solution.Replacement resulted in an exquisite picture once again,as good as original.My bulb indicator lite was not blinking which is expected in this case-it was missing pixels on my screen,the bulb and screen illumination was fine.If your bulb indicator lite is blinking,go ahead and replace the bulb.If the bulb indicator lite is on and you also have white or black dots on your screen,you must replace both.You might as well replace the bulb if you end up replacing the Chip as the extent of disassembly required to replace the chip makes it a no brainer. Watch a ShopJimmy YouTube video for step by step replacement."
where can i find the corrct chip,"Call Mitsubishi and give them your model number and serial number. They might help you with the repair even if it is out of warranty. If you buy the chip yourself, only buy the newest revised version. DLP DMD Dark Chip 4. A ""W"" at the end of the model number of the chip indicates the newest revised version. The newest version is suppose to fix the dot issue problem forever. It will never occur again. That is what a repair shop told me."
"Lots of white dots in my WD60C9 , does this chip work for my model? Thanks!",I do not know. I believe you would have to look that one on the chip description using your model number. My son and husband installed the chip and the dots were gone.
Will this chip work on TV model WD-Y657 serial 109104,Worked for five months
I just replaced the chip but I now have a horizontal black bar across the screen. What could cause that issue?,"I guess its normal. It happens to everyone. I called the chip maker and they told me to remove it and reinstall. I guess it has to energize. I took it out , put it back in and the picture was better than new. so the response is to remove it and then reinstall. You'll feel like a professional came in and did it. Had my ipad on the side of me and youtube on the install of the chip and in less than a half hourm done dealmlet me know how you make out."
im having isssues with my chip?????,"Not sure what ""issues"" exactly means. But the vendor does give a waranty on the chip. Just contact them."
Is this a genuine Mitsubishi chip or an off brand?,Yes this genuine .I have not had any problems with this chip. It was very straight forward and simple to install.
Will this chip work with Mitsubishi WD65737?,Yes
"Hi, will this work with WD-73835 DIAMOND series? Also, how difficult is it to install the chip myself? Thank you",At the bottom of the listing is a list of all tvs it will work on and that one is listed. Very easy to install but if you go to bing and search for how to install chip in that tv it will bring up several videos on how to. You will need a drill and a long phillips bit.
"I have a koolertron c cage camera rig, can I mount this jib directly to my rig or will it only support my camera?","Its all about the weight balance on this one...the heavier the front end, the heavier the back end should be to counter balance ...however I never tried to hook up a rig to it as of yet....but I believe its possible."
Which is a good monitor to use with this on the canon D5 mark 3?,"Hello. I've only got the one Liliput monitor, but it should work well with your camera. It has multiple types of outputs including HDMI, Component, RCA composite. Also has audio, too. It displays in true HD, up to 1080, if I recall correctly. Here's the link to it on Amazon. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041I8UAO/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1"
I'm new so pardon me. Does the DSLR stay mounted at the tip of the jib? I initially thought you could slide it back and forth down the jib too.,"No, it stays on top of the jib. When it would be possible to slide it, in some cases the track would be visible in the video I think."
"What is the shortest length you can use is as. I seen in videos that its 3 long bars to connect, can you use just to use 2 instead?","Yes, you can use just 2 sections as a 8ft crain.."
Can you break this down so you can store it easier? or will you just have an 8ft crane laying around when you arent using it?,"Yes, You Can Break It Down, Check Out My YouTube Video Of Me Putting It Together https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WTJcRHSqks"
How much does the crane weigh? And how much weights are recommended to stabilize it?,"Dont have exact weight of the crane but its not heavy, especially when in its individual components. The amount of weight you'll use to balance depends on what you're putting on the end. I use mine with a Canon 5D typically. 2 5-pound weights is plenty. Had a RED digital cinema camera on it for a day and that required 20 pounds."
What's the heaviest camera this crane will support?,Up to 8 lbs. http://www.proamusa.com/ProAm-USA-Orion-DVC200-8-Camera-Crane-Jib-p/dvc200.htm
"Can you tilt the camera so the lens points all the way down (for overhead shots, or shots of a table for example)",Not if the camera is directly mounted to the plate. I mounted an additional tripod head to allow any desired camera angle.
can this jib exceed 12'' in length?,"Do not attempt to extend the length of this jib. The legs on the stand are not wide enough to support the added mass without the jib toppling, and adding sandbags to the stand will run the risk of damaging the legs. For anything longer, you may want to consider a Kessler Crane jib, or one of the other higher priced jibs designed for such work. Keep in mind, there's also the weight of the camera which gets magnified many times, the longer the jib boom is, and that means more weight on the counter balance end. ProAm will not honor warranties under situations like this."
"I see people talking about a tilt tool, and a base within the questions. Can i get some direct links of what is recommended to purchase with the crane","I would recommend a sturdy tripod with heavy duty head, or something similar. I've used this with my regular tripod and fluid head and it worked, but it was not sturdy. I eventually got a heavy duty speaker stand and custom made a mount for it with hardware from Lowe's. Although the jib crane is not that heavy, by the time you get the counter balances (I used small 2 and 5 lb weights for exercise) on and are moving the thing around it needs a strong base."
Plugged in to the usb port of a PC will I get Audio output,Yes
Can I use it to transfer music (i.e.sound) from LPs (records) and cassette tapes to a laptop or PC?,If the turntable or cassette player are not plug and play devices recognizedvby your computer it won' t matter what is used to connect it.
do this work for connecting a lap top and older t.v.?,"No. USB adapters only transfer data (files like documents, pictures, etc.). This product will not project your computer screen, no matter the age of the TV. In fact, I have no idea why a product like this was ever made. Do not purchase it."
Does this work with tablets?,"I don't no, I don't have tablet, but this work with laptop."
will this cable work from my karaoke machine to the laptop? If not- do you know of a cable that will work?,"It will possibly work , but not the best quality."
Does it work with DVD/VCR player and WIIs,i could not get it to work. did not try long
Is this copper wire or copper coated aluminum wire?,"It's copper coated aluminum. Bad miss leading advertisement. It's ok for the short run, but I wouldn't recommend for the performance use."
Is this wire OFC?,I do not recall seeing any designation on the box for oxygen free cable.
Is the wire itself stamped with a UL Approval?,"I used this wire in my house. It is stamped ""CM/CL2"" on the wire every few feet."
howdo I install sound box,Wht ever ur sound is hooked up to it has output plug bc it receives the input to produce the sound. Usually straight from tv it would br tv output either hdmi or RCA cables. Hope that helps
Where are the dimensions?,"40"" long, 6"" high, 4"" deep (all approx)"
Does it have optical input?,Yes it does and this sound bar works really good.
What is the warrenty on this?,"Mine was refurbished ($54). Regular price was $129.99. Mine came from MoneySavingDeals but was fulfilled by Amazon Prime. Amazon Prime is a special class of Amazon service with free 2 day shipping. $79 a year to belong. The 3rd party seller had a 30 day warranty on this item I believe but whenever your purchase is fulfilled by Amazon prime returns are a snap. Don't have to talk to anybody. Just print up the pre-paid return UPS label. I got mine April 2nd. It looks brand new and works perfectly. The ones on the Amazon site now are not from MoneySavingDeals, and have a delivery charge. I would wait for one on Amazon Prime if you are a member. Hope this helps. tommytomted"
There is a rattling sound with the slightest table/desk vibration such as when moving the mouse. How do I stop this?,"Totally abnormal; virtually unheard of in a monitor. I would contact the manufacturer, as it surely must be returned/replaced under warranty."
what is the total height,"Total height when extended from bottom of the stand to the top edge of monitor is 19""......when pushed all the way down the distance is 17.5"".......Best monitor I've ever had, beautiful picture, my 1st widescreen. My previous one was also Viewsonic, had it for 9 yrs, never really wore out just took longer & longer to light up, then OK."
what is the total height,"At its lowest position, the top of the monitor is 16.5"" from the desk. When I extended it upward to its fullest extent, it measures 22"" from the desk to the top of the monitor. Hope this helps."
iMac 27 compatible as a second monitor?,"Yes it would be. You can use either a displayport to mini displayport cable, or since it is only 1080p, you can use an adapter."
display port hookup,It has a display port and it even comes with a display port cable too.
What is the height when adjusted to the tallest position?,9 3/8 to the bottom and will clear 22 1/2 at the top so just shy 22.5 at the top - high position low position is 4 inch clearing bottom to 17 1/8 top
"Can you work on two applications side by side on this, like you can with dual monitors?",You can simply arrange two application windows. The monitor is wide enough to do this easily.
does this monitor work with a macbook,"It has video inputs for VGA, Digital, and Display port, so if you have native options on the mac book for these, then yes it will work. Otherwise you will need some adapter."
"Does this monitor come with a cable to connect it to a Mac Air? And if not, can you tell me which one I need to buy? Thanks!","Yes, this monitor does come with a cable, however, I don't know if it connect to a Mac Air."
"How high is the stand, desktop to base of the monitor? And what is its adjustable range in inches?",At lowest the bottom of the monitor is 4 inches from the desktop and it will raise up 5 inches making it 9 inches at the highest. Raising it is simply lifting the screen or pushing it down with your hands. I works great.
"Dell LatitudeE6410- want to use the multimode DisplayPort . The one cable drive both audio and video for this 24""? Thanks to 2-2 -13 for review.","The VG2439M does handle audio passthrough over DisplayPort....BUT the monitor does not have built in speakers. So if you have speakers that you would keep plugged into the back of the monitor, then yes, you only have the one cable driving both audio and video."
Will this key work for a Camry 2012???,"Hi Vim, This key for only for models (Camry) from 2002-2006. For 2012 models you have different transponder chip."
Is this a master key,Yes
how to fix for avalon 2002,My car was a Sequoia '02.
Will this key work for a 2000 Toyota Avalon?,"Yes, based on product information it should work for 2000 Toyota Avalon. Good luck."
would this key work for me.on 2002 sienna?,I don't know about Sienna. it worked on Avalon
does this key has toyota logo on it,Yep
Will this work for a 1999 Avalon?,Yes
Does this work for a 2005 Toyota Prius?,It worked great for a 1998 Toyota Camry but we had to call customer service and get help from them for programming...you need to make sure the dimensions are exactly the same as your key and if it is then it's worth taking it to a locksmith and paying $4.00 to have it cut. The Toyota dealer wanted $100 which is 90 percent more than I paid...if it doesn't work you're out about $10.
does ignition key blank work on 04 sienna,"I dont know, it work on my toyota camry"
will this key work on my camry LE 06? what if not working?,If it is listed. it will work. I have to say I ordered 2 keys for my car and it works perfect. Was for 2001 Toyota Sequoia. take 2min to work. I have saved over $200.
Will a 36 volt work on a 48 volt?,"no, voltage has to be the same."
"I have a 36 volt system , will this converter work on my cart",Look for the 36v version. It should be the same price or close.
didn't get information to in stall,36v or 48v side hooks to red to controller @ battery and ground to Blk @ battery going to motor (you will get sparks its normal) 12v hooks to accessories your adding. Should be marked on back36/ 48v & 12v or- in 36/48v- out 12v
will this work to convert 48 v system so i can install a 12 v set of head lights,"Yes, that is what I used it for."
Do you have a circuit diagram so I can verify the protection circuitry inside the unit?,No
concerning the 12v + / - where is the best place to locate the negative wire on the 12v side?,The voltage reducer if it is the 48 V to 12V one is designed to go across all batteries. Therefore you connect the positive side to the positive terminal on one end of the battery system and the negative on the negative terminal at the other end of the battery series. If you have 8V batteries there should be 6 batteries hooked up in series between the negative and positive connections.
Does it work for an 2008 Club Car precedent?,"There are 2 different voltage reducers available, one for a 48 volt cart and the other for a 36 volt cart. You need the one that matches the voltage of your cart. If you are unsure what the voltage of your cart is, measure the voltage of one of the batteries and multiply by the number of batteries. The total voltage may be a volt or two above the 36 or 48 volt level. For instance, a good set of 8 volt batteries that are fully charged will measure around 50 volts. You want the voltage reducer closest to the total. I hope that this helps!!!"
"I would like to see a wiring diagram, can anyone help?","There really isn't a wiring diagram. There are 4 wires, each clearly marked. The four wires are +48 VDC In (+ side of battery array), Ground in (- side of battery array), +12 VDC Out and GND (-) Out. Connect the input side to your battery array and the output side to whatever 12 volt device you need to power. Keep in mind that there is a 10 Amp limit, which should be plenty for most applications, but something to be aware of."
Can this be used to charge a 12v battery?,"No, this is not a charger, it reduces the voltage from a 48 volt battery pack to 12 volts so that 12 volt accessories use all the batteries equally."
Can I connect this unit to a 48VDC battery set and reduce and achieve 12VDC to power a car radio system?,"Yes, depending on how many amps it draws. If you have lights or other accessories you would have to go with a more substantial converter."
is it made in japan and or china,China
does a memory card come with it?,"No, it does not come with a memory card."
Is a separate battery charger included?,yes. the cord that connects the camera to the computer to transfer pictures doubles as a battery charger. the cord plugs into an ac adapter that you than plug into a regular power outlet to charge the camera.
Does anyone know if this is the same system I see on other sites (like Crutchfield) for $599? Or is it an older/different model? Thanks!,It's the exact same system. The average price at most sane retailers is in the $350 to $370 range. Crutchfield and Tiger Direct will gladly overcharge you an additional $200 dollars for the honor of buying it from them. It's a fantastic sound system and the subwoofer rattles the windows in my home!
What else will i need to go with this system? i see people mentioning recievers.,"Firstly, these are great speakers for an average size room. I have them installed in my family room and they are terrific. Many people hook them up to a ""receiver"" (which can do a number of things). Mine is a Onkyo through which everything is ""processed."" The Onkyo has inputs/outputs for my (old tech) VCR, my DVD, my Netflix input and my DirectTV cable box. It also has an AM/FM receiver built in and is remotely controlled. Switching from mode to another is simple and painless. The output from the Onkyo goes directly to my LCD TV, my speakers and back to the VCR (yes I still have one) for recording. So, in sum, if you buy a TV, the speakers and a receiver/amp you're in business. A Sony BluRay (with built-in Netflix, Hulu, etc.) is really inexpensive and also a necessary as far as I am concerned. Hope this helps."
"Are the speakers 4, 6 or 8 ohm?","The five passive modular speakers are 8 ohm. I don't know what the sub-woofer is, but since its an active sub-woofer (has it's own built in amplifier) I don't think it will matter."
Speakers are smaller than comparative systems like energy classics. Will this system fill my 20x16 living room with great sound?,Yes it will... Although they are small but the quality and crispness of the speakers comes through. You can increase the output of speakers to fit a 28x20 hall. That's what I have... Klipsch hasn't disappointed me and honestly I am impressed.
Hi there. Is it compatible with Sony STRDN850 and STRDN750?,Absolutely! You can use the Klipsch speakers with either Sony and they will sound great. Sony has an excellent manual with diagrams for speaker set ups. You can download it from Sony to check it out before ordering your speakers and receiver.
how wide and tall are the four speakers?,"approx 6.0"" high 3.5"" wide"
Do the speaker wire connector clips seem durable and hold the speaker wire in place well?,"Yes , mine are hanging from the ceiling and have been in place for almost 6months."
are the rear speakers wireless?,No they are not. If you can run wire in the wall there is a way to have them appear wireless with the brackets they provide. I also ordered a nicer bracket that I decided not to use because of visible wire
What gauge wire did you use? The discription is a bit confusing and I'm not sure if 14 awg is OK or not. Thanks!,14 would be fine. Im running 14 with banana plugs with no issues.
Anyone know what the frequency range of the speakers are? Both total range and how far it can get a flat response?,"There are many things to consider when asking the ""frequency range"" of the speaker are. Firstly, this is not a ""Cadillac"" system, but it is an extremely good value. Placement of the speakers, what you are hooking them up to, and the size of the room all affect frequency range. I suggest you read this article, which should answer your questions, regarding this extremely excellent system - http://www.digitaltrends.com/speaker-reviews/klipsch-hd-theater-600-review/"
Does this connect via USB 3.0 or USB 2.0?,USB 2.0
Does anyone know if my mac does not had enough power for this drive if it is possible to use an external power supply for the second input instead of using 2 outputs from my computer?,I bought this drive for my macbook pro. I only plug in one of the usb inputs into the computer and it runs fine.
Will this Copy Blu-Ray 3D media as well as burn it?,"It reads and writes Blu-Ray just live DVD. To copy, I'm assuming you mean rip, it would depend on software compatibility and protections placed on the disk itself. For example, you could easily copy information over from an unprotected data disk but probably would not be successful trying to rip a copyrighted movie, but then I've never tried."
If I connect to an laptop pc does it require its own driver? I would not want to use the suite right now. Also does with work with a Macbook Pro 2011,"It's just plug and play. I have a 2011 mac book pro and have use this drive several times with no issues. Just remember that macs don't have native Blu-ray playback. You'll see the disk mount, and you can even burn to recordable disks. But you will need 3rd party software to play movies. There is free stuff out there if you google it."
Can this also burn music CDs?,Yes it can
Does anyone have warranty information?,According to the BuffaloTech Website the warranty is two years.
Does this connect via USB 3.0 or USB 2.0?,USB 2.0
Will this play all region Blu-Ray &amp; DVDs?,"Upon first plugging the player into my computer, I was asked to choose a region, and was told that I could change the region up to 5 times. So it will play disks from all regions, but you'll want to be careful how often you switch back and forth, as upon the fifth change, you'll be stuck with that region permanently (apparently)."
Does this burn dual layer DVDs?,"Yes, it does burn dual layer DVDs. I have burned three so far."
Is this LTH Compatible?,"Sorry, am unsure even after looking at the Verbatim website ( http://www.verbatim.com/subcat/optical-media/blu-ray/lth/ ), still am unsure to say with any certainty, I'd be just guessing"
"As an outdoor player for a show, will this this radio handle rain splashes and the cold of winter if top covered like an umbrella ?",Yes as long it is not in a down pour.
Help an old geezer out here...what is the purpose of being able to plug in an iphone? Just charging it?,Just to output the audio into the radio so it is louder. You cannot charge the iPhone with the radio.
Does it come with the rechargeable batteries or do you have to buy them seperately?,separately
Can a device be plugged into the AUX but be listening to the radio? I want to leave a player in the AUX and be able to switch over to FM w/o unpluggi,yes
What is a good brand of rechargeable C batteries to buy with this radio?,Tenergy 5000mh 1.2 v C rechargesble.
can it be plugged into a cigarette lighter???,No it can't. The radio requires 110V to operate. The radio will play for at least 16 hours on a charge if you buy the 4 C rechargeable batteries which charge when the radio is plugged in. If your car has 110v inverter it will work.
Can I connect this to a speaker using AUX so it plays on a speaker outside? Or is it just AUX in? Can it be AUX out too? Thanks.,"I am not sure. There is a port that says AUX on the side of it. I plugged in some headphones to it, but no sound came out of them. May only be aux in. The speaker quality is not that good...too much vibration and distortion on one station I like. Might be able to find something better for less $ with the options you desire."
We'd like to buy it for Europe (continental) and wondering whether there are any incompatibilities on its usage.,"I am uncertain about whether the plug - 3 prong-would work with an adapter. It operates on 120 volts, which may be different from EU current. It has both am & fm channels."
how heavy is product?,Not bad. Would not take backpacking but good for any other type. Guess 2-3 pounds
"besides color and able to recharge batteries, what is the difference between the LB100 and TB100 especially in the sound department?","Not sure about sound of LB100 but the sound of the TB100 isn't very good , to much bass"
Does anyone know if this is a unidirectional/cardioid microphone? I'd like to use it with Dragon Dictate for Mac.,"Omni directional Omni directional Omni directional. Well, I just tried saying the word omni directional from three different points around the microphone tip. It picked up perfectly each time. I couldn't find it stated anywhere which type of microphone pattern it is. But from what other reviewer's have reported... being across the kitchen room and it still picking up clearly using Skype, I don't think you're going to have a problem using the microphone in any orientation. I have used it for 85% of all emails, messages and texts on my iMac since I got it around Christmas"
long long is the plug,"From tip of USB to base is approx. 45"". If you need a longer cord, you can buy a USB male/female cable in 4ft, 6ft, etc lengths. For example: AmazonBasics USB 2.0 A-Male to A-Female Extension Cable (9.8 Feet/3.0 Meters) by AmazonBasics $5.99"
"I'm looking for something I can set in the middle of the room, stand about 5-8 feet away and still be able to talk clearly. Whats the distance?",Distance is only 1 feet
does it work with ps4?,No
Does this mic have any static/hiss/buzz?,I don't have a problem with this. I use it in a classroom to capture the lecture and class discussion.
work with Dragon naturally speaking?,If it works as well as the one I bought no
Can I get country of origin on this item,"China, I believe, but it is imported from Britain"
Can you use this around a desktop keyboard without the microphone picking up the keyboard noises ?,"it depends how loud your keyboard is, and how close it is to the keyboard. but if you have a machanical keyboard then i would say almost any mic will pick up your keyboard\"

"My laptop has VGA output and my HD TV has a DVI-D input that have an adapter to accept HDMI from my satellite, will this device work if I connect it to the adapter? The TV is DVI-D not DVI-I.","I wouldn't think you even need it. Just buy a vga to dvi-d adapter, they cost about $5. (Remember, you will need a separate cable for sound.)"
I have a droid Razor with a HDMI output. I have successfully hooked up to my TV's HDMI input. Will this allow my droid razor to talk with a projector?,I would agree with Jan K. This is a VGA to HDMI. I think I have seen HDMI to VGA converters in my my search though.

"Currently I am running a vga from pc to projector, picture is great!

will this product display small print so I can use my tv as a monitor ?,"all image that is in the laptop using a vga cable is going to project in the tv.

I don't know what version of Windows you have, but if you go CONTROL PANEL - DISPLAY and change the settings for the display resolution. If you have it set too high, you may not get a signal."
I have an old desktop computer with no hdmi port and a tv with hdmi port can this converter allow me to view movies from my old computer?,"My laptop is about 5 years old. I went on ebay and bought a VGA cable that had the audio jack (3.5mm plug) atached to it. I used this from the VGA jack on my laptop to the converter, and plugged the audio jack into the head phone jack and into the converter. My picture on the TV is pretty good, I would say around a 8 1/2 to 9 right now. I just bought the LCD TV and am still tweaking in the picture part of it. Hope this helps."
Will a 4:3 input stretch to a 16:9 image or will the aspect ratio stay the same with black bars on each side?,The resolution of the VGA signal can be set to make the picture looks either like a 4:3 picture or a 16:9 image (also depends on whether your HDTV is a 720p or 1080p). Some autoformat function on your TV might be able to stretch enough but you may still see portions of the black bars on both side of the screen if it is a 4:3 video.

does it really do 1080P out of a USB port? I didn't think usb2.0 had the bandwidth to do it.,"These products are well established. It can get choppy on some video playback because all processing is done by the CPU, but since it only refreshes the portion of the screen it is usually workable for ad-resolution video and other browsing, I tested a similar product and own a few of these USB 2.0 adapters -- you need a beefy CPU to handle 1080p video."
"Will it plug into a USB 2.0 port on a G4 PowerPC Mac, and convert the signal for using an HDMI monitor?",I dont have MAC but my roommate connects to HDMI TV using this cable USB connection and audio through his bluetooth wireless speaker.

I have a ID MK4 and will only use EF mounts even with the 1.3 sensor. Just looking at the lenses that are full manual film lenses, they look like they will work.
