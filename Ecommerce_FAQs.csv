WHERE DOES IT GO ON 1990 ACCORD,"At the leaf spring on the axle itself. Lost one spring due to driving over a curb. Had to buy another set. They really hold up to their weight, but not to the axle."
does it fit a 2014 odessey,"on leif springs , it goes between axle and spring, on coil springs ,Dodges, you can't use the u bolts, there is a rubber attachment on body that coil fits, then bolt from top with bar, you will have to drill hole in bar and bolt to rubber from top."

these ball joints adjustable for front end alignment ?,"Yes,  These are very easy to install.  Just make sure you tighten U-bolt nuts evenly and stay clear of the brake lines."
does this come with the air line kit?,They are reasonably easy to install.  You need to jack the truck up by the frame on each side to make room to install the springs between the axle and the frame and make sure you do not leave the steel brake lines underneath the u-bolts.  I am a retired ASE Master Mechanic but it does not require that kind of experience to install these properly.  Hope that helps.
for the Monroe 37203 the sell is a the pair or single sense absorber?,Very easy to install with basic skills...your vehicle needs to be jacked up a bit to fit the spring between the frame and axle...then put the clamps  (!check to see that the brake lines is NOT under the clamps!) tighten the clamps and lower the vehicle. Your ready for some Dukes of Hazzard style jumps...just kidding...besides you would need a 69 Charger.
Is this for the front or rear,Very easy
Is this backing plate for a9inch or a 10inch,Yes they were easy to install.  I needed to buy bigger U bolts for my particular truck but they were easy to install.  I take mine on and off as needed.
2010 Corolla LE 1.8 liter?,Very simple to install. But I did find it easier to get one nut put on the U clamps and then cut the extra length of the U clamps based off of that new measurement.  So that your not having to spend 30 mins trying to thread the nuts on because the U clamps are universal to fit other trucks. Plus I like the load it can handle and unlike an add a leaf set I like how it doesn't change the vehicles handling.
Who makes this sensor please,"yes they just go on the axle and a ubolt bolts them onto the axle,very easy"
is the stock one 2 or 3 row? and is this the same?,Easy to install but you need large u-bolts and plates to set the coil spring good

im looking for the rear wiper or refill for a 2008 entorauge.,I understand your concern. I have sidelined these mirrors for a different set which I like better and attach real well on the outside mirrors. These are not the typical tpe that rubber band on. Also with the CIPA 11650 was a wind noise from the strap.
Did you see an increase in MPG over a reasonable length of time?,"No problem with water, these are the best. a little vibration, but not enough to be of concern..I did put those little bullet mirrors on it for added view. You won't find a better deal, unless you spend $38,000 for a new truck with real hauling mirrors built in....."
What is the mix ratio for 5 gal of gas?,We drove for several hours in the rain last week and we had no water in the doors. Hope this helps
does it fit the mazda b 3000 bed?,The small amount of water slipping thru the gaps will drain out of weep holes installed on the bottom of the doors.  So this should be no problem.

Will these fit on a 2006 Toyota Tacoma?,It may if you have a straight wedge
"does it come with the tube, or just what it shows on the picture?",These are adjustable and should work on just about any vehicle.  I use them my GMC Acadia. I like them because they're so easy to put on; and they stay secure. Very little vibration.
Are these mirrors power and will they work with memory functions?  Do they have the turn signal indicator built into the glass or case?,"Since I don't have an 89 Chevy Pickup I can't say for sure however, looking at the design, it should work on most pickups. I'm really happy with my set of two."
Are these genuine Mobil 1 oil filters?  The discount from retail is enough to get me worried whether they are real Mobil1 or not.,"Steve, not for sure about the 1989 Pick-up, but I switch mine back and forth from the 1994 Dodge 2500 and the 2008 Nitro with ease. I did add a 12"" piece of 1/2 in pvc to the downleg to get the mirrors level on the big truck."
"I need a window motor for the driver side rear door. Will this work? If not, what is the exact item I need?","I have them for my 1972 GMC, and They will work on your '89 I'm sure of that."
Will this sensor work on both right and left upstream or pre- cat position,"I don't see why not. The lateral top mount hooks over the ledge where the door window rolls up and down from, while the bottom strap with clip extends down the door panel and hooks under it at the base, ratcheting it taunt. What keeps it sturdy and in position is the pressure from the window glass on top so you may not want these if you like to drive with your windows completely down. They are designed to put on then off when not towing. There are other more permanent options available for US trucks as I recall when searching for towing mirrors for my 06 Tundra. Good luck."
What size Metric Bolt is used?,I don't know
will the air bags fit a 2005 dodge ram 1500 4 dr. 4x4 short box.,I use the mirrors on my 2009 Envoy.  They hook on the door at the window and the bottom of the door. I believe they will work on any vehicle door.  And the extension arm allows for great visibility down both sides of my travel trailer.  Hope this is helpful.
will this work on my 2012 Ram with the spray on bed coating?,"I expect that these mirrors will work on any vehicle with a non-fixed or hard sealed drivers or passenger window.  In other words,  this mirror clips into the window seal or track at the bottom of the window and the adjustment strap clips to the bottom of the door.  I am using these mirrors on a 2003 Ford Explorer Sport Trac, and they also fit on my Tacoma, and F-250."
Will these fit a 2003 Tahoe?,"You have to order one for each side.  By the way, these mirrors provide much better vision than the fender mounts."
What is the thickness of these materials and all your other gaskets,Need to order two although they are interchangeable side to side
What is the maximum lift height and does this jack have a plastic carrying case?,"Single unit, order 2 if you need one for each side."
Do i need this strut boot for the complete Sensen Shock Struts (i.e both the front and the rear)?,"This is a single unit. You would have to order 2, but it's worth it, if like us you can't use the ones that mount on the wing mirrors."

Would this shift knob fit a Toyota Tacoma PreRunner?,"When you loosen  frame to take it off, you only have to give it an inch of slack.  It will then go on easily and can be tightened to where it needs to be.  It helps to pad strap where it contacts door to avoid wind vibration and friction."
I have a 2004 Z71 1500 Suburban. Will this fit the Z71 model???,"I just lay them in the storage compartment of my camper.  I make sure they're sitting on top of anything else that might be in there.  2 years later, they are still fine."
I know it's not listed but will this fit my 2003 silverado? I bought it and forgot to check the years it would fit,I just loosen the strap which frees it from the door and just wrap them to keep from getting scratched and store it in our travel trailer when not using them.

I have a 1993 Dodge Dynasty 3.3 liter 6 cyl engine will this battery work with my car?,"I'm sure some people do recommend using a relay,however I did not use one ,and it still works GREAT! Very Loud,would buy again."
will this fit a 2012 F-150 SVT Raptor?,just wire through the switch
Do these boot fit true to size?,I have replaced old horns on a Yamaha motorcycle.  I tested the sound of the new ones right of the battery and they worked just fine.

"I just want to be sure, does it come with the ball joint?",Probably lowest number. Mine quit after one year!
DOES IT FIT 2002 CHEVY TRAILBLAZER LTZ,"If you want the most decibels, buy the Wolo 419 Bad Boy Air Horn.  It is plenty loud.  These aren't incredibly loud, but if you use the Hi, and the Lo tone models, together, you will get plenty of noise.  Cheers!"

Thank you.,"12 volt.....but make sure you ask for the manuel (we didn't get one and had to wait for it to install it) and please note that the switch is NOT included with the pkg and must be ordered as well. However, we love it and are so glad we got it."
Does this fit a kawasaki 610?  If so what size small or medium?,Yes. 12.volt

Will this fit a 2014 Wrangler JK?,"Not sure what you are needing to know. The lower port on the back of the water heater is for the cold water supply. The upper port is for the hot water supply. If you need the water connections, the easiest way to do so is with shark bite fittings. Most campers come with 1/2"" pex type water line. You can get 1/2"" male shark bite fittings to make your connections. Make positively sure that you seat the water line to the bottom of the fitting or you will have a nice mess to clean up. When I install them, I use wirsbo aqua pex and my expander tool and appropriate fittings. However, if you do not have access to this it is expensive as the expander tool alone is $400.00. The shark bite fitting usually come in around $20.00. You will find the sharke bite fittings to be pretty easy, just make sure to seat them well as for warned.

audi,"It is easier then the old one.  When you take out the old one remember to take off the 90 degree elbow and use it on the bottom of the new one.  This way you will have more room to turn it in the back of the compartment, if it is as small as mine was.  The top line is hot and the lower line is cold.  There should be a cover plate in the back of your existing unit, you need to take it off to access the water lines, it is a tight fit.  One can be turned by hand, but the lower one (cold water) is a little difficult, you may have to use a wrench to get it to turn at first.  I hope that this helps and is what you are asking.  Good luck

Can this be used for a fuel pressure test at the Schrader valve?,we've had atleast three people shower consecutively without running out of hot water... the propane just kicks on and keeps heating the water as it is used... so i would say atleast a 20 minute shower but who needs that long

How many pieces Includes??? Id like to see real picture ... I wanted in color beige...,I don't know if it's the same unit....mine came with wiring intact and a door.
"will this fit my 2013, F150 four door crew cab.",The Attwood 6 gallon water heaters are basically the same size (G6A).  The final designation signifies whether or not it is a manual or automatic ignition.  Great products and the company stands behind all they manufacture.
"Since this is a washcloth, can I STILL use it with Meguiar's Ultimate Quik Wax? Or would that scratch my car?",Yes it did fit and work just like the original.  I had to fiddle with the exhaust port a bit so the cover would complete seal the external portion of the heater.
Will this work on a steel shipping container?,"If you look at the technical data on the one pictured you can measure the one you have and find out for certain. Atwood is one of the best on the market and don't change sizes on a whim like some others, so I would say it is a safe bet that yes it will."
Does it fit 2013 sport,Lorie--it sould work (same size) but we have the g6a-8E (electronic switch) so you will have to put in a switch. But it went right in & replaced the old one wire for wire. It was pretty easy for my husband to do with a little help from me holding it up!!

What is the total packed up size?   Does it pack small?   Fit in a saddle bag?   Maybe a large tool tube?,Mine came with the outer cover and a new control switch.

Some RV stores sell a water heater installation kit that includes the putty like sealer.  There is also a good utube video that takes you through the installation.  Watch them all and don't be afraid to do it.

does it work for baby camry toyota corolla 1995?,Everything. It is a complete unit ready for R&R.; I was very happy that it was an exact replacement for what I had and I didn't have to disassemble any parts from the old heater.
"You can put these on without taking the tire off or jacking the car up, correct?","The only thing you'll really need is wrenches, teflon tape and caulking tape for the seal."
"You can put these on without taking the tire off or jacking the car up, correct?","Yes they should be, the ones I received have the standard bananna end and plugged perfectly into my multimeter. I even tried plugging them into a table top power supply I have here also with the same and it worked perfectly. Now of course the next question would be does your multimeter use the standard socket to receive these  :-)  I'm sure it does, they are all pretty much standard these days. Hope that helps"
I bought 2 sensors 15290. Im ok to replace for a Toyota Corolla 2006 CE?.  Or i need an other kind?,"If your meter well except standard banana plugs, then these will work fine."

will these fit my chevy traverse 2010,"Well i'm just saying that the plugs aren't one of the right angle type that you'd find on most multimeters, they're the kind you might find on an iPod. They stick out about an inch straight out of the meter."
will it fit a 1100 1996 virago?,I would say they will because they are just banana plug ends. They fit my craftsman meter.
can I use this on the left rear of my 2001 sportster?  or is this just for the front?,#NAME?
How come they do not say anything about putting it on any automobile?,"Right around 0.16 inches, or about 5/32 inch. Hard to measure exactly, they are flexible and spring loaded."
Does this come with a rain cover?,The plug is 1/8 of an inch.  It has springs that extend out but are retracted when the plug is inserted in the receptacle.
"sizes run big?I need long sleeves like 35"" y or n",The ones that come with the meter are .125 or 1/8 of an inch. I hope this is of help to you.  Bill
Will these pads fit a 2005 BMW X5?,"To be honest, they are somewhat stiff. They are not like a loose coil which can be wrapped around or manipulated to suit a specific space. They have a bend from being folded for shipping, but they are not bendable like a coil."
Is this the Spice color?,"Not really, made of just normal plastics"
I need a pump for my bus - will this unit pump up a 12 inch tire bus tire in one go?,"The way mine are soldered I can't get to the bare wire to get an accurate measurement but the cable has 2x1.5mm^2 printed on it. I think that puts them at about AWG 14 or 15. That's also what I'd estimate by looking at them. However, since they don't list the gauge in the description it's possible that you'd get different wire on yours."

Will using this jumper cause damage to an electrical system/computer on newer cars e.g. 2008 Toyota Highlander?,"If the 1.5mm^2 on the covering does actually refer to wire size, that's between 16 and 17 AWG.  This would be pretty typical for light duty meter cables."
How thick is mat?,"The wire is labeled 18 gauge.  I was expecting a thicker gauge as well.  If there is any good news here, it is the better rated 600 V and 105 degree wire."

will they fit on a 2014 highlander LE,"36"""

where can i get a replacement remote,"It's a small gauge wire, I'm guessing 18 , so like the other guy said I wouldn't be putting a lot of amps on this no more than 3-5 amps, I bought these with my meter, the alligator clips help me out when clipping onto t-pins from back probing wires"
what is the total length of the clip,"It depends a lot on the application and duty cycle.  If you're running a continuous load, 4 A should be perfectly safe.  If you are running intermittent loads, I would not exceed 20 A, and only for short periods of time (feel the leads to see how quickly they warm up under higher loads).  These are meant for testing and prototyping, so odds are you probably aren't walking away from the area... but if you are away from the area that these are being used, it's best to make sure the loads do not exceed 4 A continuous."

The picture is of the Reese 51092 round tube hitch.  the title is for square tube.  Which is it?,"Our Shade is 21 1/2"" x 52"" and fits our mini cooper windsheild very well"
Is this the complete bumper with the tire carrier?,It fits perfect in my 2013 mini.
Will it fit a Softtail Deluxe,"I have a 2012 MINI Cooper S hardtop. I've always had to push a bit to get the shield behind the mirror. Once it's there, it fits perfectly."
Does the inside of the wheel have a gear that turns the sweeper?  And will it fit the 32 inch Agri Fab sweeper?,"Not sure about the 2014 MC. I have a 2009 MC, and the HeatShield does not have a cutout for the rear view mirror. I just pull it down a bit when putting it up and taking off."
Wiil this work with a set of refrigerant manifold guages to vacuum out a HVAC line set?,"Sam, I have a 2011 hardtop.

How do you add water to make ice cubes,This doesnt sound right. Mine fit fine.
is this the same product Amazon listed as 17930 for $15 more,I have a 2005 Mini Cooper and the sunshade fits normally. Not sure if there was a change in windshield design from 05 to 09. I'd contact vendor for an explanation.

"will these shocks work with a 3.5"" lift",I would think that it would. There haven't been any drastic changes to the build of the hard top.

Is this just the mirror housing or does it include the actual mirror glass?,It should fit since the sunshade fits my 2013 Mini hardtop.
will it fit 5.7 2014 tundra ?,The two brackets shown in front of the box can be attached to the bed of a truck if you choose to do so. When the box is open there are mechanisms that lock into the brackets.  They can only be activated or deactivated when the top is open.  I am attaching the brackes to the back of my travel trailer so the box is able to haul items used to set up the camper.
I have husky floor liners in my truck how does it work with them,"Technically yes, but the box is very light duty and could easily be broken into if left exposed in the back of a open truck bed."
is this tool for stainless steel and is the heaviest  wall thickest it will flair,Yes I bolted the feet to my bed liner and the box can't go anywhere
How quiet is this generator?,"yes, the rail locking device is inside the chest so when you close the cover and lock it there is no access."
"Why is my the vacuum pump I received with this kit and the tag that says ""pump does not contain oil"", covered with oil?","It can be locked to the truck bed.  However, you have to mount the two black strips you see in the picture to the bed using a total of 4 screws.  The nice thing is with the flip of two levers in the box, it can be removed very easily.  The levers are within the locked section of the box so it remains secure."
Will this also work on a Sport?,I have a open car trailer and I have it bolted down to it.....My wench is mounted inside of it...
is this glass or plastic,My boyfriend said they're 1/2 an inch shorter than the width of the box
Does this include the D ring?,"Their length is just less than the width of the box. Consequently, they are completely hidden underneath the box when it is secured to them. It's difficult to see unless you look very closely at the picture, but the whole bracket is laying in front of the box. And, they're not metal... they're black plastic."
For a car seat right???,"the black plastic slide is 10"". it is the anchor that the box attaches to. the box sits over them and locks in place. the box does not slide off it lifts straight up."
"Can two of these be installed in the same system or when one is turned on, will water also flow out of the other.",I didn't measure them but they don't line up to the ribbed bed of the pick up truck. one lined up on top of the rib the other lined up almost on the bottom of the rib making it impossible to mount the box. I had to shim one of the mounting brackets so it sat flush. Pain in the BUTT!
Do these come with brackets? Want to mount them on front bumper. Thanks!,They are at each edge of the box.
will this fit a 97' Chevy c1500?,"The package doesn't include the harness. You can either use the car's factory wiring or, if you want to use the included relay, run your own wiring under the hood."
is this just for 1 complete assembly,No
I have a 2003 accord coupe. Can someone tell me if these will work for a coupe as well? I really appreciate any help you can provide. Thanks!,"No, you need to use your existing wiring."
by what i read on k&N this air filter will fit a 2008 silverado 5.3L but the computer is saying it wont?,"No you have to actually buy the wire harness seperatly, didn't find out til I got it, I would recommend the bracket as well"
Will this fit my 2007 Silveerado 1500 classic body style perfectly ?,No. Buy the wiring harness from subimods. Trust me.
how many batteries will this charge,No wire is included. As I remember it did include a relay. Use size 16 or 18 wire to trigger the relay and #12 to carry the load to the horns. The horns will pull a lot of current (amps) when activated and using #12 wire should eliminate any significant voltage drop.
does this cover fit an Aventa LX tow bar?,"The wires are not provided, but they provide the relay. You'll need to purchase wires and figure out where/how to route wires."
What cars do they fit?  Do they fit a 2008 Rav4?,No it does not you have to buy the wiring.
WIll this filter fit on a 2008 BMW 335i  coupe?,unfortunately no. you will probably have to fabricate the wiring harness. it just depends on where you locate the horns.
Will this filter fit 2007 MB GL450?,Original box
can i use this to power my bedroom elecrtonics allongside with 500 watt solar panels,They are packaged in a Hella box. But these are the ones manufactures in India and not the ones from Germany.
bolts and washers included?,Manufacture box. Then in an amazon box so there doubled up
I have a bike rack that I would like to attach to the back of this. Can it be done on this item?,"The horns were in a Hella box, and were made in India.  They are loud if wired to the battery and you switch the ground.  I think we have only used them twice so I cannot say anything about how long they last.  The horns are also big, but mounting them was easy using existing holes."
Does this model fit the ZR2 Blazer? The ZR2 has a wider frame.,Hi Jess yes they came in the original Hella packaging.... I like the horns but some people don't like the sound of them. They are a higher pitch sound but can use some more lower tone. How this helps.
"How could these possibly NOT FIT any American car? Why a Chevie, but not a Cadillac? What is involved that needs to ""fit""?",Original box
is this item for Front or Rear?  ... or does the same item fit either F or R?,Typically these are mounted behind the grill.  So rain etc hits them and are fine.  Mud could quiet them as with any horn.
Is it black or red?  Mine is black but the picture shows a red one.....,"I like mine the emitters, i don't know about the conditions you stated......Go to You Tube, perhaps you can find some examples :)"
"how can you tell if you have a class one or class two  1 1/4""",yes work great even if water gets to it
fuel economy,Yes they are waterproof. I have them in front of my car where radiators are. I had them since april and when under lots of water and dirts and it functions well still. Hope it helps!
I would like to make sure that this item includes both front (right and left) floor mats and not only one mat. Thank you,"Had a couple of heavy downpour and they withstand real well. No issues at all, installed on a 2015 wrx."
What aftermarket oil filters are compatible with this unit?,They should! The material looks very convincing to stand to the elements and they sound Great too!..
would it fit a toyota camry 2010 le driver side?,It was just like a few decibels above a VW Beetle horn. A loud VW horn. Any of the sounds you mentioned would have made me happy. The stock horns on my 64 Chev. truck drowned them out.
Does it come with resister or do I have to purchase separatly,Go 2 You Tube  and hear for your self  :) A Euro sound..
How does it mount?  Does it have any kind of mounting clips on the back.  The picture doesn't show the back side.,"None of those, they have their own distinctive sound. YouTube it."
will it harm my engine?,"One of me is a loud pitch sound, and the other is a deep tone, them both together are amazing I love it!"
All other web sites state S6004P will fit my 06 duramax window pop up reads won't fit your truck????,I didn't use a relay and they are still very loud
What is the current rating for this unit?,All I did was use my existing connection from my single horn and split it to connect them into the hella horns.
Will this fit a 2013 BMW 335xi?,"I just use a regular 12 auto relay. 4 prong. Same as my HID kits etc. the one with the 30, 85, 86, 87 labeled prongs."
What are the inside dimensions?  Hope to be able to store two helmets in the box while machine is parked.,Relay comes in box. Wiring harness does not.
will this work for a 2003 chevy silverado 1500HD?,Just installed Hella Supertones - Test: https://youtu.be/sRzsSDSddM8
Does this kit include the cam seal and crank seal as well?,Mine are very loud compared to the OEM BMW horns on my R100GSPD. They get the attention of texting drivers before they run you over! They bark and bark loudly... I note they are made in India. Hat's off to them. They did a good job ...
Will this work on a 2007 F-150?,They are high pitch..very loud.  I know it is fun to push the remote and scare the crap out of people

are these heavy enough to support a tool box on frame rail of class 8 truck or to light duty for that,"Yes, this is what I did with my 2017 Nissan LEAF.  The horns have a + & - Terminal (does not matter what connector pin you use for +)  If your car only has one lead to the horn, put that to one to one connector, and make a short pigtail that you connect to your car's chassis or ground.  That is it.  Each horn is mechanically tuned to different notes, and together they will get everyone's attention when sounded."
Does the carburetor come with a mounting gasket?,"I am not sure if it will work for all vehicles, but I parallel wired both horns into one circuit on my 2007 Miata, and it worked without issue. I did not need to use the relay either."
does it come with instructions for installation? and does it require another wiring harness to be used?,"Sure ...  I didn't get in Amazon but niceeshop(TM) 12 Gauge 1M Silicone Wire - Fine Strand,12 AWG,Black And RedBE aware that I did  use this as example that Amazon have wires, didn't observe the amount  you will need or other stuff like, terminals or relay."
Has this damaged anyone's ECM like tuners can do?,not sure  i got my wires from car parts store
is this for just one side or both,"I purchased a few kits of wires and relays from Amazon to self-assemble what I needed, but I found a kit custom built for my car at an enthusiast site for my specific make/model and used that instead."
Can they be returned if I'm not completely satisfied?,"Probably too small for a navigator.  I wouldn't recommend.  More appropriate for a very small car like a cube, neon, smart car, etc."
can it be used on goat leather,"I put them on my subaru, they be a bit small on a large vehicle"

This unit is used on vehicles that have separate lights for turn and brake signals. it combines those signals  so that the single lamp turn/brake taillight will operate. My installation is on a Ford Escape. Connection was simple and it worked right off without problems.  Just pop the taillights out or fish around the back of the vehicle, connect to 4 wires with quick connectors and screw one to ground and you are in business. If you have a permanent hitch or receiver and this is intended to be a permanent install, I recommend that you smear some silicone sealer over the quick connectors, because, salt on the roads in winter can corrode the connection and cause it to fail.

I've had good luck with both manufacturers, but I generally go with the one that is lower priced or the better fit. Amazon is a great place to obtain these connectors and their customer service is great. They will always help with application or any other issues (including warranty issues) that you may have.

"Do the jacks on the trailer have to be mounted so the feet are inline with, or perpendicular, to the frame?","I emailed Meguires about a paint job on my older Ford Explorer. Seems that the body shop used a cheap clear coat over the base coat and began to haze prematurely. I suspected the clear coat was sprayed on too thin. I live in the southwest and auto paint is subject to harsh summer heat. I asked the shop to spray four clear coats but I'm sure they didn't and used some cheap stuff because paint failure happens after a couple of years but anyway, The customer care guys at Meguires suggested I use this product with a grey foam pad( I used a yellow) and my car looked like new after I finished it. The oxidized paint came right off. I also put the synthetic sealer soon afterwards and even left that on overnight to bind with the paint. You really dont need to polish your car often if you wash it by hand using a microfiber wash cloth and Meguires car wash then spray on the synthetic detailer (while car is still wet) dry off with a dry microfiber cloth. The polish is only to SLICK UP THE FINISH. Sometimes the birds get to my car and I polish that off after the hand wash but once the suface is slick and sealed, evrything will wash right off. You are right though, you go polish off some of the paint when you do this so go easy, low RPM on your rotary polisher,light pressure and remember to seal it up ! this stuff really worked well for me, I used a Dewalt rotary polisher that I purchased here on Amazon for about $150.00 a year ago. The rotary polisher is a little more difficult to use than the orbital(much lower oscillations per second) and you might want to consider that first. I have seen those at Harbour Freight Sales for about $25.00. I hope that helps !

Would these fit a 2012 Toyota Yaris?,"This is fine ""cut"" cleaner, though it's called Mirror Glaze(which is confusing-look at the red meter on left, and go lower to get finer grits), and #5 is surely an abrasive for removing scratches, heavy oxidation, etc....and should not be a repeat process over the same panels. When the panel is free of scratching(if not too deep), move to finer grit, swirl remover #4, before getting to non-abrasive ""show car glaze"", and/or wax. Hopefully not letting it get away from you, by washing and waxing often, maintaining the clearcoat...hope this helps."
is it cardboard? how likely is it to last in rainy weather?,"There's not going to be a blanket answer to this because so many environments, exposures and paint formulations exist. For me, once a year is all it takes to get the last year's oxidation off. In between I'll do a Show Car Glaze (now called machine glaze) in the spring and fall with the Fine Cut in mid-summer.I use the High-tech yellow wax as a protectant and the car is stored under a car port."
are these still available? i only ask cause it seems like the cheapest i have found on the internet!,"I read that some Honda models have water based paint jobs. It's Hondas attempt at going green. Usually the surfaces(horizontal) are over polished by dealers(or anyone really) because thats the first place we look for a shine and it's the easiest to polish. Just lay the polisher up there and turn it on. Just like a table so, paint is usually thinner there. You can purchase an instument that will measure the thickness of the paint (or ask a reliable shop to do it) check for the differance from roof, hood, trunck then check the side doors and fenders.

do these come with the lens cover also?,"This kit is for the 14mm thread size. If your engine uses that size, then yes this kit will work. The 14mm is the common larger threaded plugs.

The real issue is making sure that very little metal gets into the cylinder/on the piston; use the Drilling Foam to capture most of the metal pieces and use a vacuum cleaner with a very small rubber hose to vacuum the metal pieces off of the piston. You cannot get out all of the metal, so when you restart the engine it may ""miss"" a little as the metal burns, BUT the metal will burn inside the cylinder and the engine will quick get back to a normal idle/normal revolution.

How is this applied?  Do I need adhesive or does the backing peel off?,"Yes, the inserts are ferrous.  However, the spark plugs are also ferrous.  Essentially you are screwing a ferrous plug into a ferrous threaded lining which is all threaded into the aluminum block.  The only other real choice is to fully disassemble you head and have the spark plug hole repaired with welding.  Everything will be alloy, but the distortion of the head caused by the welding will require a minimum of the head being planed and possibly camshaft bores being out of alignment, leading  to excess wear of camshaft bearings.PS ... I have used these inserts and they are performing fine in a 2.7 litre turbocharged V6.

What are they made out of?,"I duct taped mine to a socket, then used an extension. I dont remember the size of the socket, and i also filled the grooves of the tap with bearing grease to catch all the shavings. It was my friends truck and its still running."
Is this product foil faced on both sides? even the side with adhesive? Thanks,"Hi,I used an extension and the taped the whole assembly together with duct tape. Kinda crude but it worked for me. Yes in is 3/8"""
Will this fit a '99 Arctic Cat Panther 440?,"Yes, it's meant for 3/8"""
What do you use to apply this? Do you dilute in water?,"I don't see any reason why you could not, but make sure that it drives in straight and not angled in any way."
Will this fit my 2014 Toyota Highlander? And do I need an already existing roof rack?,"Yes, a 3/8"" ratchet extension fits in the top of the reamer tap. Terry."
Can someone suggest me some battery for this product ? Thanks :),Well yes..I have done that on my hired Regina ...couldnt reach without it....By the way great product!!
Has anyone out there used this on V-Star 950?,Yes you can. There is an indentation for a 3/8 ratchet or extension in the top of the tap.
does it have clips to hold lower portion of plate,Yes you can.
Is it a fairly accurate color code as to where the current condition of the battery is?,I taped it together Ford holes are deep. Make sure piston is down and out of the way. I used grease on tap and then used a 1' piece of rubber hose on the end of air nozzle to blow out any shavings missed. Then stared engine with plug out let run for 30 seconds just to be sure. Worked well still running strong.
the update software is to this year?or what the software update?,I don't know about it working on a Dodge Caravan but it probably would.  You do not have to remove the head and you do not use a power drill. You do have to rethread the bad plug entry using the tap that comes with the kit.  Then install (screw in) the replacement threaded sleeve. Its not difficult.
sizing information,"Once you retreaded it will leave metal particle in the cylinder head, unless you have a excellent method of removing the metal particles with the head in place. You can try a magnet or a very good vacuum or both no guarantees??? -  you'll have a problem for it will damage the internal lining of the cylinder therefore making the block useless. The best practice is to remove the head.I did remove mine, hop this will help."
Will it fit and work on a 2015 VW Beetle Convertible?,"I used it to avoid buying a new head for my lawnmower after I stripped the sparkplug threads.  You do have to tap the hole to a larger size, to accommodate the Helicoil insert, which then allows the sparkplug to seat tightly.  You can do this with the head in place, but there is of course risk of metal particles getting into the cylinder, as another user has noted."
is it the front and back set or just the front want to make sure before i buy,"If you are just going to clean-up the spark plug hole threads you can use this tool providing you can get to thew hole.  However, it is less expense to buy a 144mm 1.25 tap for about $6. If you are going to install a Helicoil insert in the hole you first have to enlarge the spark plug hole to 5/8 inch diameter with a 5/8 inch drill which is not included in this kit.  Can you get a drill motor with the 5/8 inch drill aligned with the center line of the hole?  There right angle drill motors which are not as long as a standard. It is very important you drill the hole straight, i.e., on the center line of the spark plug hole and hole must be round and not oval shape to have full hreads for the insert.  You can use a cannister vacuum cleaner with a wand to suck up the drill shavings as you drill.  Some shavings will probably fall into the cylinder.  To get them out I would leave the spark plug out of the hole and turn-over the engine with the starter a few times with ignition coil wire disconnected to blow the shavings out of the cylinder via the open exhaust valve or out the spark plug hole.  The instructions in the kit tell you to use a high temperature thread sealant when installing the Heliciol insert.  This sealant is not included in the kit.  You can order this thread sealant when you order the kit.  I cost $5-$6.

is it fit 2013 lexus RX350?  I see some buyer said won't fit to the hole,"also, you might end up with steel/aluminum shavings in your cylinder head, if you TAP cut the threads shavings ave to go somewhere and most likely into your head, causing much more problems"
would this fit me i am 5 foot 9,"yes , i used a 3 or 4"" extension and it went in very smoothly..just follow the instruction and it works out great. i've put 35000 miles on the engine since i fixed it and have run it hard and it has held up to the test.."
hi would it fit a 2014 harley davidson xl883n sportster iron?,"Yes it does allow for a standard socket set to fit onto it. It's mainly designed for Spark plug threads. It first cleans out existing industry standard spark plug width 1/2"" thread, then a 5/8 "" bore is created when you turn the tap further into the head. This allows for the heli coil to thread in and then the spark plug fits into the 1/2"" heli coil. I used it on an aluminum head so I had no trouble Can't say what it would be like with iron head."
Are there holes for the seat belts to come through in the back?,"yes it does! Its two sizes. When you start it, it taps the spark plug threads then, it goes into the out size hole. When your done with tapping the hole and screwing in the new thread....the inside diameter should be the same as your spark plug."
Are these made with 100% copper or  Copper Clad Aluminum? An amazon it states 100% copper but at macautoparts its stating its copper clad aluminum.,"Yes, there is a 3/8 socket hole in the top nut section."
how many come in the package? 1 arm or 2?,kit did not have a reamer.
can i use it on a 2006 cummins diesel 5.9Ltr?,on the back in the middle right under the handle

Isn't there more color options for this product ? I thought I saw a drop menu when I added it to my cart the other. How come I don't see it now.,At the back
So is the price $36 / pair or each???,"On the back of the charger, right below the carrying handle."
What is the warranty on this part?,"It plugs in on the back, in the center. Here is a video  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaLJZZGUs0Q"
How does it stand up to rainy weather?,"Yes, i have an ES5000 and it worked with no issues."
How does the unit stand up to the elements?  I'd be using to plow in the winter and simply take off the unit in non-winter months.,"Yes, it works fine"
will this product fit my 1995 Dodge Dakota 4x4 slt modle with an 8 foot bed?,Yes
Is this will fit the Nissan Juke 2013?,Yes it will
The OEM windscreen comes in a protective case...does this one also come with the case?,Yes it will.
will this work on a 2004 toyota corolla ce?,"I have a Es5000, and it works fine"
220 volts does any one know if the inverter comes in a higher voltage of 220?thank you.,yes it did
nassan patrol,Yes
Will it work with a 6.5 hp 10 amp Shop Vac?,Yes
the lights came with two wires from each of the top two bulb holes.  what needs to be done with them?  I installed mine and they do not work,The charger works very good.
can this product be painted?,"1"" x 2"" x 3"" (smaller than the original but it works)"
Do you use this on a jack or jack stands?,Dimensions of what?
Are the bulbs included on this item?,Approximately 2 inches wide x 2 inches tall x 1 1/4 inches deep.
Will these fit a 1999 323 convertible?,The scratches are clean and black but they are still there.  The scratches puck up future dirt first so they show again sooner but for awhile they are well camouflaged.
how many come in a pack?,I just tried it on my car.  Worked pretty well.  Won't make the scratches go away.  Just makes them darker.  Makes rubber piece look newer.  But you knew that.  I think you will be pleased with the results.
"Is this ""regular"" or ""low"" profile, and what is the difference?","no, they were less noticeable but still there."
do these wheels come with tires?if not what type of tires do you reccomend?,It semi fills them in and somewhat improves the appearance but does not fully hide them
Will these fit a 2006 GTI ?,Not very well.
"Hi, can you let me know which country this tape is manufactured in? thanks",i did not use it for that purpose
"Did anybody else have a hard time drilling through the metal? I got one hole done and  need a new bit, maybe i need something stronger. Suggestions?",...DO NOT use this on paint!
Is this the 2 wire version or the 3 wire version?,this is more for your interior or tires but not for paint.
Will this winch mount on a 2014 Rincon 680. I purchased a Terra 45 and it was to big.,"I don't think it's suited to that, there are better products."
Does this come with the mounting hardware?,Other products better suited.
hello just wanted to know if it muffler silencer brings top? thank you,"no...haven't tried it, maybe if it was a black car.?"
"If this is a single lamp, does it come with wiring harness?  If not, is there any wiring with the lamp?",similar but this will make fenders black again that have sun damage. I use both..
"Would this fit my 2002 Honda Accord, length 187 inches.  The bar on top says NO, but the chart says YES.  Conflicting info.",I only used the Back to Black.  I would suspect it only differs in how long it lasts.  B to B lasts months. Does not seem to wash off..i would not use it on tkhe interior finish
How long are the wires?,I use this on my jeep wrangle to bring the fender flares and hard top to their original color. These items have sun damage and it works wonders after neglect. Much better than armor all which I also tried but I always go back to mothers!
"I have had waterproofing sprays and rubs actually cause the rubber sole to separate from the leather upper.  It acted more like a solvent, will m.o?",I've heard of people using it on their interior. It is a bit greasy for my liking. If you do use it do not use on the steering wheel it will make it slippery.
"I have a City 2013, does this fit ?","I tried, but it didn't work very well."
will this fit a 1994 wrangler YJ?,i'm not sure  i only used it on the exterior  of my jeep.sorry i can't answer it any better.
how much does each weigh?,I do not think it is designed for interior trim.
will it work with my 2000 chevy monte carlo ss,"In the interior, you will likely breathe fumes . . .  the new car smell is plastic volatile compounds evaporating at ambient temperature into your lungs."
"Do the covers fit snug on the sides on the seat/bottom, or do they just hang over?",Yes. For light interior cleaning I put a small amount of Back to Black in a bucket with some water. Wring a microfiber until damp. Wipe vinyl and plastic. Works great.
Will this work on a 2005? Be nice if it was in the description!,Yes. It has a temperature mode and includes a bead probe. It may be worthwhile to pick up the thermocouple adapter as well.
is this for two front liners?,I think mine came with temp sensing probe.  So I believe it can.
Will this fit an ET2,Probably with a temp probe. Accessory.
Some hard folding tonneaus are able to remain closed and locked while the tailgate only can swing down. Does G2 allow this?,yes it can with a special wire
Are the windows tented?,"Yes, and the meter includes a K-type bead thermometer probe.You can use a variety of other K-type probes with a K-type adapter (bought separately), also available as a separate accessory from Fluke and even some other companies."
What is the wattage requirement?,"The Fluke 87V is suppose to have better measurement functions than the Fluke 87. It also is one of the first meters designed to accurately measure adjustable speed drives. Both meters are true RMS meters, and both are very good quality meters from a great company that will last you a lifetime if taken care of."
Do you have this part for a nissan xtrail 2006? Part Núm. 3749WN or 9914WV,"Here are the manuals:87:  http://physics.ucsd.edu/neurophysics/Manuals/Fluke/87______umeng080087V (80 V series):  http://www.fluke87v.com/crm_uploads/fe_80v_users_manual_1.pdfDepending on your use, there are quite a few notable differences. For me, the 87V's ability to measure temperature is of utmost importance. But some enjoy the Hi-Res mode of the 87V even more."
Does Smarty Jr J-06 have the Power on Demand,"Differences between the Fluke 87, 87-III, and 87-V are technical and better investigated using Google, esp. regarding the GSM problem. (BTW, the 87-IV is a 187, i.e., rather a different topic)"
Would this item will fit 2005 TSX driver side door ?,"87 is the model number and the five (v) represents the version. In other words there was also an 87-2, 87-3 etc. 87-v is the current model."
have a black convertible top---do these mitts leave fuzz or fibers behind??,It will but you have to buy a separate amp clamp
I have just installed my unit Gorilla 8017. It works but it never transmit a display on my 2 way pager system. What could be wrong,"Only by using a clamp on amp meter attachment.  As supplied it only does amp readings by inserting into the circuit.  Fluke offers several clamp on ac, ac/dc, and varied current level ""probes"" as they describe them."
will the car mats fit perfectly for a ford flex 2011 SW and do the mats come in grey,Not on its own. You will need a current clamp for that.
Is this a genuine Honda factory product?  Does it come in the original Honda bag with the Honda logo on the back of the remote?,"Not with the included probes, you'd need an amp clamp to do that. Their clamp style probe has low resolution with currents under 1 amp but I've heard their thread-style amp probe is more accurate with those situations."
Do these fit a 2012 mitsubishi lancer?,"No, you would need an amprobe for that"
I'm looking for a leather sealer to use on a belt that I plan to paint. Would this do anything to compromise the integrity of the paint?,"After checking the manual I think the answer is no. There is wording in the manual:""To measure current, you must break the circuit under test, then place the Meter in series with the circuit."" There is a clamp on style attachment. Of course that would only measure large Current Flows. Other replies seem to say there MAY be a special probe for small current values."
What size tire fits this wheel?,No. And I know of no way a DMM could. Only clamp type meters do that and as far as I know their use is limited to AC.
Just bought one. do they come with 2 bulbs?,"Most likely the screen film would be gone or damaged, scuffs or marks on the rubber holster, nothing to tie the leads together, missing paperwork, etc.. Mine came in a pretty scruffy box as well (these tend to sit in warehouses for a long time). If you want you could give Fluke a call and ask if the serial number on the back has been previously registered or if it has been reconditioned."
Does the tire chuck screw off? Just wondering if I can put my own tire chuck on it. Thanks!,"On the item I received there was nothing indicating it was used. I doubt if the box was ever opened, I did not notice anything."
"Will this cover an 8"" bed sufficiently or do i need to buy additional","Yes, the leads had ties on them.  The accessories that came with it I believe had their own little bags and the box had one of those round sticker seals on it."
does this NOT come w/ a filling hose?,It seemed to be a demo model. That's what they told me. That's why I got such a good deal on it despite it being a new product.  Still worked fine so didn't really matter.
Will this fit the chuck on a porter cable dual action polisher?,The reasons that I'm asking is 1) I'm new to using digital multimeters and I'm looking for one to use as a tool for checking bad capicators on computer motherboards.
Will this fit a boy age 9,"Depends on what ""best"" means to you.  When you compare the features, accuracy, and price that meets your needs then you have your ""best"".  I selected the original Fluke 87 over 25 years ago because it offered me everything I needed for a reasonable price and I expected it to last at least 5-10 years.  Selecting the newer Fluke 87-5 when my old one died didn't take much thought.  For my varied uses, electronics, electrician work, automotive, etc. there were many DMMs that would do the job, some cheaper, less accuracy, not as durable construction, or have other features.  I stuck with what I knew worked and kept working.  If you are just checking caps, there's a lot of less expensive choices and ones that will test larger value caps.  If you think you'll be getting more into electronics then a Fluke is a wise long term investment.

what are the exact dimensions i only have a a few inches from the water pump pully,"In my opinion this is the best meter in the $300-400 range.  It has a wide feature set and good accuracy.  However for general electronics purposes this should suit you nicely.  ""Best"" is a fun word when talking DMMs and can be a bit ambiguous, there are handheld meters at twice and as much as five times this cost that have accuracy and resolution that will blow your mind.  That said the feature your most interested in when it comes to DMMs is repeatablity.  Making sure that when you take the measurement with all the same conditions, you get the same result.  That is why I love my 87-V and why its become the first meter I grab when I need a solid base line.

Installed two of these together with a 1"" x 3"" brass pipe and mounted them under my Ford F350 6.4L diesel to filter the fuel moving from my 50 gallon auxiliary tank mounted in the bed of the truck to the main factory tank.  Now I only add fuel to the aux tank so it is very clean by the time it goes through two of these filters and into my main tank.  I did all of those step downs so I would be using fuel hose.  Be careful, you do not want to use radiator or coolant hose.  I will disolve and end up in your injectors.

is the 4085 compatible with the 1104R B&W  hitch,"I have not tried at this time, my guess is that you can,  this is a pretty common filter and is in wide use. I purchased my first one from a farm supply house."
How do I fill the tank up with air? Do I need special tools? Where can I go?,Tractor Supply sells the replacement filters
I have a 2 barrel carb on my 307 and it is allowing a gas smell to fill up my garage. Will this allow smell of fuel to seep threw the throttle body?,Yes

"I own Ford Focus 2001, stick-shift SE 2.0 Liter. And I need to buy left and right front  >> Monroe 181504 Econo-Matic Complete Strut Assembly","the bag is 39 inches long, 32 inches wide, and 18 deep.  It held a weeks worth of vacation clothing and personal items for 6 people when we went to Virginia Beach in September.  Word of advise~this bag is water-resistant, NOT waterproof.  We placed all of our travel bags into trash bags before packing them in the roof top bag as a precaution, and it's a good thing we did!  We ran into a lot of rain and the bag leaked a little.  We will definitely use it again and again.  Good luck!"
is this the right fit for my 2000 Honda CR-V?,"I don't have the exact dimensions.  But I did fit 2 large suitcases, 3 big duffle bags and still had alot of room left."
Does this pack contain 2 pairs or 1 pair of lights?,I don't remember the actual size but it didn't work for my road trip the things I placed in the bag got wet

Will this work on the sliding door power lock on a Pontiac Montana?,It sits directly on the roof. It has a soft bottom so it doesn't scratch the paint. If you are going a long distance use the straps that go inside the car.
"good afternoon, serves to install it on a jeep cj5","Hi, this does not have a hard bottom but the bottom is soft so it will not scratch your vehicle.  It is like a big duffel bag you fasten on the roof."
I have a 2008 GMC Yukon Denail Awd I have the Z-55 real time dampening suspension w/air ride in the rear. Will this shocks work for my setup?,Yes it sits right on top of the car between the two side bars and it has a thick soft bottom that doesn't slide or scratch the roof
how to know the color?,"It is meant to sit on the roof, the bottom is made of a durable fabric vinyl."
Does this egr cooler have the factory style finns or the stainless steel tubes in the core ?,"It's a soft bottom, so I would say directly on the roof."
Will this fit my 2008 Jeep Liberty?,It is meant to sit directly on the roof in between the cross-bars.  It is a soft bottom.
Does Compressor have a warranty?,The inside is like a smooth plastic so very easy to wipe clean...the outside is like a canvas so I was able to wipe it down too but it really is pretty resistant to stains so I didn't have to do much.  I used it from New Jersey to Georgia and back through some rain and left it on the porch while we were there if that helps any.
Does this unit come with wiring diagram so I can put in a different vehicle that is not on your list?,Used it for a trip from VA to SC through rain.  It held up very well.  Didn't have to clean the outside but I did spray the whole thing with water repellent purchased separately.  Worked great!
what is the application for this valve body?  I need a valve body for a 1957 pontiac starchief w/jetaway xmsn,"I've never had to clean it, but I wouldn't be too rough on it. After 4 trips, the material began to rip and I had to buy a new one. That said, there's a big difference between 80mph winds and soap/water."
do u have to remove the old sealant?,I used mine to hold a double stroller on airplane. Try to keep stroller from damage. It didn't get dirty but did tear.
This question has been answered... I bought two of the 6127s. Is there a left and right?  I cannot turn the strut 180 degrees  like I thought I would be able to do.,Not sure on the RAV4.  My Honda CRV is rated @ 80 lbs I think.

Please those the brake rotors comes in pairs (left & right),Yes
Will this work for a 2004 Dodge Sprinter?  Thanks.,Yes it will fit on a small SUV.  I drive a Kia Sportage and it fit perfectly!  It really came in handy for our trip to the beach last year.  Do be warned that it is not totally water proof.  We ran into some rain on our way and some moisture got into the bag.  It was not soaking wet but there was some water that got in.  I planned for this and wrapped the things that I did not want to get wet in plastic.  Worked like a charm!

Do i get 2 handles or 1 handle?,I used it on the top of a mustang so I'm guessing 'Yes'.
does part no. 87139-YZZ08 fit 2012 toyota highlander base?   Thanks,"I think it would work to strap it through the windows. It comes with some window clamps to use with the existing ties on the bag, but I would recommend using tie-downs, rachet straps instead. I used rachet straps around the Soft pack (attached to the roof rack) and it worked great! Also we did go through some rain (not an excessive amount) and everything stayed dry. Hope this helps."
will this starter fix poulan riding mower.15hp.model 1538,"Yes, It does come with 4 strap brackets that are L shaped and turned so that they will fit on the edge of the roof and the door closes up against it.  Mine has a roof rack I use so I did not use the roof edge strap bracket."

are these for  a new style f-150? i have a 2004 new style,"I'm pretty sure it says about 35 lbs but I think you'll know what your car can handle as well as what you are storing in the bag. Towels, sheets and stuff like that you can probably go over the weight. We drove across country with about 50 lbs in there and it was completely fine"
How do you know if the unit is charging? Mine is plugged into the mains but there is no led light or anything to indicate it is charging.,I don't know the answer to that. We used it and was glad to have it. I would assume it depends on the make of your vehicle. We have a Jeep.
will this factorydash top fit a 1999 dodge ram,"I don't actually know what the weight limit is to my roof but I usually only put lighter things up there.  I would say our load is usually only max 100 pounds.  We camp with it and put sleeping bags, sleep pads, and clothing bags.

I have a 1999 gmc suburban K2500.SLT. will this bull bar fit and allow the front tow hooks to remain? where will the front license plate fit?,If its a GM type compressor then it will work. There should be a tag or mark on the unit to indicate the type. Google that number. It might help you find out. It's a basic tool. Go easy on it. Make sure everything is seated well before using.

The consumables for this machine are about 4 times that of other non pilot machines do they last longer or what,Yes
Would this work on a 1989 Nissan Frontier? The original  remote looks just like this one.,Yes
is this perfect fit for toyota tacoma 2011,This carb will work on the app as long as it has a square bore carb. This is a low rpm engine and the model #1405 would be a better choice. 600cfm manual choke
will this work on a bench seat,I think so I just recently put one on my 350 engine it is the proper one for that!
Is this part fit in toyota sianna 2013 le,"It works better on inclines.   I had regular on 1971 bronco and it work ""cough"" on inclines....got Thunder, it doesn't anymore.....keeps fuel going into carb with out an issue."
Can I use it for a Honda Civic 2013 (in the trunk)?,"The thunder series have ""avs"" adjustable vacuum secondaries. Just gives you a little bit of a better tune."
"Since this hooks directly to the battery how does it know when to turn the lights on or off?  The battery is always ""live"".","To get the technical difference, go to the Edelbrock site, and it gives a good description. Thunder series are similar to the Carter AVS type carbs, which is Air Valve Secondaries, and Performer series carbs are similar to the Carter AFB carbs, which were Aluminum Four Barrel. Differences are in the way the secondaries operate, and body design.are similar to the Carter AFB carbs"
will this fit my 2001 f150 v8 xlt?,"You would have to change the intake manifold to an aftermarket 4bbl piece, and the distributor also needs to be changed to a non computer controlled unit."
Do I have to wait to finish the current load of salt pellets before adding the ResCare to the brine?,"You would have to change the intake manifold to an aftermarket 4bbl piece, and the distributor also needs to be changed to a non computer controlled unit."
Does it come with one or two seat covers?,Yes it is. All you have to do is buy a chevy 350 carberated intake and your good to go
"Hi, I scraped my bumper on  bump and a few clips popped off from the inside of the wheel arch, will these clips fit this location?",Yes it will work fine
Do these tail lights fit the Tahoes with barn doors instead of a liftgate and does this tail light come with the black background and clear lens?,"You need to look at everything you have in the engine to determine the type of carb to use. If you have deep breathing heads a good cam, headers, exhaust, rear gears, you might want to go with something like a Holley. If this is a more streetable car that is more mild, this might work."
"Will it fit in a 2005 Toyota matrix, and what is used to cut it?",Yes
will this fit drivers side front door,Hello. Let me first say that I am not familiar with Chevy. However I have learned that the throttle linkage may be better arranged for Chevrolet as it is missing Fords AT kickdown lever. I can say that this carb is recommended for engines 350 ci and higher. I bought it for my Ford 351W. Edelbrock recommended a smaller model for a 305 size engine.
Does this come with an adhesive backing to mount it with?,"Yes, this will work. Carb is easy to tune also. Cold start is great but I also had a Holley street avenger that I felt had better performance. The Holley didn't cold start great however"
what is the diameter dimension of the funnel neck?  Just wondering if it will fit in the opening of a 1 gallon canola oil container,"The heads will work with no problem, the size of the values will make a big difference in the performance of you engine, if you are going to use this engine for much of anything other then going to the store and running the kids around you should look into some heads with 194 or 202 values.  Good luck with your project."
"Hi sellor,I am looking for left outside rear door handle for my 2007 Hyuundai Elantra.  will this fit left rear outside door?",The carb will work provided your intake manifold can accept the mounting pattern. Also need to have proper throttle/kick down linkage adapter for GM.

"I have a P255/70R 18 spare tire.  Is the 31"" the size I need?",It says on PIAA site:  PIAA 9003/H4 Xtreme White Plus bulbs.  Which does imply that H4 is a 9003
"Just want to make sure, do these fit in a 98 Toyota 4runner?",H4 should do the job
it already have a OnStar Mirror but it don't have the button on the top  so will it still fit my 2005 Equinox,These bulbs can be used anywhere that a H-4 application is used. Compared to ordinary 55 watt H-4's these are extremely bright. compared to a 100 watt application they are still brighter with a lot less wattage used and if in a plastic lensed housing it will not cook the front lens. connect without installing in existing light housings and leave on for about 15-20 minutes though because if you do not sometimes initial break in will fog your lens.
Is this a full set or just the 1st row?,"Yes you can use them for off-road but generally four on you roll use I has to comply with DOT standards and if they're too bright and cause safety issues may not be DOT approved so usually a off-roadoff-road lights will be brighter than these, I would look around a little more good luck"
"will it work for my Ford mustang 2000? if so , will i need to buy something else? Thanks for your answer",I don't see why you couldn't. The illumination is better than oem bulbs. So if you're looking for something to brighten the road better this is a solid choice. If you're looking for a whiter light don't expect hid white. It's whiter than oem just not full white.
when you install this you still need to making a hole to the roof?,I would look on Piaa ' s website for the right bulb for your car.. DO NOT Touch the bulbs with your bare hands! Wear a new pair of rubber gloves and make sure it doesn't touch anything with grease.. If you use your bare hands the bulb will last 1-3 months compared 1-3 years!
will this be the as shown in the picture with the yellow label (nto the black and white label)?,"To get a better clue check your owners manual for the type of fitting or style your car requires , or even ask the dealership and see if they can clarify this for you."
Will this fit a 94 honda civic?,Yes they are Definitely brighter than the silver stars!
"Is plate frame metal or plastic? Thanks, appreciate the help!",Yes... the PIAA 15224 H4 Style Xtreme White are brighter than the silverstars. they should help with the tinted headlights
Does this carry a new Shorai factory warranty?,I don't have black headlight housings but had silverstars on my Rav 4 before I changed to PIAA.  PIAA bulbs were brighter and put light down the road further than the silverstars.
Does not having ABS on my EJ8 effect being able to use these?,No
"What is the difference between K2323 and K2324? They both say they fit my truck, only difference I can see is the price by $2?",I'm not sure but I think it is one year
does this fit a 2001 2500HD?,Manufacturer's 1 year warranty. Mine are both still going strong and shining bright
"will this product fit my TJ with a 33"" spare tire on a rack?  Factory was too short...",I believe they have a one year warranty.
would this fit under the hood of 2006 chevy tahoe,"I don't have the package here to read, but I believe it is a one-year warranty from PIAA.  On my wife's Camry the low beams last about a year.  On my Dodge pickup they've been in place over three years and give excellent light."
"Where did everyone else use the 2 ""trunk"" lights with wiring?  I couldn't find a place.","If you need to ask that question, you probably shouldn't be paying $50 for light bulbs."
will this fit the 2014 scion tc?,I am not sure as I have not compared. I do know you will be very pleased by these for sure. They are clear/bright and have perfect hint of blue. My previous pair lasted many years (10 plus years) so consider this when thinking of cost. Hope this helps a little.
i want to know if this kit cames w/instruction  or I have to find in another place?,I would suggest trying any less expensive bulb than the PIAA. High price didn't convert to good quality. The low beam on the PIAA performs well but the high beam is terrible.
"I'm looking for LEDs inside light package for my honda 2003 van. Wanted made in japan bulbs, can you help?","No idea How they are compared, but I have Been using these PIAA for long time and they work great."
Hello I am trying to see if these will fit an 80 KZ-1300 Kawasaki and if you would have the mounts for them as well??,I have no idea. You can go to PIAA's website and get that information.
wil this alternator  fit my 1994 camaro,"Why don't you check for yourself? See where it says ""Select Your Vehicle""? Enter the year, make, and model of your vehicle to check the fit."
does this plow need a mounting plate on the 4 wheeler?,I don't know.  Amazon has a compatibility check on their site that should tell you.
Is the item durable?,I am not sure. It fit my 2006 1100 Honda Sabre.
Would this fit in a 2006 Ford Escape?,I wouldn't ..Honda says your bike is a 45 watt bulb.These are 55 .. additional heat inside the plastic headlight assembly.   Higher current draw..
Will this work on chey silverado 2005. Is this daylight white color?,"You would have to check your Owner's Manual for bulb type, and I highly recommend them. Bright white indeed! :)"
would this item fit on a 95 civic coupe,"That is a question I cannot answer. If I were to speculate, I would say that it is specific to the FJ cruiser. These are amazing bulbs though."
will these work on a honda 400ex quad?,"If the dent is only on the inside and not very big, it's possible. If the dent went through to the exterior panel which is now pushing out, it won't fix that. For what it's worth- if it's only on the inside and everything still works I wouldn't spend the money trying to fix it. Just leave it."
WOULD THIS VOLTAGE REGULATOR FIT MY 2007 FORD E250 4.6L V8?,"Maybe if it is a small dent like the size of quarter - dime.  You could better get it from the inside by removing some of the insulation if you can.  On my garage door, I could cut out a section of insulation and then splice it back in later."
Will this lens kit fit 2013 road glide with factory bullet marker lights?,Probably not since garage doors are usually not smooth so suction cups will not get good grip
this gas cap serves a cherokee sport 2010?,"The glue remover (a.k.a. rubbing alcohol) easily removes the glue from a painted surface. Try some rubbing alcohol on the fridge to make sure it doesn't affect the finish in an unwanted way. If it doesn't, you should have good luck with this item. It make take multiple attempts depending on the size and severity of the dent. Patience seems to be pretty important when using this on a car."
this key works for the truck 2013 f150 super duty?,According to the manufacturer - as long as it is not an Aluminum surface.  The product worked well on my car panel and did not harm the paint finish on it.  I would give it a try.
"What are the other dimensions of your mirror that this worked for?  Height and width.  My 2004 Passat mirror Height=3-7/8"", Width=6-5/8"", dia=7-3/8"".",Well it didn't work on our car because it was a different kind of steel. The dents came up and went right back where they were.
What PLY are these tires?,i would ask the manufacture of the dent out cross bar kit.  or general elctric . a dent is a dent.  just beware that the dent will alway be visiable unless you pull the panel and gentley  heat and put light pressure on the back side of the panel with a wooden or plastic roller to help move the crease back to the orginal position and even then it may still show. this kit is not a magic bullet for  complete dent removal.
Why is the shipping weight 20 pounds?,Yes you can ... It works good
I have a dragonfly raymarine fish finder would it work for my fish finder all day 12v 8Ah ? thanks,Yes you can
Would they fit my 2005 Gmc sierra fleet side?,"I doesn't work very well on any dents.  if the dent is bigger than the span of the cross bar, I don't think you are going to have much luck.  I made mine look just a little better, but it's not even close to what was advertised.  I would call an expert in dent removal, and not waste your money.  I think the experts apply some heat, carefully, and use several more expensive devices, from what I'm told. If you have an older car and just want a little improvement, it's ok, but if you want this to look good, BAD IDEA!  Good luck."
I have a 2014 R1200 RTW will the bags fit this bike?,"Thanks for your question J. This ""repair kit' is worthless and doesn't work well on any sized dents. Your money would be better spent with a professional paint-less dent repair shop."
"Does it come with a 3/8"" adapter?",Not totally sure. The crossbar is about 6 inches wide so the dent width should be smaller than that. If its larger I think you can find other products for those. I don't think it will work for a sharp edged crease but if the crease edges are shallow it should work.
"does this module make your head lights flash on and off , thanks","Big Dents: Not very well to impossible. Dents need to be about the size of the cups.  I saw some suction cup devices at an auto parts store that might work on big dents.Creases: In my case a round dent the size of a dime came out pretty well; a dent of the same size with crease, the crease still shows some.  Very difficult for ""no show""."
Will fit 2003 f150 Lariat,It only comes with two pulling tabs. it works on medium dents only. big dent. it will creat a high spot within the dent.
Anybody tried this in a 2014 CR-V?,This doesn't work on anything it's junk
Will this fit a 2012 1500 Chevy Silverado Z71?,Nope. Aluminum is a different creature!
is this  engine computer included the program or should be take it to dealer to make program for it,"It will be perfect for getting small dents out, that is exactly what it seems to be designed to do. Just don't expect for the dent to come out in one pull, it may take more like 20, but it does come out. Works well but slowly, certainly cheaper than having it done professionally."
is it four tires or one?,Everyone seems to have mixed results. I found it didn't work for me. Some users have had limited success with it
Will these work with a 2006 MINI?,Yes.
How do you remove the old mirror? Just grab and pull?,"It did when I ordered this product yes, both red and yellow sticks with instructions for what kind of temperature ranges they should be used with."
Any one use Adjustable Shackles with these? what kinda Lift did you get?,Yes the one I ordered a came with both yellow and red glue sticks.
IS THIS unit comparable to the MARKWORT  volcano air erupt  INFLATOR,"Yes, it includes both red & yellow glue sticks."
Will these fit a 2005 Ford F-150 as a replacement for the OEM?,"Yes it does, but you need to watch that you don't pull the dent too high. If it does you'll need to knock it down with a nylon  punch."
Do you need to put load resistors on them or are they built in?,"We use it for a dent in the front fender, and the thing fell apart. It is very poorly made."
what year model does this fit?,I had poor success with the product. A bit anemic for the task.
"Do you have extra (clear, smoke and/or tinted ) visors for this helmet (in medium)?","The demensions are spot on, when empty. They will flex a bit in the middle when full."
Just the glass is broken on mine do I have to get the whole housing kit,"I installed this tank upright for my application,but if you look at it as it it were laying flat,the dimensions are 8"" high,30 1/2"" long,16""wide.Hope that helps.So far,its been a nice tank for me,no leaks."

it is price for two light,No
What is the wattage of each LED?,Absolutely there very strong
is it brand new with box?,"I have two of these ""Bolted"" up to the bottom of a cargo trailer secured by aluminum beams. I don't keep the 30 gallon or the 15 gallon versions I have full however they've held up for over 5 thousand miles. No leaks after attaching the fittings with the appropriate glue. I would make sure the tank is firmly in place as I'd say the worst thing you could do is let it bang around. The internal baffles really stiffen it up."
"looking for center caps for 93 vw eurovan, the diameter of the hole is just under 2 "", what should I order?","James- man I'd also consider securing them down (straps or whatnot) onto runner mounts, or maybe strips of firm rubber. Just a thought!"
does this product work with both 2 and 4 door models?,They are pretty heavy duty.
Would it stick to a slightly textured dash?  The optimum position in the Element is on a slighlty cobblestone texture...I'd hate to have it fall off,I don't believe so. The ports are not big enough.
"How does this product hold up to the heat?  I live in AZ, and my previous strips had glue-- which leaked out into a little puddle at the bottom.","YES, that's what I use it for, several years now."
"Do I need longest cables (trottle, front brakes or clutch), to make them fit after raiser's installation?.","As far as I can see, if you can add the fittings needed to build it into your system there would be no problem with the tank holding black water."
"hi , how you know this remote Crimestopper RS7-G3  they works with the car and bypass. thanks",There are baffles in it so solids might get stuck over time.  I used mine for grey water  and got an unbaffled design tank for black water.
"I don't see a sizing chart, I measures a 48"" chest, what size do I buy.","No, it is blank.  It has 3/8 threaded bosses for mounting the tank. But it is abs plastic so you can use abs cement from Home Depot, Lowes etc to glue what ever abs connections you want to it.  I installed mine a few years ago.  If you look on the internet you can make adhesive puddy by mixing abs shavings and some acetone to fill in voids or to repair abs."
does this work for 2002 pathfinder?,Has 3 each 1/2 in npt ports molded plugged each end.  Just drill out the ones you need.  Great tank!   Other answer is wrong.   You can see the ports in the picture.
will it fit my 2009 ford focus SES?,As it say in the description......15 gallons.
Does my 2007 tacoma have to have had a remote entry from the factory or can I just purchase a remote entry kit and make it work?,"I'm guessing, but I'd say minimum ten if not twelve gallons"
Is this product clear light bulb as well as clear cover? I see a photo showing red light?,About 15 gal.  Nice tank very tough.   I use it as an auxiliary between wall of truck bed and slide in camper.
will this work for 2003 grand prix gt,I don't know....but the product puts on a finish that is very slick and I would guess it would do the job.
"Will these lights fit the 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee Special Edition, the Amazon parts finder says it does not fit!!??!!",It will help it not stick to the car but will not remove the sap
"I am assuming the pulley comes with this, but want to make sure?","I find that just a wet cloth takes off the ""love bugs"" we have here in Florida.  These things are acidic and can eat through your paint, but Rejex makes the cleanup as easy as wipe off with a wet cloth.  No need to wash the whole car."
"How do you install, as it will be replacement for existing 12V CFC T5 and T8 bulbs  ?","Bugs cannot be wiped off dry, some moisture needs to be involved. For light bug accumulations I sometimes use a wet cloth but for the usual heavy mess of splats it's about as fast and probably less messy to just wash the car."
Will these fit the 2013 Laredos?,I never used it on the front of my car. I only use it on my chrome wheels to prevent the buildup of brake dust. I just use some Windex multisurface to clean them.
"is this a rear bracket and how much lift will it accommodate? I've got 5""",Rejex will make getting the bug off much easier. Just use a moist towel or paper product (never ever use a dry towel as it will scratch the paint) and almost anything will come off.
Is this fit for 2008 Acura RDX?,This stuff is awesome...just wipe off with soft towel
How far can this light go? what is the exact length of the lens(w/o the housing) because I am planning to put it behind a hole in my bumper.,"I still seem to need to wash to get bugs off.   Also to get brake dust off the wheels too.    With my chrome wheels, compressed air does not remove it.    Granted bugs and dust do come off very easily.   And I do like this product to keep my chrome/steel wheels from rusting.."
Does this come with its own hardware? My YJ has never had any type of soft top hardware since I've had it. What else would I need?,Yes you can.http://www.rejex.com/rejex.html
Will this bumper work if you have a receiver hitch already installed?,There is nothing better. Nothing sticks to it.
I have  2014 3500 dual wll these fit,"Yes, I have used it many times on a fiberglass body corvette.  Just remember first to wash with dawn dish detergent, cuts through grease and old wax so rejex can bond to fiberglass.  Easy to use, leaves no white residue, great product for fiberglass, aluminum or metal."
Is this grill 2 pieces or 1 piece?,"yes , it works very well on fiberglass."
do i need to add a resister if placed on a 2002 vw eurovan,"I always wipe as soon as there is a haze.  ""Curing"" is most likely unnecessary and one good coat last for months with water still beading."
I am considering buying this for the rear rack of my bicycle. Would it fit and securely hold a messenger bag (about the size of a briefcase)?,Should work just fine. I do my 5th wheel twice a year with Rejex and it looks like new. And we are fulltime rv'ers so it sits outside 24/7. Sometimes it's just not possible to keep it out of direct sunlight for the cure time. PS: My 5th wheel is 40 feet and takes about two 16 oz bottles.
is it supposed to be as thick and heavy as the floor mat material? mine seems super thin and flimsy compared to the floor mats.,"Yes, it'll work"
has anyone tested to see that the watt ratings are as advertised?,"I have no idea. But, this is the best product I have ever used. I'd call the manufacturer."
I have a Hyundai Sonata 2006 will it work ?,"Hey, I have used this stuff for years. Being that I only wax my truck 2X a year, a bottle will last me several years. I have never seen any signs of degradation as it got older, and I know some of my bottles have been over two years old. Hope this helps."
Will these fit a 2012 Chevrolet Equinox?,"I do not sell the product, I am a customer who purchased the product some time ago."
"If someone steals a RFID card from me, will reprogramming all of the remaining RFID cards with the lock disable the missing RFID card?","This won't repair chips.  It is a sealer/polish.  In my opinion it works very, very well at that task."
The price $859.98 for both does that mean two front and two rear?,"This stuff works great on glass.  Even removes light water spots and keeps future water spots from happening.  Does not smear, just be sure to use a CLEAN cotton towel to polish."
does this fit honda fit 2012 sport with fog lights?,I would not recommend this on glass.  It may smudge and not be able to remove.
There are two different pumps on Amazon.  One with no number and the other 6176A.  What is the different other than $30?,I think I would be comfortable using them to support a car in storage to save from a tire going flat but would prefer a more heavy duty set of jack stands if I were crawling under it to work on it.
will this rack fit a vt honda shadow 600 vlx w/o modifacation /,"Yes each are rated at 6000, I used them to support my mobile home"
Is this tire tubeless?,"Beats me, I don't know why you wouldn't unless you didn't have the $30 to begin with. I sure am happy with mine and I bought s second set for my step-son (scratch that) My new best friend."
Will it fit a Jeep Liberty,"Honestly, I would think that a car jack stand is made to hold the full weight of a car for when the wheels are off of it, or something similar.  These are made to just support the weight of the camper to keep it from rocking when you reach your site.  I would contact the manufacturer before I used these as a car jack.  Works perfect for stabilizing a camper! :)"
Will I need to buy a rocker w,"I would not use these for anything that is suspended, like a heavy car.  These are a lighter jack and work great for additional support to balance or keep a trailer from rocking.  I used them on a trailer with single axle to keep the trailer from tipping back with too much weight in the wrong places since I was working on the surface of the trailer and walking around.  They would work also on RV trailers to stabilize the movement of the trailer when parked....."
What is the typical date of manufacture on these units?,These stands are for leveling an RV.For vehicles you want to use vehicle specific jack stands for safety reasons.
Will it guard against rear window breakages. My car was broken into thru the rear passenger window. Thief took my GPS and MP3 player. Smash and grab.,"It does say ""jack stand"" on the box but I would use it only for stabilizing an RV which means it keeps the RV from rocking when walking inside the RV. The metal used to construct them appears to be a casting. The top of the stand is small in size and it could easily slip loose."
I have a 32501 that i used on my 2007 chev 2500 duramax. i have since upgraded to a 2015 2500 duramax. can i use my existing 32501 on my 2015?,These jacks are to light to be used or cars. These stands are just for support on trailers and camper trails.
Will this part fit a Mercedes 2005 c230 kompressor 4 door?,"No, no, no.....these are light weight aluminum and won't work for that."
Does anyone know what batteries this remote takes?,"These jacks are primarily for stabilizing trailers.  They do not "" jack up"" (or down),  but rather,  their movement is accomplished by turning the screw. I hope I've given you a proper description from which to determine their suitability for your  specific need."
how breathable?,"it IS a jack stand.  Doesn't matter whether you use it for a car or camper as long as you're within its limitations of weight.  It holds a car when it's already lifted on a jack and prevents car from dropping if jack fails.  Car typically is heavier than a camper, but 6 ton seems adequate to hold one corner of a small car. And again, you use it as an additional safety measure with a car jack, not as a lifting tool on its own."
can I use it for rear side?,These are stabilizer jacks. They fit perfectly on the Camco stabilizer pads. Leveling blocks are different. They are usually put under the tires. Once level the stabilizer jacks are placed under the frame in each corner of your trailer or rv with jack pads under the stands to prevent sinking or movement as you walk around or are loading while unhurried from towing vehicle.
we need the bolt as well as this part. Do you have the bolt for this part?,I have only used these on the ground or on pavement with nothing else under them.
I have 2006 325I.It has Xenon headlights. One is broken so this pair would fit my car? There won't be any error after I replace this light?,17 inches but we just go 15 to err on the side of safety.
would this fit 2012 subaru forester,it exstends 17in tall
my 2007 Street  Glide already has a sissy bar docking system can these two docking systems be mounted at the same time?,"17"". However I use with the Camco 44595 stabilizer jack pads  (4 pk.) for additional height. Each pad gives an additional inch. Jack stands fit into the pads so there is no slipping!  Anymore height one should try using a scrap piece of 2x12 lumber."
is it fit for 2013 highlander?,Leveling
can you attach a basket to these?,its more 4 stabilizing but works great
Fit 1996 Honda Accord?,7.7 lbs total weight for 4.
"Well, I see this fits in a 4 inch diameter piple.  What is the LENGTH of the entire unit?",All four come in the box.
"The instructions say ""Torque the bolts to 10 NÂ·m (7.3 lbfÂ·ft). Can someone suggest a torque wrench that will do this?""",all 4 (they are very light)
Can the existing vent cover open 100% without binding up against the new ub1500 cover. Are the UB1500 covers hinged on one side?,All 4

will these fit a 2013 Hyundai Elantra GS   COUPE??,for all four.
Do these lights come with LED capacitors?  Some of the reviews mention this as part of install. Thanks for your response.,All 4.  and with the stems removed they nest into a very compact size (As they are packed).
Does it stretch o a larger size?  Is the cord like a bungee material.,We are having absolutely no problems with them on our tip-outs on a park model.  We also purchased the pads that these are made for so they would be evenly held.  They would work fine on a class A.
Could this be used to replace a standard knob door handle?,I don't think that would be a good idea - not heavy duty enough.
Does this fit a 2015 Prius 2?,I bought this for my new Ford Escape SUV. I should have paid more attention to the dimensions because it isn't large enough to reach across the cargo area. It looked substantial and like it would have been great if it had only fit.
What is the expiry date?,I use it in an Explorer Sport Trac 2nd generation. It makes it across and works fine. I use it mostly for grocery shopping bags.
This did come with bolts and brackets. Was it suppose to?,Can't you just add 'extensions' by using short bungee cords?
It will fit the BMW GS 1200 2008,It will probably be too big.  You have to screw brackets into the side of the interior of the car.
will this battery work in a golf cart?,Yes
Will it work  in Honda CR-V LX 2014 and some additional parts for complete installation ?,Yes
Does this particular Philips H4 Xtreme Vision headlight bulb have both HIGH and LOW beams??,It's  fits a 2003 Chevy avalanche it should fit your Ford  explorer
Do I need an adaptor? My truck has the four little rectangle lights.,Yes. Just be mindful that if your trunk doesn't have hooks you might have to drill screws into your panels.
Will this fit a 1973FX,"If you have hooks for the netting to attach to, in the rear compartment, it will work. 4 hooks would be better than 2 hooks."
"Is this the Hitch that has a 10"" drop not a 7"" drop, also with 3 adjustable balls?",You should have no problems at all. It fits in an 03 Explorer size should be the same.
will this fit on front and back of my dodge charger,It has loops at the top on the right and left sides. It also attachments for the loops to fit over. It works very well. It is in our Envoy.
I have a 2009 VX Cruiser - will this fit it?,They're like 4 knob type hooks. You can place them however you want.

"Are they 1/2 X 20 thread, And what socket size?",If the need is a standard width I'm sure it will.  You will have to drill pilot holes in each side of the bed to put the knobs on so you can hook the net over them.
"does it fit a 2014 kia soul, and does the key come out on the side?",The net is a universal size so I don't think you buy one specific to a model car. Mine is fitted to a 77 Pontiac Grand Prix and it contains items and stops them being flung around around rather than looking looking like the example in the picture.
"can this be used as go kart motor? if so, do u sell the battery for the motor?","This one will be a good fit for your car...as long as u have 2 ""buttons"" on each side of the car for the corners...hope this helps!"
will this fit a 2002 tundra.,I have 2007 Impreza Outback Sport. It's smaller than 2011 Outback. But I'm pretty sure it will fit your Subaru.
What comes in the box?,I have across a Chevy Avalanche so I'm pretty sure it will fit an Outback
The tire I am replacing is a 75R.  What does the D represent?,Yes it will fit in 2015 CRV.
does this have purple trim,"Measure the inside of your Honda CRV.  The box states 44"".  Stretching it, it prob is.  I come up with 42""...I should have measured my truck before I ordered."
Does anyone have the winch on this bumper?? I'm wondering how you access the free spool lever when the unit is hidden behind the bumper?,This is built for a standard size truck bed.  You have to drill four holes in the upper portion of the bed to insert and secure the net.  I have a standard Chevy pickup and the fit is really snug.  I would measure the distance on both a standard size and if they are the same or yours is less than two inches smaller it should work fine.
"I am looking for and need same item front and rear rack extensions to fit 2003-04, Polaris, 500, Sportsman to bolt onto the factory vinyl racks.  Any?","It's somewhat large but works ""ok"" in my New Ford Taurus. I had a net in my last Taurus purchased from the dealer that fit perfectly but was much more expensive."

Can you use 134a freon?,did not fit my 2005 Aviator....had to use hooks and they did not help much. Sorry
will this work on stained wood?,"Best option is to use a tape measure and see if the dimensions in the ad will work out.  The kit includes 4 mounting 'lugs' which must be screwed into the paneling/upholstery (may not be ideal depending on how original-condition you want to keep your car).  However, I found the storage unit fit quite handily in the bed of my full size pickup."
Are these 20 hr batteries? If not what are they?,Yes as long as you put it towards the front back or sides. I put mine in the back of my Tahoe and it holds items in place. I really did not want to put holes into the vehicle so I put this basket in with some tape hooks.
"Where is this jack made, i.e. its country of origin?","8 1/2"""
"This came up in the search results for my 1998 VW Beetle (base coup, 2.0L); will it actually fit in my car?","I can't say for sure because the shaft was too short for my Traverse and I no longer have the hitch.  But maybe knowing it is a shorter shaft will help you.  Also, the further away from your vehicle you can get your trailer, the more clearance you will have, for the most part.  I have one now that works but I wish I had gotten a longer one, fyi."
"Hello, Which  is the real Shipping Weight? if I buy two pairs",Please refer to the Curt website for specific information about all hitches. That's always the best way to research such issues. I'm just a user without details.

Can I just buy the front mats? 328i 2008 blk,With a bushing you can.
"Is this a 2'' hitch opening or 1.25""","Yes, when used upside down it raises ball 2""."
"What's it like driving with it folded up, looks like it would cause alot of issues due to the added surface area.","yes, but the weight  carrying capability is diminished. The loads are printed on the hitch so you may decide if this is the correct hitch for your load"
Do you know how  many miliamps it draws? (using 12v) Any idea how many lumens?,yes
Will this intake fit a 260 cu.in.,"It's 3.5"", but so are my other two drop hitches."

"Will this system fit the 07 Civic Si,  4DR Sedan?",The shaft is 6 inches long.
will the grill fit a 2000 honda civic ex coupe?,Pin hole is 5/8 inch in diameter.
Do these mats have spikes on the bottom to help keep them in place,the pin hole is five-eights . And the ball mount size one-eight of an inch. Hope that helps

Use an ohm meter to tell you if it's OK."

How much fluid does the funnel hold comfortably  - in liters or ounces? Does the funnel have marking on the inside?,"This works very well for interior plastic and vinyl and smells very nice.

She is 120v or 220v? I want the 220v. thank you!,I think it is not necessory. I don't see much different between meguire quick interior and others.
does it come with any mounting hardware or do i need to order it as well?,You don't need it.  But one tip.  Quik Interior Detailer has light cleaning abilities.  So what is commonly done is using quik interrio detailer for it's cleaning ability.  Especially on lightly soiled interiors.  Follow that up with Natural shine or any of the protectants.  The protectants last longer with a clean and prepped surface.  It's a good 1-2 combo.
Will this fit 2003 M3 convertible? Thanks in advance,"It kinda restores the rubber of the tires to what they looked like when new. It definitely is not a wet or high gloss look that lots of people like, but then wears off quickly."
Anyone ever use this on a subaru forester 2014?,I never tried it on the exterior of the vehicle. I only use product on my dashboard.
Do you have to remove the skid plate?,Works well on tire wall if you don't like shine. Give the tires some depth to their color. I would use a dedicated leather protectant.
DOES THE LIGHT CHANGE ANGLES WITH THE MOUNT,I dont think it will provide a durable finish since it is not meant to be used on tires and absolutely not onleather. Only vinyl products. For tires you want to use their spray on gel which will last way longer on the tires.
does this come with all the nessicary hardware to install and install stock wheel back? I have a 2011 f 150 stock 17'' rim would like to push the tire,"This product is OK to use on tires but may not last as long as products designed specifically for tires.  The label says to use this product on vinyl, rubber, or plastic & it works great on those. I would not use it on leather."
will it fit subaru forrester,I wouldn't use this on tire walls. The best thing I've found for tires by far is a tire gel. I've used this on leather trim on my car and it works nicely. It will make it a bit slippery though. You may want to look and see if Meguiar's has a leather-specific treatment for cleaning your seats.

Are these tires bias ply tires or are they radial tires?,"It is just a wiper blade, not vehicle specific. You need verify what kind of mount your vehicle has"

Is this product really black or it is like the Rugged Ridge that saids blanck and it comes on gray,"You need to check the adapter on your windshield blade actuator, this particular blade comes with three different types of adapters, it does fit almost all types of windshield blade actuators.  You can find out very easily if you look at what is on your car now and the pictures provided by amazon.  Also amazon has a fit check feature, I used it for all the parts I have purchased on my 08 mini clubman, everyone said they fit and when I received them it was a true statement.  Good luck."
Will this fit the 2006 Volkswagen Touraeg?,"It will fit nicely, as there is no floor in the tent the toolbox can remain in the bed of the truck. Ours fit in a 1998 Dodge Ram with a toolbox. On a recent camping trip with our 5 year old grandson, we put a dense foam liner on top of the toolbox and he slept in a sleeping bag on top of that, while we slept on an air mattress in sleeping bags on the floor of the bed. worked great! Room only for sleeping and stashing a few items on the side inside the tent."
Do you know if it would fit a 2004 Honda VTX 1300?,Fits our 2002. Would imagine it fits 2008. It does not fit with the tool box in it. We love it!
Does this item fit a 2012 Malibu LT,My husband says it depends on the bed size. The company has a website with specific truck models and the item numbers that work with them.
will this remote work with 2008 trailblazer LT ?,"For this tent, (which I love BTW) I would just measure the length and width of the truck bed from the outside. For a Ford Ranger you definitely want the smaller one I would think."
Hi  will this fit in a 2008 beetle thanks.,"Agree with Rachel...this tent fits a full sized GMC pickup bed, so would be too long and too wide for a Ford Ranger or other smaller size truck.  Great product though!"
does this have a warranty like hydro flask?,I dont know the answer to that question but I will tell you the other comments I have read (regarding sweating and condensation) have not been our experience (and we have used it in humidity and rain.  Coukldnt have been happier with this purchase.
Is the center cap 90mm? I need the VW part to measure 90mm.,Contact Rightline - they have versions and sizes available for different makes and models. Its a good tent.
"If my tacoma is already level should i use 3"" blocks instead of 2"" in the rear to maintain the level position? its 1/8"" lower on front now",we used it on a different vehicle and the airbed worked fine.  but do not know about the tacoma. ;( sorry
will this work with my 05 corolla,Yes. Depending on the size of your airbed. I bought an airbed that fits around my wheel wells.  Which fits great!
Will this fit a 2011 Challenger SRT8 6.4?,I have a 2002 GMC L/B and I suspect it's similar in size. It sits on top of the truck bed gunnels (sides) and leaves almost 100% clearance for a mattress that size. Off hand I would think you'll be fine with the fit and I can certainly recommend the tent as a good quality piece. Good luck.
Will these covers fit the 2014/2015 Camaro line as well?,You get the 1 that is for your type of truck. Mine is 4 a 2001 dodge short bed 4 wheel drive and works great.
How big is this?,"No, it attaches to it and also you'll loose about a foot of room with it."
who will cut thekey,You have to look at the length of the bed. This tent is designed to and fitted with the tailgate in mind. Without a tailgate it would be loose and not water tight and might not anchor itself properly.
will this fit my 2013 jaco jayflight swift 19' camper?,really needs the Tailgate because of the way it is designed :(
can they be cut?,I have a 2001 GMC and the tailgate seems to me to be an integral part to the set up. The back section loops around and over the gate to secure the rear 1/4th of the tent.
Other website says it will fit 2013 xterra x as well. Is this correct?,"I would never try it. It might withstand high winds blowing at it, but not the effects of a really turbulent wind like when you're driving. It takes 10 minutes to setup then 10 to tear down and pack away. It's worth spending that time instead of trying to drive off with it."
will this switch work in a 2000 club car ds?,It's a very cool tent but I don't think it will withstand that much wind. At least I have not attempted to drive with it still on.
how long is the 4 inch tip,"I Cannot guarantee - but I would guess yes. I bought the Avalanche style to fit my Ridgeline, the sides go over the outside and the inside of the bed rail with adjustable straps and the front (cab side) is completely open and goes over the top (about 30%) of the cab."
Will this fit a 2014 BRZ?,I don't think so.  The front is designed with drawstrings that cinch into the ridge between the cab and the rail system.  If you don't have something the same length and solid to make that connection it might leak.
Subaru Dealer sold me this filter for a 2011 Outback.  Much smaller than the ones I purchased last time.  Did things change?,"There aren't really any gaps for mosquitoes to get through, its just like a regular tent, only in your truck bed."
Does this fit a Ford E350 15-passenger van model?,no problems with that but I mounted a good size fan inside which creates positive pressure inside so this may stop them from getting in as well
Can these be used with hot water if I wanted to use them as inline H/C filters for my washer?,None on mine. We usually have a couple citronella candles around the camp ground too and that helps to keep them away.
will this fit the 2014?,"It hugs the truck tightly, even the tailgate. So as long as it's closed, there shouldn't be any problems. It clips along the outside and inside around the entire bed and the tension provided from the straps leave no gaps."
Whats the warranty on these?,"This is a grounding switch.  When closed it closes the circuit (which is grounded) and open, it opens the circuit.There is no grommet on any of the ones we have.   Are you including the black plastic push pin or just the barrel itself?  With the black push pin it measures 2 1/8 in. and barrel only from the nut down is 1 1/4 in."
would it fit a honda civic LX 2008?,"Yes, you should be able to close the tailgate but, you still have to isolate the lights from the ground of the truck.  When you  open the tailgate the switch will close, which in turn activates the ground on the lights.  The positive will go through the switch."
Will this fit 2008 BMW 328Xi?,"Yes. Assuming your electrical system is negative grounded, you're just gonna use this to open and close the ground side of the circuit. Much like most switches when you open the car door and the dome light comes on"
Is the lens plastic or tempered glass?,Yes.  Just connect the ground wire to the pin switch and you're good to go
is a two or only one,The switch can be used for that using the ground wire. That is what I used to activate my under hood led light.
The sensor is photoresistance (not a photovoltaic)...  needs an external 12V power supply.  Will it tolerate a range of 9V to 24V from pv?,Yes you can. We used ours in a tool box in our pickup truck. When the lid is lifted it turns on our LED lights.
Does your OEM replacement version use the same mounting brakets and mounting hole locations as the original Honda running boards,Yes you can! The pin switch will give you a ground when your hood is open !
Do you need to clean it out after using it?,The plunger is spring loaded and when it's released the contacts close.
Will it work on rav4 2007,"It just a ground interrupt like for a door switch in a car, thats what i used them for."
How much would PG&E charge for electricity used?,The chassis of the switch connects to a sheet metal ground. There is a spade lug on the center pin that you connect the ground lead to whatever device is being connected. The circuit is completed when the switch is relaxed (fully up) and breaks when closes.
"How does this cargo net attach in a CX-5 which has 4 attachment points on the floor: 2 forward on passenger & driver sides, and 2 rear on passenger &",No Diagram. Just hook to Positive (+) side of alarm circuit and when door is open it grounds out (-) and trips the alarm.
Do these come with detailed instructions I am a novice at replacing led so far I have just done bulbs,"It's just a NC (normally-closed) switch designed to be held-open when installed to prevent a complete circuit until it is released.  It is intended to be used as an open ground but could be wired/installed to act as a ""positive"" contact.  These are about the simplest limit switches in existence.  If you can't easily grab the concept of how they work, maybe you should hire someone to do the wiring for you."
Will this key work on a 2011 Ford Fusion?,"circuit is open (no power) when spring loaded pin is pressed down... when pin is ""up"" the circuit is closed and there is power to whatever is wired to this switch...  power lead is red clip at the bottom...  the pin switch must be grounded by the attachment nut near the top- or a separate ground wire must be used... I hope that helps some."
Will this work on the 2015 and does it stay attached if you install it yourself?,"Connect to a negative trigger wire, preferably with a diode"

will this fit a 2010 honda fit?,It's for 5.  I ordered four of them and got 20!
"Good afternoon, that voltage is the Recovery Machine?",Not my add. But I did buy them and did receive 5 pinswitches.
Does it discolor or fade after use? will it slip while driving?,"Exact current I would have no way to measure and nothing was on the box. The black plastic, spring loaded, shaft you see in the picture actually goes all the way through the metal housing and when pushed in, the Spade connection will get pushed away from the housing thereby breaking the electrical connection, so switch is closed with pin extended and open when pushed in."
Are the emblems already mounted or decals that you have to apply to the cap?,Quite a few amps I would suppose... when extended (door open) the circuit is closed to ground.
Does this bumper fit 2005-2012 or 2005-2013? It list both.,"Switch is NC to ground.  Do not know exact current capability, but surface contact  area on switch is pretty small so my guess is 2 to 3 amps max."
how cold does it get in propane mood,"fully extended it is grounded like looking at picture now, when depressed it is open.and I would just run a relay with it not much power needed for that. Hope this helps"
what means a Spot beam(10 degree),If you're worried about it just use a relay to handle load.

I have a 2015 Hyundai Tucson; will these fit?,What you see is what you get.
Is this as good as a gel battery?,About 6ft enough for you to sit in the drivers seat.
"Can this be cut (I  only want it on the back, not the seat), or will all the beads fall off? I.e., is each bead indeoendently attached? Thanks","I just went and measured.   From where the cord starts at the bottom of the pistol grip to the end of the clips is 68""."
Will these work to replace with T5 wedge bulbs?,I bought because of the lies told in your advertisement.  I have a 1970 VW beetle and I could not get it to work.
"Can I use these to, effectively, hold water? In the long term.","Yes, I`ve used it on an old 6 volts VW beetle and worked perfectly."
"Title says backup light, description says red stop/turn/tail light. What is it?",Could say it burnt up the 2nd time I used it.
would this fit a 2006 ford escape,I didn't use it on 6 volts but I don't see why it wouldn't.
Are the actual lashes pink or just the strip of tape?,"Jim, as I don't have 6V units and actually never considered it so I checked the manual and on Page 5 under ""Operating Specifications"" it says 1.) Power Requirements: 10 to 16 volts DC as well as on the box cover with the addition +/- 1% accuracy. (I hope that's what you meant) Under that same catagory...Operating Temp 32F to 122F (0-50C); Tach range: 240-9990rpm (box says 249-9990); Timing Advance Range 0 to +90 degrees.  Check out the manual yourself is you like at http://www.equus.com/Content/Support/Manual/5568e.pdf  Steve"
I have a 2003 civic lx.. Will it fit?,There is no reason I can think of why it would not work on a 6 volt system.
Is the basket removable from the hitch bar that goes into the hitch?.  basket looks like it bolt on to this bar.,It doesn't really matter what voltage your vehicle uses. All this does is bridge the starter trigger wire to a constant positive. Once you hook it up right it will work.
What are the  measurements of this battery?,"I haven't tested it, but I don't see why not. It's just a remote on/off switch. As far as I know, a switch that does 12v will also do 6v. Quote from the Internet: ""The switch doesn't care (generally) what the voltage is (within reason)."" - Danny in CO"
are these bulbs dimable?,of course  -- it only completes a path of the current from point a to pt. b  6/volt or 110
is it compatible with a 1992 ford crown victoria,"Technically yes, as long as its hooked to a soleniod that requires low amperage to actuate.   It may also be worth considering the CP7854 Heavy duty Remote Starter Switch"
i have the limited edition 2014 will this fit ? thanksfor your answer,ive only used in on 12 volt systems on semis. I do not like the quality of the item. It actually stopped working after my 3rd use. I would recommend a more reliable unit.
Does this kit include a gauge as well?,"I would think that it would work fine on a 24 volt system.  This is just a switch.  The amperage might even be higher on a 12 volt system.  I have not used this switch since I purchased it, but I would not hesitate to use it on any automotive type voltage.  Hope this helps."
Would this work on a 95 softail custome with some wire modifications,6 Feet.
Does this unit have a built in timer to control when the charge starts to benefit from lowest overnight rates?,The leads are at least 5 ft long and have alligator clips on the ends. You can extend as long as you need them.
is this a direct fit for a 06 chrysler town n country 3.8L eng.,"Not having actually measured leads,I can only state that I'm restoring a 66 C-10 with a 327 Eng.The leads are connected to starter on Right side  of Eng. and I stand at the radiator with plenty of length to move around as I adjust the Timing.Hope this answers your question.The Actron CP7853 works just fine.."
How do i get the installation instructions in English?  Can someone post it here?,On my 1968 Chevy II Nova I can attach the clips to the starter and stand to the front of the car and see my timing marks. I had other brands before and they are basically all the same length.From the base of the switch to the end of the clips the cable is 68 inches long.Aloha from Hawaii.
"Specs say 250 lumens.  Is that at 12 volts or 24?  If that is 24 volts, what is the lumen output at 12 volts?",The cable is 6 Feet long
Is there a way to lock this down?  worried if we left campsite for day or at night someone could walk away with it!,YES  Hook one side to ground and one to + positive on starter selinoid of starter
Anyone mount these on a boat for night time lights?,Hook one end on to positive cable on starter and other end on small wire from ignition going to starter push button and it should start
"The width is 7"", What is the hieght dimension?",Connect one clip to the positive(+) battery post and the other the smallest of three connectors on the starter solinoid. If the solinoid is o.k. the engine will crank.The solinoid on my vehicle is part of the starter. The solinoid was bad but I had to replace the whole starter. Cranks like a new car now. Hope this helps you.
will these fit a HD 2013 ultra classic ?,Connect one of the wires from the remote starter to the positive battery terminal and the other to the smaller of the 2 wires that connect to your starter.
how fast tire inflation?,"One lead goes to either the positive battery post OR the large cable stud on the starter. Second lead goes to the small wire stud on the starter, often it's just a spade connector on the starters solenoid. This switch basically acts to bypass the whole starter/key hot wire setup but make sure to leave your large cable hooked to the starter so it can still get good battery current and not damage this switch."
how/where can I purchase the prescription insert for these sunglasses?,Honestly depends. Slight mod of the bumper might be needed. But I didnt have to pull it
will this fit drivers side front door 2008 328 ix  vin # WBAVT735X8FZ37232,Depends on your car. Toyota Corolla yes.
"how much weight can these hold? looking for something to hold my school bag (books, laptop, water bottle)","Nope. It bolts right onto the frame behind the bumper. You may need to drill 1"" holes to get the bolts into the frame so make sure you have a drill big enough to hold a bit that large. I had to drill for my installation but there was a different set of bolts if the holes weren't necessary."
Does it also fit 2014 Summit? I saw another similar item fit all other trims but Summit.,"No, you don't need to remove the bumper.  If you select the right model, the hitch receiver should fit right below the bumper after installation."
do these light up when you press th brake or just when you have your lights on?,NoBut you Will have to re tap some metric treads to get all the bolts started though
"Does this cushion leave any marks or residue on the seat over time?  I have bright beige colored, leather seats",No but drilling the holes is a bugger
I have a light 5 inch scratch on a structured leather purse. Will this product alone help?,"Hi Brad, no the bumper does not need to be removed.  It bolts to the frame and hangs just below the bumper.  It was a 15 minute installation."
Does spare tire comes with new car,"No...  It was very easy to install...  The bumper and receiver assy ( shown) are notConnected in any way... Nor is the bumper in the way..  LASTLY, no drilling was required on my 1993 Prizm"
Are these sold each or pair?,You dont remove the bumper and in most cases the holes are drilled with the nuts welded in place for just such an install.
What is the total overall length (rod & gas cylinder) of these lift supports?  My previous order from Amazon were too short and had to return.,My 1997 corolla was a perfect fit.  Not modifications needed. Just bolted in place about a 15 minute install.  I did need to chase my corroded threads with a tap.  No interference with the bumper at all.
"I just want to replace the standard leather bags on my 2001 Yamaha Roadstar 1600, will the hardware already on the bike for the leather bags work for",Correct. On Curt's web site Toy/Corolla & Chev/Prism wete listed under that part number
Do you carry replacement wheel studs for these spacers since I have stripped one,It fit my 1996 Prizm and nuts were already welded in place. The frames couldn't have changed that much over that spn of time and would say it will fit.
Will these bulbs work in outdoor fixtures where the bulb is not fully protected from the weather?   Like deck rail lights without a lens on the bottom,I am not sure of a prizm but I would assume so.  It was a perfect fit on my 1997 Corolla.
2008 128i cpe,They came pre gapped. However I did check just to verify and be on the safe side. I didn't need to make any adjustments.
Is this waterproof ? Do I need to re-apply a coat if the stuff gets dipped in water ? (I want to use it to protect kites used for kitesurfing) Thanks,No they say not to and I did not gap them  pre gapped for the car You buy them for
what is the number is it F0512B2506?  says CertainTeed 3.5Amps P/N 35199,Nope
discount,No they do not need to be gapped. The spark plugs come with a tube cover protecting the threads and electrode incase the box is dropped.
"Can anyone else confirm that this one is made in Japan.  Some reviewers noted that it is, but I'm hoping to make sure before I ""pull the trigger.""",One per box. You have to order two to get two plugs.
Have an 85 z28 camaro. Will it work since there is no EGR on this carb?,The price is for one spark plug.  You must increase the quantity if you want more than one plug.
What is the center to center mounting holes for this Safari Bar?,"The reason might be  these are Honda  spec  spark  plugs .  Engineered to oem  spec, every car company spends millions on  engine development  and choose the parts that best suite  it engine ."
hi can anyone tell me if this a mazda b2500?,You should use the spark plugs that are specified for your vehicle. The correct spark plug can be found in your owners manual.
does tg 6606 fit 08 infiniti ex 35 6 cyl engine,"If the single word ""gap"" is a question about the gap of these plugs as supplied, I don't know and I would not focus on it.  I re-gap any and all spark plugs I install.  Gapping plugs is an easy process using very simple measuring and setting tools available at any auto parts store.  When you are spending $10 or more per plug and saving $30 per plug compared to dealer costs, buying the tools and the time required to reset the plug gap is easily justified.  Even if I knew the plug gap was supposed to be correct for my application I would at least check it before installation."
will this work on 87 sea ray merc,"Having previously read that the manufacture specs were right, I did not check the gap.  That was 30K miles ago in my 2003 Civic."
Will walking on it in high heals/pumps put a hole in it? We won't have much room to walk around it when we get out of the car.,"chesk your car manual. , but they are factory pre gap already ."
I have a Jeep Wrangler X with a P225/75/R15 spare tire.  What size would give the best fit without any sagging?  Small?  Medium?,"These are pre-gapped to .044.  I bought a set 95k miles ago, and they were all spot-on.  Getting ready to change them in another 5,000 miles when I do timing belt, WP, etc. again."
would this fit in my 99 dodge dakota?,If the parts are completely dry and clean for the cost of trying it is worth a try.  If you have a leak in an A/C system it is probably oily from the leakage you are trying to seal and that oil would prevent J-B Weld from sticking to the metal surfaces.  With A/C parts it is best to replace the parts with new ones and then to properly lubricate the O-rings and seals with correct A/C oil.  First be sure to safely remove the refrigerant for recycling and to keep it from destroying the Ozone layer.
Wou;ld you recommend this rack for a Jeep Commander?Longer than most racks? Appearance on vehicle as a daily driver - would it look good?,Being that it is under high pressure I doubt if it will last very long.  You can try.

"Are there any parts available for this horn?

Will it fit a 1997 Ford Expedition?,Yes
Does it fit on an automatic gear shift?,"No, the edge would not provide enough adhesive area. But if you embed a larger metal screen in epoxy and placed it underneath the hole and duct taped it up till it hardened and then filled the top until it was above flush with overlap of the edge it might work."
Can you buy the lens only.  A rock broke mine but everything else is ok,No
i have a 1984 chevy custom deluxe.   i want this whell but will i need an adapter and if so do you have one,yes
This bulb burned out with only 3 1/2 months of use.  Why?,"the best thing is roofing bull and membrain (mesh tape for roofs). spread bull around the edge add mesh tape to cover hole, more bull, more tape, more bull till yopu feel good about it."
Does this product will replace a valve core from a 2007 Lincoln TownCar A/C system. I noticed that Lincoln's valve core are bigger then others.,"I'm sure it would work on a small piece, but I would use some type of construction adhesive over JB Weld for that. If you do decide to use it,make sure you let it set 24 hours to cure before moving or messing with it."
I have a RAM 2013 1500 ST Quade Cab. Will this product fit my mirrors? If so I want to buy them,No. This is really a product to be used where you need high-temperature bonding where metals are involved. Think of JB Weld as a steel epoxy. Cement board would probably be better adhered to porcelain with a construction adhesive. Some of them have much better tack qualities so you can put the cement board in place and it will stay there on its own. JB Weld needs to be clamped in place for 24 hours or so.
Will this model fit a 2006 Ford Explorer?,The answer is yes but I was wondering why you wouldn't use a waterproof construction grade adhesive in will work but you might find it expensive since I really don't know the entire scope of the job I hope this helps I would be more than happy to help further if I get a little more detail about the job hope this is helpful     good luck with your project Gil
will this work on my 28' camper with equalizer hitch,I sincerely doubt it.  It may appear to adhere then when you are feeling satisfied with the project....it falls apart when you least expect it.
does this work on a 2007 hyundai santa fe?,"Clearly & strictly: No - this product is not made for such purposesAs a civil engineer - there are lot of other specific construction adhesives you can select from - you can search in specialized construction store.However - as ""gil"" commented: the scope of job is not clear. Sometimes you need more than adhesion (otherwise it will break or bend) - if you can explain the job more, I think we can give a better advice."
will this work on 1999 nissan frontier 2.4 litre,Yes
"Can you use this on chemically-treated glass shower doors, the kind that are coated?",Yes
"will this work for ""TANK-INNER, G6A-2E, 3E, 6E - WATER HEATER - ATWOOD 91412""?  My tank has 3 threaded ports outside and the hot and cold inside",I would have my doubts.  It didn't work well with heat applications for me.  When it gets too hot it seems to get soft.It may depend on how hot it gets . . . not sure.  I would probably try solder for that. (?)       Dale
chevy 1500 blue smoke coming out right tail pipe(higher rpm) truck is burning oil. put lucas stop leak didnt help. Think this will work any better?,Absolutely.  It is called liquid steel by some.
Is this product biodegradable?,"I think it will. The only problem I see is the heat. JB Weld has held up to everything else I have thrown at it. Balancing its small cost against the risk of failure, my advice is to try it. The worst that can happen is that it doesn't work but you still have partial tubes of the stuff for the future. It is always handy to have around!"
Does this blade fit on 2007 Mercedes C280?,"Very clean smell, not perfume like-doesn't linger. I'll never use Armorall inside my car again."

"Is there a warranty? The listing says so... Some feedbacks say ""NO!""",No real smell at all.  Nice to use.
What size trailer hitch recieiver does the cover fit?,I'm not sure if they changed the formula but mine was  HORRIBLE smell. I use a lot of Megs products and this is the first one I HATE.
can i use in my 2010 mercedes benz GLK350,good.
Is this product for diesel engine as well?,"To me, a very strong smell of vinegar - not a smell I want in a closed space.   I've quit using it."
Does this come with 2 ramps or is this is a per ramp price?,"Even though the Quik Interior Detailer says it is safe for leather, I would check Meguiarsdirect.com under ""interior"" for leather specific products for best results to be safe. They have several around same price-point."
"I see that a tow bracket comes with it, is is difficult to maneuver, will it fit over truck ball? Does it rub the ground while attached to truck ball?","This actually will work fine for most leather interiors.  Most leather interiors in cars are ""coated leather"" and will actually work better with a cleaner like this one."
Will these work on a 2004 Suburban?,"Not this product. This is used for a quick clean on the dash board area. I like it because it leaves a Matt finish not that high gloss like other products spray on swipe of that easy. For leather I recommend mothers ""reflections"" leather care. All the reflections care products I would highly recommend"
What is the depth and width of the planter?,"It primarily is to make matte materials look fairly factory fresh again.  Not sure about chrome add-ons, but it wouldn't hurt those type of surfaces, as it get's exposed on factory chrome interior pieces with no harm.  It's a great product."
can you pull a dodge dakota quad cab with this tow bar?,The natural shine needs a cleaner surface and doesn't last as long. It also attracts more dust.
"Is it the same as those windshield repair kit, can it repair small crack?","I use both products, the quick detailer does not give the sparkle that the shine does. The quick detailer cleans your surfaces while the shine just well just shines.!"
what are the measurement of this ?,"It worked well on the rubber around the doors, mud flaps, hard plastics in the trunk, and the black rubber parts under the hood."
Do I have to buy 2 of these? Or does this include 2 for both sides of the car?,This product is Great when dry fabric looks new. No matte finish. No I have not found anything better.
Hi - what brackets would I need to fit to a 2005 Dodge RAM 1500 SLT Quad Cab?,"I am pleased it helped.  Much respect, IRIE mon!"
Can I use this for my white bag?,It DOES NOT. No greassy or shiny surface with this product. It's great by the way.
Why won't this product ship to my address,"No, it does not leave a slippery surface from what I can experianced."

can i use this for my 2 stroke engine  for my boat,yes you get one bottle.
How meany amps per hour dose it use ?,Yes and I contacted them about the error.
"Is this product toxic?  After it's applied, will the chemical be gone in the air?","Depending on the condition of the paint, you may need to use a light compound to remove any oxidation. I have used a compound called Menzerna, with a high speed buffer. If your paint looks good, you can proceed to waxing with the Collinite 476. Do a section at a time. The wax will give a deep gloss and does seem to last for a very long time. I used it on my boat that was used in saltwater, and it looked great and protected the surface, making it easy to clean after a day of fishing."
Will this stop my launch shudder in the first three gears when I take off with load?  Torque is changing drive shaft u joint angles.,I've had good luck using nufinish polish followed by this Collinite 476. I have also used Colllinite #840 Pre-wax Cleaner and their 870 cleaner wax (separately) followed by the 476 but if your paint is a clear coat Collinite doesn't recommend 840 or 870 on dark colors like yours. I used it on my dark gray 83 RX-7 without any harm so I am not sure why they don't recommend.
I've 2007 Honda Civic EX model. which size should i choose? 22 or 24? and how does operate with a battery/flip of switch?,"Yes, this stuff is awesome! It lasts a long time, so you don't have to keep re-waxing every 3 months. For me, it lasts about a legitimate year on my car, and about six months on my motorcycle. Before you put this on, clean the chrome with some kind of metal cleaner polish, then apply this as a second protective coat. I'm not too sure how long this will last on those parts though, since they are very hot. Hope this helps"
"How many wires are in this ""set""?","I had a black 1979 Harley Fatbob Superglide a long time ago and I used a paste wax once.  I found it got caught in every nook and cranny.  At the time I used Armorall and it worked great.  You just have to make sure not to use any oil on hot pipes as it will ""blue"" them or stain them if not wiped off.  The Collinite (like all pastes) is hard to get out of hard to reach places.  Don't know if this helps or not."
Is this for the front?,There will be no problem using this on your model. Once you use this you will never use another type of wax. I use it on my 2013 Dodge Challenger and 2006 Mustang.
wil this work on my 2003 Hyundai elantra gls? without splicing wires,"Collinite No.476 Super Doublecoat car wax is the only wax I use to protect my vehicles. When used after a cleaner to cleanse the surface, No.476 locks the surface of my vehicles to keep out moisture, dirt , and other contaminents for over a year. I live in Florida, where the sun is absolutely brutal on paint finishes. No. 476 is the best wax I've found so far."
Will this fit a 2000 BMW 323Ci?,no it will work just fine!
will this work in a 1999 gmc suburban k1500 vin # 1GKFK16R7XJ774335. I was told that there are 3 different transfer case for this year suburban.,There is no issue I am aware of...it is just wax.
will this part fit my 96' astro driver's side?,Should be no problem. I have been using this wax since the early 60s on many different cars and paints. I wax my car in the spring and the fall and it has always lasted 6 months. I would be surprised if you were not happy with this product.
does this brake pad fit the 2002 infiniti I35,There are no issues for use on your vehicle.
what is the pre set gap?,"Yes, this is safe for a brand new 2016 Kia Sorento. It is actually one of the more durable waxes we have used."

will these shocks fit my suburban,845 works best for me
"how does amazon handle the lifetime warranty? curious because when you go to the moog website it says to contact supplier, anyone have any insight.",They both last me over 6 months. Go with the one you prefer whether it is liquid or paste.  I think you will be happy with either one. The Collinite Marque D'Elegance lasts me almost a year if you do not mind spending the extra money.
"Picture shows two shocks but ad does not say if price is for one or two. So what is it, 1 or 2 ?","476 is better because it resists sun damage to painted surfaces better than 845 Insulator wax.I live in Southwest Florida, and wax my cars approx. once a year using 476."

I installed Autozone pads on my 2006 Silverado and the dust is really bad! Will these ceramic pads dust my front wheels like the Autozone pads?,After you put the first layer of 845 on and buffet it out then spray the car with cold water to help the wax harden and dry it and keep the car in the shade. Wait one day and then put the second layer of 476 on buffet it out and spray again with cold water and dry it off. This should give you a wax job that should last at least 6 months.
"is it the same threads as the AC Delco GF481, and will it fit a 1989 GMC S-15 jimmy fuel filter ,AC  GF481","To layer use the more durable product (476) first because this is your protective layer that is bonded to the paint the longest. The 845 is a nice wax to top off the 476 wax because it has a warmer shine. The reason why you dont want the 845 as a base layer is because it will lose its bond to the paint after 3-4 months. The 476 as a base layer will last at least 6 months to almost 1 year according to forums. I currently have 2 coats of 476 on my car and I like it. I will admit I do like the 845 shine better, even though the improvement is marginal."

Can this adjust for cold air intake and a cat back exhaust system?,"Don't know about the fit to a Duo Therm, however if you actually have gasket involved in your cover now, then no, it is not correct for your application."
Is this g4 or g5 gear oil i need g4 for older transmission?,Should fit fine. Perfect replacement!
WIll my bike (2008 XL1200C) require a fuelpak or something similar if I install these?  Or will it be good to go once the exhaust is on?,I have a Coleman Mach I air conditioner.  After a hailstorm I had to replace all the vents and A/C shroud.  I replaced it with the Maxxair Tuff/Maxx and it fit perfectly.  Looks great.  I hope this answers your question.
Will these plug wires fit a 2000 Subaru ouback legacy 2.5 liter,It fit my older Coleman. Had to modify the back holes just a little was easy and came out great.
How do we locate the Transmission cooler line fittings?,This unit should fit most every roof air on rv's.  It's a very nice and easy to install!
why does this only say 04-05? 04-08 were all the same body style,"I don't know those modles, but it's the ones that have either 4 bolts sticking out on top of the unit or the newer ones that you screw in to the unit. Sorry couldn't help more than that."
Is this bag fit on my 2009yamaha fz6r,Connie:  Yes it will fit.
I want to be sure is this item fit a 2013 chevy silverado 1500 LT crew cab,This fits Coleman mach 1 and mach 3 11k/ 13.5k/ 15k btu models.
What is the height of the drain pan?,If your shroud bolts on with four bolts on the top I would say yes
"what size is 36"" waist?",I have an older Coleman Mach AC unit but not sure of the model number. I replaced the shroud with the maxxair and it fit almost perfect. The shroud is held on by 4 bolt on the top. I said almost perfect because one of the bolt holes on the shroud didn't quite match up with the old AC unit but i just used my drill and elongated the hole a bit and everything was good.
This part number does not match with the one shown in the picture right?,I bought one for an older coleman and it fit fine.  Looks great.
"The product information/ technical details says these are ""5.6 x 2.9 x 1.5 inches"" are they really that big? If not what are the real dimensions?",No it will not.Need the smaller cover
Whats the size and diameter of the brush?,I do not know the depth specifications of that Emerson.  If it comes down to only being a matter of the screw holes lining up I would say that drilling new ones in the shroud would not be an issue.  The unit is made of tough plastic.
"Is this for the complete front set, drivers and passenger?",I would think that Maxxair would make a cover to fit. You will need to contact someone who sells Maxxair and see what they tell you. Every air conditioner would probably take a different number/design etc. Good luck.
Is the picture accurate? According to the manufacturers website #440852 is the appropriate part for my 2007 Prius Base and includes middle hump cover.,As far as I know it will fit the old Coleman Ac units.
"Is this a 2"" Dent Puller.",I have no idea. The manufacturer should be able to tell you that. Sorry.
how do I know if this is compatible with my Honda Accord?,I have a Mach 1 and it fit perfectly. There are four bolt holes. One on the top at each corner
"Hi, works on a Cherokee Xj 2000 made in Argentina? the Chrysler PIN is 56036862AC! Thanks","Mine is a 7333A881. It has 4 bolt holes, all on top. It was not easy but I called a number on max air website. Had to go through several attempts on telephone prompt. Think I ended up selecting support. Live person was able to take my model and serial and tell me if it would fit. I was still only 50% sure it was gonna fit. I got mine from amazons scratch and dent section for $119 so I was prepared to drill holes to fit. But didn't need drill."
Do the programming instructions come with remote?,As I am laying in bed reading this I don't know my model number but this fit perfect on a Coleman on a 1986 Itasca - nice product
This product made in where?,"It fit my 1987 model perfectly. ""Very old"" isn't very specific."
does this fob have the batteries and chip or are they seperate? do i have to take it to the dealer i wasn't given the original FOB 2002 dodge intrepid,"I put it on a 1985 model. two of the four holes were off by 1/4"" and I had to adjust the holes to make it fit."
I have a 2004 grand prix GTP can I program remote or will it need a locksmith or dealer,The model I installed it on was a 6759C707 on a 1986 Itasca Sunflyer - and like someone else said I had to elongate a coupel of holes by 1/4 inch or but since it is soft plastic you can actually use a knife (drill better)
Would this be suitable for just running some 12v outlets?  How long would it last with a constant 8 amp draw?,Yes. It's required by law to have an anti siphon device whenever hooked to a hose in case the water system looses pressure.
"Hi is this compatible to 2010 4runner LE""",Yes.
"Would this be considered a rotary, dual action, random orbital - polisher?","I dont know.what a backfired shut off is, but it is one way valve. Mine works good does not leak."
gap,No...I don't think so. It just regulates the water pressure going into the camper so as not to burst any water lines.
Will hot water (170 degrees) can off flavors or pull toxins out of the galvanized metal?,"I just did a rough measurement in the dark. Just slightly less than 3"". If you need something more accurate than that I will need to measure during the daylight."
I have an RV with 4 6 volt batteries hooked up in series for 12 Volt and then in parallel to double their capacity.  Can I use it on my system?,"3"", give or take a 32nd."
Will this seat cover fit an 1998 MBZ C230 ?,no
Does it fit well on a 2000 chevy silverado 1500 4x4?,No it is made on it.
On67 ford fairlane 289ci withstandard ignition and risistor wire up under dash. Do I have to remove or bypass it?,"No, but if you turn the filter screen around it will disable the valve."
"What is the Width of the Boot (ie. B=Narrow, C=Avg/Reg, D=Wide, E=Extra Wide) and are these US Sizes?  Thank You.",Hi not really it's kind of molding together. Thank you Carl's RV
How big of a job is it to remove the heat shield to get to the tranny dipstick? 5 minutes?,"Can't answer that for sure but can tell you that it has a 3/4"" hose barb on the back for the hose to hook to."
"Okay, I'm confused. Will ths cover the stake pockets or not? I have a 2009 Silverado Extended cab and 78.7 foot bed. Does anybody else have the this?",No it is the city water connection
I thought I read somewhere that this was a 12 or 24 volt inverter. It did not wwork in my car. What is going on?,"This is a city water inlet connection with a 1/2"" male pipe thread on the back side and a female garden hose fitting on the front side.  I can't say whether this is the fitting that is used on the Holliday Rambler, but, if your goal is simply to connect a water hose to flush the tank(s), then I'm sure that this one could be used.  I found that the flange mounting hole circle was about 2.25"" diameter, so you'll want to be sure that the through hole in the camper side is less than that; say, about 1.75"" diameter, or less."
Will this work on a f150 xlt or is it for a heritage,Probably. It is the same as on the flush on my travel trailer. It connects to a male garden hose.
Will this fit a 2003 Chevy Tahoe and does this product fully function?,"No,this is for input only"
is this a brand new Delco product or is a reman from another vendor?  What is the warranty on this product?,Yes
what are the dimensions of this item?,no check valve
What is the micron rating for this pump?,"My freshwater fill is 4-1/2"" OD (like yours) with 3 screws. However, this city water connection you are asking about is 3"" OD with 3 screws."
CAn you recover freon with this vacuum pump?,"No. What I did was took this piece and inserted it into the original piece. Cut a piece of sheetmetal and drilled the center hole to fit water fitting. Siliconed the flange, and screwed the new flange thru the old one and caught the sheetmetal. Done. Sounds like its hard. Took me 1/2 hour."
Does this work on marine deep cycle batteries?,"No! This has a 1/2"" female hose fitting."
"how do you plug this charger into the ac circuit, I see no ac plug on it...??","Yes, you will have to buy a blowout plug with standard male garden hose threads."
"I notice that the CPS web site shows the hi/lo adapters with a ""CPS"" button label in the center of adjustment knobs.  Are these knock offs ?",Nothing additional needed. This was a perfect replacement for my original fresh water inlet.
"Is this downturn exhaust tip made from stainless steel? Thank you,",It has a sticky tape backing that you peel the paper away from . You first have to clean the area of the tank you will be applying the heater to
"As a newbie to electronics, can this meter be used to test transistors?",it has a adhesive backing
Can tool be used with impact wrench?,Not sure if the backing would need to be taken off and attached to tank for full effectiveness.
Would this tape hold acrylic to wood,I don't see why not . As long as the pad is in constant contact with the tank.
Where is the JDI-6EV unit made?,No..it is not made to have that insulation around it
"Will this one work on 2010 Honda Element? If so, which remote starter will you guys recommend? I don't need it to be a fancy one, no security either","The directs say the following, "" It is recommended that spray-foam insulation be used to cover all tank heaters after installation. ....... other types of insulation may be used as long as edges are securely taped to keep out moisture."""
Is it safe for fiberglass R.V.,"I wish I could help you. It doesn't get that cold normally down here, so I didn't put any thing over it. But, I thought about doing that too.Dave"
I WANT TO PUT IT ON MY motorcycle,I have enclosed belly so i did not need styrofoam. Sorry i couldnt be of further help
How do you bolt these to the frame towards the front of the vehicle when its tubular? I can see it being easy when its chanel frame towards the back.,no. plug only.
Will it fit a 2000 Silverado and does it fit both drivers side and passenger side?,Just the part for the trailer is what came... That would be the one on the left side of the picture there...
what is the diffrance between mastercool 98210a and mastercool accu-charge II . thank you.,No.  The purchase is only the trailer part---to be attached to a cord. The car plug  should be attached permanently to the car---usually by the car maker.
will these work on a 95 nissan pickup?,"No, It is only the trailer part."
will it work on 1995 gmc jimmy 4.3,"As stated in the description, it's 0 to 60psi. You'll damage the gauge using over that."
Where is this item made?,"No,range on the one I have is 0-60 psi. The gauge is made in China and the LCD display doesn't like the cold."
"I have a red car, will this wax be super good for it or probably  any other recommend for me.","no this gauge will not handle that pressure, it is rated 5-60 psi  Accutire makes a heavy duty truck tire gauge  link belowhttp://www.measurement-limited.com/Heavy-Duty-Digital-Truck-Gauge_p_36.html"
Will this work with Coil on Plug ignition systems?,"Not that I am aware of.My only complaint about this gauge is the fact that it is not easy to attach securely to the valve stem. Otherwise I think it is great, but I'm not aware of any other attachments for it."
What's the difference between this and Meguiar's Ultimate Quik Wax? Can both be used for detailing panel and mirror?,The one I bought came as shown with a zippered case. Just found out yesterday it does not like cold weather. Low 40s in my garage and I needed to warm it with my hands for about 15 seconds. You'll like it! Measuring in 1/10 pound increments is really neat!!
What are the dimesions of the battery tray (width & lenght)?,Not sure. I use it just for air monitoring of tires.
Would this work for a 1968 VW Beetle?,"Nothing I know about. But I have found the gauge to be convenient and easy to use. I must admit though, it would be helpful if the stem attachment was at a 45% or right angle when manufactured."
"Camber Arm or Arms? Is this item a set, or do I need to buy two individual arms?",it includes the 3 LR44 batteries needed.
I need it for bike shifters.  I saw on utube them spraying in small area with a spray tube which was not included.  Any ideas?,LR44 1.5V alkaline  3 are required. they are included with the gauge
DO you have to buy the computer too?,Mine came with a battery already installed.  I have not opened the unit to determine the type.
will it fit a 2001 chevy suburban 1500,Not sure didn't look. Yes they are included.  Comes ready to use
"Are these 10MM x 1 threads? My current plugs are, and are ""mini peanut"" size, that's what I need","I am not familiar with different types of valves, but the worst feature of this gauge is attacing it securely in a position that you can read and bleed the pressure. In that respect, it sucks. Otherwise, I like it fine."
"You can put these on without taking the tire off or jacking the car up, correct?",I have no clue what a Presta valve is. sorry.
"You can put these on without taking the tire off or jacking the car up, correct?",very accurate
Can you hardwire these lights to a sub. To get them to flash more accurately to the music.,"This pressure gauge gives me the same readings as a high quality bicycle pump with a built in gauge. As far as it's accuracy is concerned, I've not compared it to a master gauge yet for accuracy."
"I have a 2003 Ford 350 Dually, XLT Super Duty truck that I would like to put this VEL28 tailgate on.  Will this work or do you have another suggestion","It's really hard to tell. The TPM on truck will have 36 psi, Accutire says 34, My tire inflator says 38, Pencil gauge says 32. I use the accutire because it is easiest to read and seems to be at about the average of the other gauges. 2-4 psi difference is really not significant. I wouldn't know where to find an absolute accurate tire gauge."
Will this work for a 2013 Dodge Durango with side airbags?  Is there a place for the headrest to go through?,"I have three very good air gauges.  When I compared them, they all read very similar.  This gauge reads down to the tenth of a PSI so I would say it is the most accurate gauge that I own compared to my other analogue gauges."
I have a 1012 Ford F150 with a jump seat in the middle. Do you know if this would fit?,Yes it does. I have had this gauge for about 4 years and very happy with it.
what is the difference b/n this kit and the Valeo 52285616 SFW Clutch Conversion kit?  The Amazon Parts checker says that I can use both.  Thanks..Pau,"This gauge is accurate, however it must be taken off and back on to get a new reading if you bleed the pressure.  I bought a Joes Racing 32331 Tire Pressure Gauge from Amazon ($88) and it is much better.  Large accurate gauge, easy to read and adjust pressure.  Leave this one alone, it is a car tire gauge and not worth the money.  I gave mine away."
Can these be made secure from theft of contents in bed of truck?,Yes it does
will this fit my 2012 Chevrolet silverado with out any cutting,Yep ..It's easy
Is this device a single 12 volt feed source with 8 separately fused outputs or does each fuse have separate in/out.,Comes with short wiring you'll have to add to wiring depending where your installing it.Instructions included.
Made in USA?,"Kinda. It comes with a short length of wires and vague instructions for installation. Since vehicles aren't supposed to have these, you will probably need to custom install it where you see fit. I had to add my own wire because of the placement of the system so far from my fuse box. Most wolo horns and systems are pretty standard, so you can look online to see what others did for ideas. The instructions tell you what you need to hook up, but like I said, every car is different so you will need to get creative."
Are leads included,No.
What is the CCA?,No it does not. Order the Wolo 840EV. I haven't had any air leaks at all- compressor hasn't been on for around 3 months and the tank is still holding pressure. Make sure you tape your connections and make them tight.
Will it absolutely fit a 2013 Lincoln MKS and a 2013 Lincoln MKX?,no buy seperately
Does this fit my 2006 Mercedes E350 with AMG sports package?,No it doesn't  I don't recommend it leaks air
Will this fit a 2006 Porsche Carrera?,No I have both the compressor and tank mounted horizontally.  The only problem I have is when it freezes the pressure shutoff doesn't work
how many uses (cleanings) come in one,I mounted mine on it's side along the frame of my truck.  I positioned it close to a body mount bracket to reduce the water that may splash into the intake part of the compressor. It's loud though try to isolate it the best you can.
"Would this be suitable to install in a sailboat (to power 3 small lights)?  In particular, I wonder if heeling would be an issue (tipping to a side)?",It's installed on the frame under my truck but for sure it's less than 24 inches long x 6 in dia.  It is only 5.5 liters.
"Description say this is 0-35 psi, but picture shows guage is from 0-15psi. which is correct?","Shouldn't be a problem fitting it in the truck. I'm not where I can be measure right now, but my memory is about 5 1/2"" in diameter and about 16"" long. It has two feet spot-welded on it with holes drilled for mounting flat - if possible. My problem has not been either the tank, or the compressor, but the horns themselves are very large an irregularly shaped. That's the bad. The good is that the suckers are LOUD!!!"
Does this wheel bearing fit my honda civic 98 EX?,"George, it is exactly 18L x 5H x 5.5W.  With the Siberian express train horns (loudest Wolo makes) it can blast for 18 seconds straight. Want an honest opinion  though? Do not but anything from Wolo. That was my mistake twice. The first thing I got from them was a horn/compressor combo (a small all attached one) I had to send it away to them after 4 months and it took them 6 to finally tell me it couldn't be fixed. I got my money back from the retailer. Then I bought this off of amazon. The first tank I got had a hole in it out of the box! I got a new one a couple weeks later (takes a while to get to Canada) and it was fine. Then after a couple months the compressor went. So I called amazon and they sent me a new set. I now have It mounted in the tool box of my truck and it hasn't faulted so far. However, the rivets Wolo uses on the horns are metal, they rust which I've just found out. It was a stupid design idea to put metal rivets on something that is exposed to the elements and salty roads come winter. Not sure what I'm going to do about that. So my advice is to go with horn blasters. They're better quality and will last a lot longer. I went with this kit because it's cheap but have had nothing but issues. Oh, one more thing. When it hits -20 degrees Celsius the horn solenoid freezes up and you have no train horn.

can i use this for airbrush,Yes
Are both sides included or do you have to order two?,It'll spill.
"This says two door, but will it fit in the front of a four door unlimited 2009?",I think you would need very steady hands to do that.  You would be able to pour liquid into a 5-gallon bucket quite easily.  This is a well made pan that will last for years.
does it fit 1998 suburban,Use a funnel and it's not too bad. You will have to clean up a little bit of oil so I do it over cardboard.
do these fit either side and are they black,I poured oil out of this pan into a 1 quart popcorn can with no problem.  I haven't tried to pour into anything smaller.
Can I use my chrome lug nuts?,"Well made sides that will not collapse as you hold it to pour. I poured it into a container VERY SLOWLY, with mouth size of a gallon milk jug. I missed a bit getting it started, that's why I say SLOWLY. I used a funnel the next time."
what does it connect to? the 12v socket in the car or the car's battery? Got it solved. Thanks to all who posted,No idea. I use them to contain coals for Dutch oven cooking.

Does this properly fit a 2014 Polaris Ranger-400 MID SIZE UTV?,Line with aluminum foil and it will work fine
is this battery powered or plug in?,"No, My first impression would be that because of the thickness of the metal it would be unsuitable. Too flimsy to move around depending the weight you have in it. With the heat I would imagine it would warp."
"Can this unit be added to? I need something big enough, affordable to start a build into a larger system.","I have used this method; in fact I have 2.  They work very well for corralling the coals and, additionally, the sidewalls do a great job of concentrating the heat upward around the oven.  I use it on the dirt by itself.  If I use it on grass, I put a couple of concrete step stones under the pan to keep from scorching the grass. In effect, you also have your own built-in wind screen, too.  Hope this helps."
What is the size of this cushion?,"Yes I can fit up to my 16"" dutch oven in it but to get more air under the 16"" dutch oven I've learned to turn it over and place oven on top.  I am looking to buy a new one as I came across your question."

"rechareger of 500amp battery jump was missing, need order one",You can check one of these out at a Tractor Supply Store if there is one near you and purchase for less than $4.
how long is the cord,Yes it is
"How tall is this ladder? Per description, only 39""?","Inside diameter is about 15-1/4"" and the exterior diameter (has a top lip) is about 16-1/2""."
how long are they,15 inch diameter.
"The picture shows above the rail portion that is not ""low profile"" when the description states low profile series.",Its put away at this time. But you don't want to put it under your car. the diameter is too small. And the depth is too shallow.  I use it to drain the oil from my motorcycles. Its perfect for that.
Is this liquid nirogen?,About 16 inches
I have a 2010 Ram 1500 Quad Cab with a plastic bedliner. Will this work if I cut out the mounting location bracket areas?,I dont think so it has a problem fixing smaller scratches in my headlights.
Would these fit a 1995 325is 2-door coupe (not convertible)?,NO.
are these sold in pairs or individually??,"The product helps with minor scratches, but is not very effective with deeper gouge.  it may just make the scratch smother."
is this the replacement for remote starter model 5301,"This will work with any colour but actual paint missing from a finish has only one fix, getting the panel repainted!"
is it carb exempt in cali?,The question is incoherently written.  Please reword and I'll try to answer.
Is this the Pro Dry or Pro 5 (oiled) version?,"I don't think so. It hardly worked on metal.The scratches can not be deep at all, for any product like this to work.I was not pleased."
Will this fit over Husky Weather Beater floor liners?  The liners mold to the lip but extend a little higher (about an inch) than the floor.,Don't know. I used it to take out minor scratches from my car and it did a good job.
"Is this mat light gold color or dark. Our rig has this design on it in gold, grey ,tan and black",it didn't work very well for me at all
Can I walk over a roof trated with this paint?,I've found that it's easier to wipe off if you don't let it sit too long. I let it sit for about 30 seconds and wipe it off when I let it sit to get the haze they describe in the bottle it was extremely difficult to remove.
would this fit my 5speed 2.5l wrx?,On a black finish. 4 hrs with a buffer and turtle wax polish compound.
Can you clean the power core filters or would you have to buy a new one of you want to clean it?,The polish comes off very easily. Just rub a towel over it. It is the best car polish I have ever used.
Do you know if the velcro straps are long enough to fit under the seat and on top of tank of a BMW F800 GS ADV which has wider thank with luggage rack?,When the polish dries and turns white. Good luck.:-)
Does it have the VW logo on it?,"Depends on the size of the vehicle.  A large SUV or pickup truck would take maybe 1 1/2 hours to do it correctly.  A smaller sedan maybe 1 hour.  Nu Finish goes on and wipes off easy compared to many of the paste waxes I have used before.  It also seems to last as long as a good paste wax, maybe longer."

"is this for a single cover, or is it a pair?",soon as it dries you can take it off. I usually wax about 25% of the car the I take it off.
Will this fit a 2010 Dodge Challenger with manual transmission?,"There's no doubt about it - you must clean (i.e. wash with water) the car to remove all dirt, grease etc - I use a small amount of detergent in the water too. The results of the nu-finish are fantastic -  I've been using for three years and have used the polish three times and it lasts for a full twelve months each time"
"so, these are for the tailgate, not the glass, right?","In my opinion, you absolutely need to wash the car first."
What is the extended length of this lift?,Always best to wash first if you have the resources to do so.
Is this fits in my Hyundai Accent 2004?,"I'd say that's probably the best way to go.  If the car isn't actually DIRTY, just dusty, you could MAYBE get away with using one of those quick detailer products, then waxing, BUT I'VE NEVER DONE IT THAT WAY.  I'd say give it a try on a SMALL, INCONSPICUOUS area, like maybe a bumper corner...  If it works, GREAT!  If it doesn't work, then at least you haven't wasted the time and effort, and/or ground dirt into your paint.  I always wash the car first - with water and car-wash soap (Nu-Finish Car Wash of course) - rinse it off, probably more than I should, followed by using a super-flexible car care squegee to get most of the water, then towel-drying the rest, followed by waxing.  You don't actually NEED to squeegee the car, but I find it saves towels.  Yes, it takes time, but if you get through first time, following washes/waxes are easier.This may sound a bit off, but if you're pinched for washing, maybe hit one of those touchless car washes, or at least a coin-op place.  Main thing is for the car to be clean, so you're not griding grit into it.  Oh, and just in case you're REALLY new to this, DO NOT - EVER! - JUST DRY-WIPE THE CAR!  That WILL scratch up the paint.  In that case, you'd be better off to just leave the thing dirty.  Your paint will still look bad, but at least it will save you time/effort/money.

"So what base plate fits a 1995 Dodge Dakota? Every plate I look at says it won""t fit. Thanks",I usually clean with soap and water and then dry it and then apply it. This gives a better shine and cleaner look
Can I use this oil filter for 2008 BMW 328i,"Yes and no. It is a protector and polish. My tumbler holds 6 lbs of 50% corn cob / 50% walnut media. I add 3-4 tablespoons of mineral spirits for cleaning and 3-4 tablespoons of NuFinish to each batch of brass I tumble unless I have more than one batch to tumble, then its every 3 batches. You will know when to add more. When you add it let the tumbler run for about 10 minutes before you add the brass. You need to have no clumps in it or it will get inside the brass and dry up. I also toss in a few cut up used dryer sheets to control dust."
will this fluid damage my silicone wiper blades?,"Yes, I use a capful for every time I tumble. I mix the brass with the media and them pour it on top, if your pour it on the brass, you will get a gummed up mess."
"I have an LT-285/70R17 tire, 32.5""dia.x11 width. Can I get an Eagle #6 tire cover?","Are you asking if it can be added to tumbling media like corn or crushed walnut shells to clean brass? That's a good question! I am not sure but the consistency may be to thick for the media to completely remove it all. I would say to try it with a few pieces before you do it in a mass quantity just to make sure. Its a great polish so theoretically I would say it should work fine as a cheaper alternative to cleaning brass... I think however it would be more of a protectant to your brass than a polish in the end..Just not sure if the media can remove all the polish to be honest. You may be doing some extra hand polishing in the end... Let us know if you try it and share your results...

"So this Kit comes with 2 pair of ""A"" bars and the kicker? Or what you get is what is exactly in the picture? besides the light bar",This may work better to PROTECT brass. I don't consider it a cleaner however.
Will it fit on a 2014 FJ Cruiser?,What in the world are you talking about?
Is this model both gas and 110 v electric,Are you asking if I have used this to clean brass? The answer is no. There are cleaners specially made to clean brass. I suggest you try one of them.
Are these only for towing and hauling?,"I apply by hand and remove using a flat wide microfiber floor duster on the large flat areas and hand buff in the irregular areas e.g. around windows, hitch, bumper etc.. This might help if you don't have a orbital buffer. Also the floor duster with the handle helps in reaching the high spots without moving a ladder every 2 feet."
will the motorcraft tpms 19 remote tire pressure sensor work on 2005 ford explorer,For waxing something big (an RV or a boat) the pros are using a BIG random orbital buffer (say 10 inches). Is still a big job but easier than by hand.
Picture shows curved blades however the man. # listed here PC-2052 is for the straight version on their web site. What was delivered?,"trust me- you DO NOT need anything other than this product to protect and shine! Our 6 yrs old cars look brand new- we just sold our 4 yr old sailboat, and we put a coat of this on the boat top to bottom 4 times a yr and everyone still thought it was brand new.

Polishing a car for example, especially dark/Black cars that have some light swirling (Spider webs) & light scratches NEED MUCH MORE THAN NU-FINISH. Now, there are 4 steps to properly ""detail""(Polish/Wax/Simonizing) any paint-maintained vehicle. They are Washing/drying, pre-cleaning, POLISHING FOR SHINE, & finally WAXING FOR PROTECTION/SEALING.Using just 1 product of ANY BRAND will not accomplish much EXCEPT TO THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW BETTER. Nu-Finish is the only Car Polish that for years had tremendous Marketing benefits, mainly their junkyard before & after commercials. So, people believed what they saw, purchased this product & GOT THE RESULTS THEY WERE HOPING FOR, just like in the commercial. However, the commercial never would dare put an infrared light & closeup shot of the REAL RESULTS. What we would have seen was a dull, swirl-marked ""Dead"" finish. Clever, yes indeed-comparing 1 totally oxidized/weathered & ruined side next to a freshly polished side. Had they shown a new car hood next to the ""Nu-Finished"" side, then your eyes would tell your brain that it was all just an illusion.So, let's start with say, a 2 year old car that was only washed thru automatic car-wash places. Black finish. What you have is a car with fine ""Swirls/scratches/spider webs"" & some noticeable scratches. Use only Nu Finish & you'll get a great shine, but nothing more. All of the damage I mentioned will still remain. Use Nu-Finish right out of the showroom on a brand new car & micro-fiber CLEAN cloths to wipe it off (And ONLY HAND WASH!), & you'll always have a ""Like new"" paint job. ANYTHING OTHER THAN THAT, NU-FINISH IS SIMPLY A SEMI-ABRASIVE POLISH & SYNTHETIC ""PROTECTOR"", and there are dozens of 2 to 4 step products that if used on 2 exactly the same condition vehicles like the one I created here, & Nu-Finish will not even come close to the other vehicle's results IN ANY WAY.And to answer your question which you can do a search on, asking ""The difference between Polishing & Waxing"", you will learn that POLISHING IS FOR SHINE/fine scratches ETC.& WAXING IS FOR SEALING IN THAT SHINE-BUT DOES NOT ADD SHINE. WHEN USING THE CORRECT 4 STEP PROCEDURE & TOP-RATED PRODUCTS which are inexpensive & much better quality products like Meguiars, Griots, Pinnacle, and yes, TURTLE WAX PRODUCTS STILL AMONG THE BEST (SEARCH FOR THEM AS WELL. NU-FINISH IS NOT ON EVEN 1 PROFESSIONAL ""TOP 10 CAR POLISHES"" LIST!), you will not believe the difference. Whoever uses this product & is happy with the results is either brainwashed by the commercial, used it from the beginning & tried nothing else (""Professional"" or high-end), or THINKS they cannot get better results from anything else. Spend a TOTAL of say 30.00 on a well-known Pre-wax cleaner/Polish/Swirl mark remover & Wax and do 1/2 your hood with those, 1/2 with Nu-Finish. Only then will you see what you're missing, & IT'LL BE LIKE NIGHT & DAY!

Anybody put this on an '05 Cooper hard top?,I don't think you will need another product for the shine.
is this for one or two bulbs?,"I can't speak for what you've ""heard"", but seeing is believing.  Everything I've ever used it on had a great shine that always made people ask what I use.  It keeps paint looking glossy and brand new.  I've never used anything with Nu Finish, but from what I've read a wax won't really stick on top of it.  I don't think it would work too well the other way around either.  Give Nu Finish a try.  If you don't like the finish, strip it off and use something else.  I think you'll be happy with it though.  Good luck."
doo you really need longer shocks on an 1997 f-150 2 wheel drive  ??  What else do you need for instalation,"While many say you don't need to add wax, you can most definitely wax the car after Nu Finish has cured (which I would wait at least a day since the bottle doesn't mention curing time).Nu Finish isn't technically a polish - it is a sealant. Applying wax on top will add to the overall depth and shine."
Does this come with the mirror glass?,"Hi Donna, Not only do I use it all over on my cars, but on my RV and beautiful Grumman Tiger (plane).Further, I use Nu Finish on my glasses, and on silver to protect the finish.The stuff goes on easily, and wipes off with a soft cotton cloth or those micro fiber cloths.Ron Millman, CPA, Glendale, CA"
Are screws included,"No,  keep every type of wax from porous bumpers. You would spend a fair amount of time removing the haze that would develop if you were to apply wax to it."
If I buy these bags will I also need to buy the saddle bag support kit?  I'll be putting these bags on a Harley Fat Boy.  Thanks,"Hi: I assume you mean painted bumpers?? If so, then yes this wax is fine. If you are speaking of a bumper that is like flat black with a textured finish then no. For material like that you would be good with some type of vinyl protectant."
"What is 6000k and 8000k different ?  Does 6000k whiter and brighter than 8000k ? My current is 6000k (other brand) but others car look extremely brighter than mine , what is the factor please ?",It can be used only on painted bumpers. It will stain the black plastic bumpers forever.

Most ""waxes"" like Nu Finish have some polishing compound in them but it is usually not very aggressive and won't help an extremely dull paint.

You will see the color of paint on the rag you are using to polish, rub or wax. That is what is supposed to happen.  Hand rubbing a finish is a lot of work.  If that doesn't work, or is just too much work, you should machine buff the car. If there is any good paint below the oxidized layer that should do the job. For any of the products mentioned apply as per the instructions on the can.  DO NOT apply a polishing compound after waxing.  That will just take the protective wax off.

will they fit 1998 ford xlt 2 wheel drive.,"This is the instructions I found on dicor's website hope it helps.BRITE-PLY ROOFING SYSTEM RETRO-FIT INSTALLATION GUIDE The instructions contained herein are guidelines for installing BRITE-PLY EPDM rubber roofing on older RV's. When applied using the proper techniques, materials, and tools, the BRITE-PLY roof should provide years of dependable, trouble free performance. To ensure proper warranty coverage, you should adhere to the installation techniques and materials described in this installation guide. Use of other procedures and products may jeopardize your warranty coverage.Note: Read fully and understand the procedures before beginning installation.1. Tools and Materials: A. Waterbased adhesive (901-BA) is applied to a wood substrate with a roller. The BRITE-PLY roofing is applied while the adhesive is still wet. B. Butyl tape (BT-1834) must be under all vents and accessories on the roof and termination moldings that contact the EPDM roofing. Butyl tape should also be used under the EPDM membrane where it comes in contact with the unit body at the front, rear, and side terminations. C. Lap sealant (501-LS) is a self-leveling caulk used to seal screw-type fasteners and termination moldings, formulated especially for BRITE-PLY EPDM roofing. D. Paint roller (not supplied) should be 9"" wide short nap type. Used to apply waterbased adhesive (901-BA). E. Push broom or squeegee (not supplied) used to remove air pockets and ensure that the EPDM membrane is completely in contact with the adhesive. F. Caulking gun (not supplied) used to apply lap sealant (501-LS). G. Roof decking (substrate, not supplied), depending on the roof load requirements, should be at least 1/8"" luan plywood. If the load requirements are heavy (storage pods or consistent traffic) a minimum of 1/2"" plywood is recommended. In most new unit applications, 1/4"" luan or plywood is the minimum material used, while 3/8"" material is more prevalent.NOTE: Dicor does not warrant selection of substrate material. Feel free to contact Dicor with any questions.2. Cleaning Information: You will notice a powdery, white talc on the surface of your BRITE-PLY EPDM roof membrane. This talc is used in the manufacturing process of the membrane. While this talc will not interfere with the performance of your BRITE-PLY roof, and it will eventually be removed by the natural elements, it is recommended that you clean the membrane within a week after installation.BRITE-PLY EPDM roofing can be cleaned with Dicor Rubber Roof Cleaner. For stubborn stains, products containing mineral spirits are recommended. Do not use Acetone or Citrus Cleaners. Do not let any cleaning solvent come in contact with the membrane for extended periods of time. Because dust and dirt may collect on the roof, regular cleaning with Dicor's RP-RC160C or RP-RC320S Rubber Roof Cleaner is recommended. Do not park vehicle for extended periods where roof will be exposed to tree sap or fruit as staining may result. A soft bristle brush may be used during cleaning.Preparation 1. Remove all appliances, vents, moldings, etc. that may inhibit the current roofing material from being removed. 2. Evaluate the old roof. BRITE-PLY roofing must have a sturdy foundation. Determine if the entire roof should be removed, or if the addition of decking (substrate) will be sufficient. Remember that the substrate must be securely fastened on all edges and seams. 3. Either remove the old roof or apply the substrate over the old roof, if removal will create structural damage. 4. When applying the substrate, make sure it extends to the edges of the roof. Also, make sure all seams are tight and as level as possible. The substrate should be applied using screw-type fasteners with screw heads level or slightly below the surface of the substrate. All substrate seams should be on a rafter for necessary support and to reduce the possibility of ""seam separation"". If seams are wider than 1/16"" you may want to bridge seams with Dicor Fleece Tape 511FT. Additionally, if on the roof edge, the membrane will be going over a sharp edge, you should either bevel the edge of the substrate with a sander or place the Dicor Fleece Tape 511FT over the edge to protect the membrane from the edge. 5. Route-out or cut all vent and appliance openings. 6. Broom or blow-off of substrate all foreign materials and check entire roof for exposed screw heads or sharp objects that may prematurely wear the BRITEPLY roof.Installation 1. Locate the ends (front and rear) where the BRITE-PLY roof will be terminated. Use a chalk-line to mark these areas. Make sure there is sufficient roof structure to fasten to. 2. Cover the roof with the BRITE-PLY membrane making sure there is sufficient length at both the front and rear termination points. Fold membrane in-half, exposing the roof areas. 3. Open the waterbased adhesive (901-BA) and stir thoroughly. Using a 9"" wide short nap paint roller, apply adhesive to the substrate at a rate of 160 sq. ft. per gallon. The membrane is to be mated with the adhesive as quickly as possible.4. Fold the membrane the opposite direction and repeat step #3. 5. With the membrane in place, adjust to make sure there is sufficient length at both termination points and on both sides of the vehicle. Remove wrinkles by lifting and pulling the membrane. Do not stretch the rubber membrane. 6. Lightly squeegee or broom to eliminate air pockets, making sure the membrane is completely in contact with the adhesive. 7. Apply butyl tape (BT-1834) to the side of the roof edge molding. While holding the molding, draw surplus material tight with a downward pull. (You may staple the membrane in-place spacing 1/2"" staples 3-5"" apart to keep proper tension.) For best results, install this molding from the center of the vehicle toward the ends. When complete, use a utility knife to cut surplus material from below the molding. Repeat on opposite side.NOTE: It may helpful to strike a chalk line to assist in keeping the side-body molding straight and in proper position.8. Apply butyl tape (BT-1834) to the termination molding. On the front, the front cap should lay on top of the membrane. Using a screw-type fastener, install the termination moldings - making sure there is sufficient roof structure. On the rear of the vehicle, the membrane should lay on top of the rear cap.NOTE: Butyl tape should also be used under the EPDM membrane where it comes in contact with the unit body at the front, rear, and side terminations. See all termination drawings for correct butyl placement. 9. Using a utility knife ""X"" cut all roof openings. Make sure all openings are cut the same size as previous openings. Round all 90 degree cuts to eliminate ""running cuts"". Surplus material should be stapled inside vent openings. Do not stretch the rubber membrane. Trim all excess material. 10. Apply butyl tape (BT-1834) to all appliances, vents, etc. Re-install using screw-type fasteners. When installing the vents, appliances, etc. you may notice that the BRITE-PLY membrane near the screws begins to ""creep"" and small air pockets form. Simply ""walk"" the bubble toward the opening and hold-in-place while installing screw-type fasteners.Caulk all screw heads, front and rear termination bar and all accessories.Note: Only Butyl Tape can be used with Brite-Ply membrane to assure proper seal. 11. Install lap sealant (501-LS) using a 1/4"" to 3/8"" bead, as follows: A. Bridging the membrane on all appliances. B. Both ends of the front and rear termination molding. C. Top edge of side roof edge molding. D. All screw heads located on the roof.NOTE: Do not use silicone - it will not adhere to the EPDM rubber. 12. Clean all surplus caulk and debris from the roof.NOTE: If the unit has a fiberglass or metal side radius cap, a bonding adhesive may be used in these areas. Normally, pulling the membrane tight under the side edge roof molding will be sufficient. If you determine a bonding adhesive is necessary, please call Dicor for additional information.

are these a complete assy.w/adjusters and mounts,No they are an automotive 12 volt light bulb
are these the U.S. spec head lights which are blacked around chrome bezel or are they all  chrome around whole head light?,Round base push and twist to install. Like old style automotive bulbs.
by purchasing the wheel for $143.23 do you get the set of $ wheels?,"Try looking in the product description, it's there. Here, I copied and pasted it for you: 11 1/2""L x 4""W x 1 9/16""H"
did the wheel come with center cap?,"I just sold the camper I put them in. They worked really good.  The approximate size is 5"" x 11"".This is from memory."

"I have a black Sentra, will this be in black or will I have to paint it","This light is normally used in an RV interior and is a standard size for a two bulb set up. I suppose the presumption is that if you are replacing one then this will fit in its place. Without more explanation, I don't really understand your question."
What is the return policy? (In case it doesn't fit...),"Yes, Dennis. There are two wires(black and white) that match the internal wires. The four screw holes should match up. The switch runs one, two or both lights."
The discription says there are 25 symbols but the question related to symbols states none. which is correct?,"Yes, the new fixture is very similar to my old fixture, with two lenses (lights and covers), with a selector switch in the middle, between the lights.

I am a female around 100 lbs. Will I be able to use this with ease?,"On my 1970 camaro, the rear are leaf springs and the front are springs. Thus, you only need 2 springs. On quite a few cars that have leaf springs they do not have rear springs. This is common for solid rear axle cars."
If this switch needs to be replaced what are the symptoms?  Would the FL light flicker or in some case not turn on?  I am trying to diagnose a problem with my current light,If you have a 2nd generation camaro they only have coil springs in the front and a rear leaf spring. So having 4 springs would be useless l. And this application is for 2nd generation camaros and I'm sure a few other cars as well. It's as universal
how many total  amps does this inverter?,Go to eibach's web site and check your vehicle applications then take the part # for your car and match it up to make sure you get the right one. That's what I had to do to be sure.
"We have a Badlands universal remote for our Chicago wench. The remote had a hook up for 5 prong and the wench is a 3 prong, Is there an adaptor????","Eibach products have suspension parts for most cars on the road today, go to their website put in your year, make and model and they should have it.

Will it charge just one 12 volt battery,"as long as you tell them to fit a 2005 300, make sure you give them motor size.  I would highly recommend it for any car the ride is so much better then stock.  you will notice a big difference"
Any difference in model years that would cause this not to fit a 2013 (as 1 review says)? Are any brands less visible from the back?,yes
What is the brand name for this parts? Is that Eagle eye?,"No. Please read the applications. They are for early Fox Mustangs. There is no way these would fit a Lexus, nor would they be rated for same."
Can it fit 2007 Nissan quest?,"Sorry. My mistake. I don't know why Amazon thinks I bought these. I bought Eibach lowering spings for my 1985 Mustang GT.

Will 6000K still look whiter than 4300K or 5000K? I'd like to have the brightness of daylight at night. Thanks all.,Today at 11:25 AM   I don't have Bosch brand. I do have a set in Prestolite part number 118064I'm having email issuesSorry
Can this be used on wheel bearings?,I do not know. I have a 6.0 liter  2009.
does the kit come with the catalytic converter gasket,this is only 5.3 lt engine. if this is your engine is good.
How quiet or loud is it?,"Yes I put on 2004 5.3 Avalanche,And very good Wires."
Does this kit come with the pictured book type color application manual?,What year?
Is there any way to ship to Canada? Thanks in advance.,I installed these on a 2005 Chevy Suburban which is pretty much the same platform so I think you should be safe.
"My bike chain is rusty, and I was thinking of trying out something like this. Would this work for parts that move and interlock with each other?",The chevy avalanche is the same thing as a silverado. So yes they will fit just fine.

      « 

Show Less",Yes they will fit all v8 gm trucks 01 to 13
Does the 5 foot extension come with end caps?,"No, this sensor is bank 1 sensor 2. It's not the same."
Is this for 98 toyota camry and power ?,"Go to your local auto parts store and have them tell you the part number you need.  This will tell you if you have the right part or not.  If you have a harbor freight in the area, you might need the removal tool.  Some parts store will loan it to you.  It's like a spark plug socket with a slit in it that allows the wire to fit while you un-tighten.  Be sure to use anti seize lube on the threads before you replace.  It will help remove down the road."
"Corolla 2007:Drive side is ok (3 bolts), fits well. Passenger side is wrong ( 2 bolts). I had to return RH. Can you suggest compatible RH product?",I'm not sure. I bought this sensor for a different vehicle (Toyota tundra). I think you can do a search on Amazon's web site and figure out the part number. You could also go to auto zone and ask what part you need and then use that info to buy the part from Amazon
"My Jeep does not have fog lamps, but there are holes in the bumper for them. Do I need anything else to install these besides wire and switch??","Don't know.  Probably not.  I used mine in a V-8 pickup.Look for your Bosch part here,http://www.boschautoparts.com/VehiclePartFinder/Pages/VehiclePartFinder.aspx"
Will this fit a 2013 Ford Explorer?,I really cannot answer your question. I purchased this sensor for Toyota Tundra with a V8 engine. Sorry I couldn't give you more help.
"Will this work for french cars (Peugeot, Renault, Citroen etc.)?",On a Toyota Sequoia this part is for Sensor 1 on both Bank 1 and 2.  Sensor 1 is closest to the engine and a bitch to remove.  Borrow a special wrench from Autozone for free.  They were also able to tell me exactly which sensor to replace and the part so I could buy it for half off here on Amazon.
where is it made?,As far as I can recall these are not interchangeable.
Battery Charging Does the battery automatically charge when you plug it in to the computer via USB or do I have to buy the charger seperate.,without knowing what vehicle it fits it is hard to answer.  From what I can find they are not interchangeable.  I would recommend looking up the sensor you need on Bosch's O2 sensor application guide online.
How can I install the TYC 12-5100-01 Chevrolet Driver Side Replacement Parking/Signal/Side Marker Lamp Assembly?,"Very easy installation. The hardest thing was loosing the clip. I had also purchased the sensor removal socket which worked great! I saved over $400.00. That is what I was told that it would cost to service the ""SERVICE \CHECK ENGINE LIGHT"""
"Headlight assembly look black or gray, are they?","you did mean LX470, installation is easy, you do not need to buy the sensor removal tool, you can get it as a loaner from your local auto store.."
is this the 1/4 turn cap,Does it fit a LS430?  Don't know.  I used it on a Toyota Pick-up truck.  The Bosch website has the compatibility catalog I referenced before buying this item.
Does this come with lids?,On my 2002 Tundra it was the Upstream sensor on the passenger side.
Size of the cover,"On my 2000 Toyota Tundra V8, it was the upstream sensor.  If the Sequoia has a 4.7L V8, it is probably the same."
Is this tape vinyl or cloth webbing?  Thnaks,on my 2000 tundra..it's located before catalytic converter ..But I'm not sure on sequoia
"Will this work to repair scratches/discoloration on plastic eyeglass frames?  Not the lenses, but the frames.",This listing comes with a one year manufacturers warranty.
is it 1 or 2 pieces ? back and bottom,"Don't remember, it's been running over a year with no problems.  The alternator arrived on time, it appeared brand new.  Works as advertised.  I would recommend this Bosch alternator."
Will this fit my 2014 Toyota Highlander? And do I need an already existing roof rack?,Bosch provides an Unlimited Mileage Lifetime Warranty on all new Alternators.  See:  http://www.boschautoparts.com/documents/11100/0/0/9769b052-178c-434d-8301-136ff172fdfd
Does anyone know if these pipes fit a 2015 Road King,Its 90 AMP and perfect fit to my Jeep Wrangler 97 TJ. Only I changed my old alternator pulley to this new one. that's all.
will this work on a 2014 Camaro SS 1LE/RS manual transmission car,"I agree with Ayesh, swap your pulley over and you will be good to go."
Is it water and sand proof for the beach?,"According to Centric ( who i believe more than Amazon) , an 06 Civic EX uses a 120.40056 front rotor and a 120.40040 rear rotor.  An 06 Civic GX uses a 120.40036 front rotor and a rear DRUM-no rotor. My belief is with Centric's chart more than Amazon's chart but I am not the ultimate expert - just a pretty good DIY  guy.  Remember my suggestion regarding the Phillips retaining screws - it saves you a ton of grief."
Is this removable,And ya there's two different parts.. I checked on centric because the first one I bought were for the rear disc. So look online and see which number it is for your car
What is the dimensions of Presto Fit 2-203 jumbo radius wrap around covers,"I purchased Centric rotors for my 2003 accord, but before doing so I went to a few other sites like autopartswearhouse or brake world and found the actual part number to see if Amazon's would match. The part finder on Amazon isn't always correct. There's time when Amazon would claim ""this part does not fit"" when in fact it will and other times when the opposite is true."
This polisher is 120v-240v? Thanks,Hi if the pads still good you can use them..rotors are all stock size no different from eom. These rotors are the same material cast iron..you should have no problem. I hope this help.thanks Anne
"Is this a wireless system,  it was shown in my wireless search",I have used Wagner Pads with these rotors only because they are half the price of Honda Pads but these are great rotors and I see no issues with using Honda Pads
I weigh 330(give or take a few lbs). Would you recommend this for me? I don't need a bunch of speed. Would it pull me up a slight hill?,No issues - use them.
Does this charger stop charging automatically when the battery is charged?,I think it good for that!!
Do these come in white?,DO NOTTTTTTTT BUY THESE!!! These only lasted me 3 months. There not premium rotors. You'll just waste your money. After I took em off I went to autozone and got me ceramic rotors and ceramic pads. They stop better and so far lasted me a while plus 3 year warranty
How long is the cable which connect with the cigarett lighter? Thank you,"This rotor is perfect fit  my 2005 Accord LX i4. The black coating does good job no rust. It is OK for daily driving. Since, you got the Honda factory pad, just go ahead to install. My original Honda pad last up to 90k miles from new. However, my 09 Civic only last 40k miles. Just keep your eyes on them periodically. You may keep the old rotors  n turn it for the next  brake job. O'Reilly auto asking $10 each for the turn rotor service."
Does this include the driver side and passenger side mats?,"Same here, less than a year and is rusting. Actualy, hasnt even seen a winter yet! Be nice to really find an American made rotor these days and one that doesn't rust."
How much higher does this lift the tire vertically?,no but make sure you replace both. these are very good quality and a much better price than you could get at a parts store.
will it fit 8 hp,Never saw them sold in pairs.  Excellent value - check out my Honda hints to keep from going crazy changing these rotors.
Do these fit over original rock rails?,No
does product come with 1 or 2 straps?,"No, just one."
"Could this work on a 1974 CB550K? I understand it wouldn't be plug and play, but could it work?","Go to ""centricparts.com"" - on the left is a box ""select your vehicle"". enter your detailed Honda Pilot information and you will then know for sure which rotor is correct for your Pilot."
What is the wattage?  They could have stated it...Need for replacement cabin light in boat...a 921 --7 watt.,We used on 2005 accord
are there different baffles for sound?,Probably not. Every car has it's own size. U might want to check it first when it asks you what kind of car you have
Will these work on a 2004 Hyundai Santa Fe?,Not sure about 2010 models. I had no problem installing it on my 03 Accord coupe.
where is this made?,"Go to centricparts.com to confirm but according to them, all LX/LX-P use this rotor.  This was a superior rotor to original Honda rotors.  Since you have a 2010, the two screws holding the rotor on may not be heat welded to the rotor but I STRONGLY, STRONGLY recommend two things to make your life MUCH better: A) order an impact driver Powerbuilt 648002 1/2-Inch Drive Impact Driver Kit for about $12 from Amazon when you buy the rotors.  If you strip the Phillips screws (as VERY often happens with a regular screwdriver), you will have a TON of frustration trying to change the rotors. 2) take the screws to a GOOD hardware store (Ace, True Value, etc.) that has a huge assortment of screws.  Get a HEX DRIVE metric screw to put in the place of the STUPID Phillips screws - they can be a longer length than the factory screws - no problem.  USE ANTI SEIZE LUBE sparingly on the new screws.  Talk to anyone who replaces Honda brakes and they will each have at least 1 horror story about the rotor screws.  Honda engineers need to have their n**ts squeezed for this simple goof that has tortured a generation of mechanics.

"Hi.Can you check someting for me, pease?What exactly is written in the spark plug -""Denso Japan"" or ""Assembled in USA with Japanese & US parts""?Thanks",Can't say for sure. I would go to www.centricparts.com and look at there ecatalog and check your aplication. Or if your on your home PC amazon should have drop down menus to pick year make and model. If all that jives its possible the picture doesn't match the item which sometimes happens.

what other hard wear besides the deflector is included i.e screws rubber bumper (to keep it from flexing like the oem one) ect,"i believed i paid for $80 something for a pair, and most likely the price you paid for is for one. But there are cheaper one out there cost $20 something but remember are paying for what you get. My bro is a mechanic and he suggest buy the one around $40 is good enough and i bought a set of centric, they work fine, and smooth also no much rusty after a car wash or in rainy day.

"Will it fit with a 35"" tire on the factory tire mount?","I've had one for a few years now.  I think I may have tried velcro, but in the end I decided that it generally stays put on its own.  If you're trying to put a large drink in the cupholder, it won't stay in the holder anyway."
Will this fit on my 1998 ML320?,"the design of carrier and weight of items in carrier, coins, cd's, etc , keep carrier secured to carpet."

Since gasoline is more volatile, I cannot see why it could not pump diesel fuel. Contact Airtex for their recommendation. They have a great support staff. When diagnosing the fuel pump in my 2003 Ford E450 RV, I needed to know the pin locations on the fuel pump connector. Wiring diagrams only go so far. Airtex was able to supply that information."

Is this include Lug Nuts/Bolts or Just the Wheel?,have not use it
Is this compatible with a toyota tacoma dx 4x4?,Not noisy at all. Once your engine is started you wont be able to hear it.

do these vent any funes or gas when charging? Can they be used indoors?,I do not have an 2012 Honda Odyssey but according to K&N; website the HP-1010 filter will fit your mini van. The filter will fit many different cars...  I use this same for my 2006 Acura TSX and 2006 Nissan Titan.
"Hi, can this Husky Liners Custom Fit Front and Second Seat Floor Liner Set for Select Ford F-150 Models (Black) fit on my 2014, Ford, F-150, STX?",not me.
I usually wear size Large. My Chest is 44inc and Waist is 33inc. Which Size should buy for a perfect fit?,I run these on my 99 GST Eclipse.  The parts finder on here has never let me down though so I'd order with confidence ;)
"So the lugs on the hubcaps are fake, and they can not be removed. Is that correct?","I would say that it would be the same part number. I used it for my '04 Accord and I think almost all Honda cars use the same oil filter. Regardless, I would recommend the K&N; over the Honda filter any time. Best of luck."
will this darken lighter colored leathers?,Go look it up on the K&N; site to double check.
Does this cover fit a 200GT with the large windscreen?,Used it on my Acura -ck with K&N; direct of U have doubts. I did..

Can this cover be installed with a bedliner in place?,"I would not go past recommended intervals. It is a good filter but remember, the filter is the only thing keeping your oil clean. That said, maybe 7,000 miles but that depends on your engine and the amount of dirt that gets sucked into the engine.."
Is this valve universal?  It doesn't state so in the description.,About 7500 miles for both Syn oil & filter
Can it be used on all types of vehicles. I have a Lexus CT.,"In my opinion K&N; makes the best filter out there. Your car's owner's manual will give you an unbelievably high interval but I'm not comfortable with this. Synthetic oil holds up better than dino (petroleum) oil and can go longer before breaking down. Some people will go up 12K miles between oil changes and then change the filter every other time, but I'm just not comfortable with this because oil is also a cleaner as well as a lube. The filter merely keeps the micro-grit out of it. I change my synthetic oil and filter together at 5K mile intervals on all of my cars, which is probably too often. But I figure this is cheap insurance. I buy my cars to keep as long as possible, so I take extra care of them. I hope this answers your question.

"how many weels with 86$, is it 4 pices ??","That depends on the car and the way it has been driven.  My Honda ""tells"" me when it wants fresh oil, typically around 10,000 miles.  This high quality filter makes me more comfortable waiting that long."
Is that price for 1 strut or 2? I thought the price was for 2 in a box until I went to check out and seen you doubled it up. You should state that on the page . I did not purchase this for that reason,"Safest answer is to change whenever U change the oil..if the oil change interval is 5 k..and U do a great deal of hwy driving, U might stretch to every other oil change,  but why, it's the cheapest  expense..use synthetic oil and always change at least once per year"
is this the one that goes on the right side of the tailgate at the bottom,I don't think there is any different interval. I always change it each time I change the oil.
Does this item need to be welded onto pipes? How is it installed?,"K&N; makes one of the best oil filters on the market. It all depends on what your driving habits are, as the Honda oil wear algorithm takes that into account and will indicate when it is nearing the oil's end-of-life. If you use a good synthetic oil and this filter, there's no reason you can't go 7,500-10,000 miles depending on your driving."

Will this cargo net fit a 2013 Acadia Denali?,"Moog's warranty on ball joints has always been if it ""fails due to a defect in materials or workmanship as long as the product is used normally and serviced and installed properly on your vehicle.""  So it would have to fail quickly and you would need to prove that it was defective and that it was installed professionally.  This has always been my understanding.  There are parts houses that will further back up the products they sell."

will this fit the back seat of a 2007 ford five hundred,"When i punch in that number for my F-250, its says they are the wrong lowers. Any thoughts, i cant seem to find them."
will this work with 2007 Honda Odyssey?,Ball joints are not adjustable. The adjustment is made in the linkages connected to the ball joints.
Also is the Granade threaded?,A front end man who does alignments is the best to ask. To my knowledge the ball joints have to be replaced due to excessive wear and play in the ball which does effect front end alignment. The rod ends are where the alignment occurs when the ball joints are not worn. I find the Moog ball joints to be superior to factory ball joints due to improved metalurgy. Ball joints are not adjustable.

The Berryman cleaner is mixed with the gas in the tank - about 1 oz. per tankful of gas.  But if the engine isn't firing at all then I'm not sure this additive will get it working again.  It will work best if the engine is running (even roughly) so that the cleaner can be drawn through the carburetor in order to clean the parts.  If the engine isn't running you might put the cleaner in the gas and try to get it into the carb by attempting to start the engine.  I would just let it sit for a few hours and then try starting again.  If that doesn't work then you may need to disassemble the carb and clean it or rebuild it.

Does it fit 2015 Forester 2.5?,"Well, I am not optimistic, but you can try it.  The gunk in your tank is only part of the problem.  Your carburator may be gummed up and fuel line may be clogged.  If this is a good mower, I would consider having a small engine mechanic take off your carb and tank, clean and soak, put back on, and do a tune-up.  Or you could do it yourself.  If you use an engine cleaner, you might buy one in a spray can with a straw so you can spray into gummed up nooks and crannies of carb or tank."
"Is there anything to rust at sea? Any springs, screws?","I've seen it work on worse (much worse!!)  Before you try it, drain the tank and rinse it with clean gas, then put it back on and you should be ready.  You probably ought to take out the spark plug and clean it, too, then while it's out, crank the engine enough to get the smell of fuel coming out the spark plug hole.  If it still won't fire, it's not the fuel's fault."
Where were these manufactured. I'm tired of cheap China-made copies.,This cleaner is made to break down gum and gunk from old gasoline and clean out your carb and system.  I see no reason why you could not spray on the carb  to clean but perhaps not the most economical cleaner to just remove dirt and grime from the exterior of the carb.  I don't see how it could hurt anything but would spray on let sit for a couple of minutes and rinse off with hose.  Strong stuff so do not get it on yourself especially when using water hose on it.
"B. Adrienne Oyler, I own a 2013 Focus ST, will this cover fit my car? Can you share the year/model of your Focus with me. Regards, Allen...","Yes, but you may find a carb cleaner already in a spray bottle to be easier and cheaper."
will the  rear flaps fit 2001 suburban with flared fender moldings?Doug,"Yes, I used it to clean out my Tecumseh 8hp snowblower carb.  Worked great!"
how would this item work with a bezel with a camera and a plug in the place of a lock?,"You can't ""spray on"".  It's bottle, to pour into fuel tank or soak small parts in.  A small carb of a a mower (dissembled) you probably can soak in a coffee can with this."
do i need to add any acid to this battery or is it redy to go when its received?,"I've been using it for 40 years or so.  If the problem is contamination, varnish or dirt, I've never seen it fail.  Hard to tell from the brief note you wrote just what's wrong, but it can't hurt!"
how do i prevent if from condensation inside lens or is it for some headlights?,I don't think this B-12 can help. You have to find out what cause the engine misfire. B-12 is help clean along the fuel line to fuel injector. I think may be your distributor is worse too.
does it fit any helmet?,I only used it on my snowblower carburetor.  It cleans out the gunk and will clean out your fuel line and injector.  I would give it a shot since it's a cheap tool to help with the diagnosis.   Be aware that it may be something else though.
will this fit the trunk too?,"Sorry but I do not know if true or not on this question.  I do know it cleaned a carburetor on a pressure washer that had been sitting for 5-6 years with old fuel and black gummed up carb.  Poured thru air cleaner (vertical carb) and in 10 minutes it cranked and runs like new.  I would never have believed if I had not seen it with my own eyes.  I feel sure if you put into your crankcase and run for 15 minutes it will clean out engine but would also suggest running a bottle thru your gas tank also and I think you will be amazed.  My old 2001 Nissan Pathfinder gained 3 GPM after one bottle thru gas tank.  These things I do know for sure.  I would suggest you ask Berryman directly and if they say it is so I am certain it will be so.  I am not from Missouri but I still have to be shown on stuff like this and I am a believer in Berryman B12.

Is it more of a matte black or shiny black ?,"According to the Autozone website (I usually check their site, then, buy from Amazon. Autozone wants $56 for this oxygen sensor), this is the upstream (before the catalytic converter) sensor for your Ranger but you would need a different one for the downstream sensor (after the catalytic converter).

Is there a left and right side bearing or just one bearing for both sides.,"Did you replace these because you had codes saying these were bad? If you had codes saying that all 3 oxygen sensors were bad then you probably replaced good sensors. Or did you replace them thinking they might fix your problem? If the later is the situation, then you need to get the trouble codes to see what's going on. If you have access to live data on your scan tool, all 3 oxygen sensors should have a voltage fluctuating up and down around 0.5 volts, meaning one moment you will see something like 0.8 volts and the next 0.3 volts and constantly fluctuating when the vehicle is at operating temperature. If they are fluctuating like i explained previously then they are doing what they are supposed to do. If you put in new sensors and they stay fixed like 0.8 (rich) or 0.2 volts (lean), then you have problems with fuel metering (injectors, fuel pressure regulator, temp sensor, misfire (bad coils),etc). Good luck!

If they are fluctuating like i explained previously then they are doing what they are supposed to do. If you put in new sensors and they stay fixed like 0.8 (rich) or 0.2 volts (lean), then you have problems with fuel metering (injectors, fuel pressure regulator, temp sensor, misfire (bad coils),etc). Good luck!

Has anyone tried to fit this on the 2014 Tacoma Double Cab Prerunner?,I had codes for oxygen seasors and misfires. I replaced them with new O2 sensors and all I have now is a misfire. My code reader tells me it's 3 cylinders that have a misfire.
are they 2250cfm each? or 1125cfm each?,I'm not Sure but there are 4 sensors maybe it isn't in the place where the effected sensor is double check the installation/wiring good luck !!!!!!!!!!!!
hi i need information regarding product weighs width and length measured,"Neighbor ... I hope that you are still reading.    The other guys mean well, but are off the mark.    This kit is the leveling system for use with the air bag system which is sold separately.    If you buy this kit and nothing else .... the answer to your question is zero.    The best thing for you to do is contact AirLift, tell the rep about your vehicle and what your goal is.    He'll tell you what to buy.    The rep is not a salesman.

"works on civic SI 2008 4Door?, Thanks.","About 30 pounds, ti the curb weight. Hauling weight capabilites are limited to your tire rating and hitch rating."
Does this come with the dash mount?,"The weight and hauling should remain the same.  The air bags help keep the truck level with a softer ride and more control.  I have a 12,000 lb 5th wheel that will drive the rear of the truck down 3 to 4 inches so it rides stiff.   With the bags it drives down the road even better than it did without the coach.  The load on the 5th wheel in the bed is about 2000lb.  Because of the bags I could hold more but I'm pretty maximum now."
can i use it to re-install the back window of a convertible to the fabric top. My window is slowly detaching itself from the top.,Your hauling weight will not increase. But you will find that your truck will handle and ride like it does when empty.
Will this sun visor fit a Hyundai Tucson 2006 Limited?,"Same odd thirty pounds for system: defined hitch limits and GVW for load limits.  My experience is improved stability and control umder full range of towing and cargo.  As is apporpriate at maxims something will fail, bend or break."
"Greetings! Need to buy AeroBlade for my 2013 Rav-4. Can you tell me which size would fit (i.e. Small, Medium, or Large). Thanks in advance.",Yes should work with any of them.
I have a camel leather bag that has a distinctive urine-like smell. Will this product actually seal the smell in?,Yes it will work with any of the air spring kits.
What brand are the tires?,"It will work as they both use the 1/4"" OD air tube. The smart air mounts to the frame and the axle and maintains correct ride height, keeping the headlights at the correct place. The smart air systems work automatically and is very good. I pull a 34' 5th wheel and it really works well and smooth's The ride a lot."
"Hello. To purchase a pedal device connected, what should I do?",Yea! All the air fittings are the same so you can use what ever brand bags you want.
Will this fit the boxer engine on a 2014 Subaru BRZ?,Yes it does
does it include rod clips,Air Lift is working fine with my Firestone Air Helper kit #2409. Don't see why it would not work with any kit that has same size tubing...
this Price is for 4 Wheel covers rigth???,"No. It uses the height of the suspension, and keeps it the height you set it. The angle of the vehicle doesn't matter. Just the load above the rear axle. Distance between the axle and the frame."
I have the LG refrigerator LFX31975ST is that the same air filter as the 945ST model?,"No it will not, it only changes when you increase or decrease the load."
Do these have a steady on mode so the white version can also be used for backup lights?,"No! Altitude will have an effect on the air pressure, but going up or down an incline will not. The unit should be able to maintain a constant pressure."
Will these fit the 2014 Patriot?,it will not unless there is weight shift on the back of the vehicle
"I purchased this as it said it was for the Jeep JK Wrangler, but the package arrived and said it was only for 2011-2013 JK.",The system sences the rear bumper height so if it senses the rear bumper is low it will adjust the height whether it's going uphill or downhill or on a flat road.
What size is the panel in inches?,"I found a fuse under the hood that was controlled by the ignition switch and I tapped off of it with a fuse stab all my wiring i left under the hood because i could not find a fuse in the cab that was controlled by the switch. the yellow wire is wired directly to the battery, also make sure you leave the black ground wire un hooked under the hood"
Does it fit in my Yamaha Vstar 250?,You can get power for the main fused wire for the compressor directly from the positive post of the battery. For the other wire that turns the system on only when the key is on you must use a light probe and find a wire that is on only with the key.  otherwise the compressor can run when it is parked and the height changes like you step up on the bumper. I also have a cab mounted gauge and kneel valve.
"Hi, is it  possible to fit this to RHD - 08 STI? Don't mind if it requires little mods that can't be seen.",Check your vehicles wiring diagram. You should be able to tie into the keyed power line in your hitch electrical connection. I recommend finding a junk yard and purchasing the male and female ends of the electrical union joint closest to your hitch so you do.  Not have to cut into your electrical harness.
Are they DOT approved?,Run wire harness up into the engine compartment on fuse box side and put spade electrical in with a key controlled fuse as in my case was the cigarette lighter that is off with key but any fuse that is controlled by the key is good. I to didnot want it in the cab
DOES IT COME WITH ADAPTER FOR BIKE TIRES?,"I have a 2012 GMC and I mounted mine on a cross member midway under the truck and I have had no issues with it. One thing I did learn is on the wiring harness there is a black wire that says it needs hooked up to a ground, this is not needed if you hook it up then the relay switch will stay open and the bags will not pump up & the air will just be released"
Does it come with installation kit?? Thanks! Ryan,I have a 2009 Chevrolet Silverado HD 2500. I was able to mount next to driver's side passenger door up by frame rail.
"How does this connect to the 2003 lancer oz rally,  What tools are needed and is the wire visible?  Where does it connect on the car?",I installed everything but the ride sensor behind the rear seat. Drilled a one inch hole through the floor in the cab corners for sensor wires and air lines.  One inch wire covering was fit on the holes to protect the lines and wires.  The occasional noise of the compressor running lets me know the system is working.
what year will this filt?,This thing is non returnable I wouldn't buy it
what size pipe do it flare and do it flare steel,"There are several places under the truck, just look for a space to fit it in.  You want to make sure that going over trails of rough roads it doesn't get hit by something in the truck.  I haven't put one on the ford.  I had one put on a 07 Dodge."
Will it fit a 2014 Scion FR-S?,"for lack of any place better, I mounted the compressor on the outside of the frame rail. It is advisable the put a rubber hose on the intake and route the filter in a clean place. I hope you like your super duty as much as I like mine. The air bags made a extraordinary difference pulling a 5th wheel trailer. Much smoother."
I have a 2009 F-150 5.4 king ranch is this plug & play or do I have to cut into harrness.,I meant in mind over the rear axle on the framework
will this adapter fit 2013 subaru wrx?,I bought an ammo box from the local farm store and mounted it inside it in the back of my bed where it is out of the elements. Works great!
"Does this work with DASH android app connected to foreign cars, such as Kia and Nissan?",I prefer to mount that kinda stuff in my truck box personally
will this fit a 2008 Toyota sienna 7 passenger?,"Screw type male end both sides to fit regulator. And yes only one In package. Can get it cheaper on eBay as a new item. Would not recommend buying it here, I too was robbed by thinking I got all 3 fittings."
"Has anyone tried essential oil blends in these bottles? I usually use glass, but these would be so much better if the oils don't dissolve the bottle.",They screw in.  The O ring comes with it. There is only one in the package.
how do you tie down,One side is male with an o-ring seal. The other is male AN. There shouldn't be any issues with leaking. Only one comes with each order.
would these lights work on a harley? would the motor be to hot for the lights?,These are male 2 male an fittings for the fuel pressure regulator from aeromotive... And no the are not included in the fpr package = you need to get a quantity of 3 ... Vs what the picture shows one order gets you one fitting ... Many have complained about this but no action has been taken ... I have them installed and they work great ... No leaks of any type
how do you plug it in?,Only one
these lights don't work I bought them awhile back and now after finally trying them and finding they don't work I am not able to send them back,"Looks like that is a representative picture of a  -6, a -8, and. -10 fitting. The part # is for a single -6"
Does this fit the V6 3.8 L motor?,Just one.
quality in long term,"No, its one each"
how many inches can you add by putting these on,Absolutely not you only get one.  Giant ripoff
"What is the overall height on this tire?TWO TRAILER TIRES & RIMS 4.80-12 480-12 4.80 X 12 12"" LRB 4LUG WHEEL WHITE SPOKE","no. this item is 1 of them only. if you need 3, for example, you must order 3 units"
"Installed, but works when IT wants to. Had a friend install it and tested it with DVD and USB drive. Seems to work only some of the time. Help!","Hi, these are the fronts.  The fronts have the sensors.Thanks,Good Better Best Auto Parts Inc.877-805-8686"
is bulb replaceable?,Just front. The four pads are for inside and outside of front left and front right brakes.
Will this fit a 1989 Honda Civic Si Hatch?,Front
how many pcs are there in a pack?,This is just for the front. You'll need to look up the part number for the rear.
Can you Send this item to Brazil by Fedex ? And How Munch to send for Zep Code: 69036790 / Stat. - Amazonas / City - Manaus ???,I have them on my passat 1.8t . So far excellent. Also have similar on my z3. No brother have similar on odyssey. So far no issues
"Hey, does it fit Honda Accord Lx Sedan 2014? Honda's all season floor mat for 2013 fits 2014 version. Does this one work the same?",Very pleased with these brakes on my a4
Will this fit a 2007 Camry?,"Low dust, great grip.Great pads, very happy with it."
Does this work on tile/vinyl floors as well?,"Have them on my 2001 A4 1.8TQ. Good pads, very little brake dust."
How about 2005 toyota corolla LE?,"no haven't had any complaints. Did you get the rotor resurfaced, and is the not worped"
do you have the lug nut covers ofr a 2011 C70?,mine operated flawlessly.  I would check that your calipers were are fastened correctly and that the pads are the correct size.
Is a blank emergency key included with the remote..?,I had these installed on my 2005 VW Passat (manufactured in Germany) and now I also have a very loud and annoying CLUNK every time I apply the brakes.  I've seen this problem reported in other places on the web.  I don't think it's a rotor issue but an issue with the pad.  Has anyone tried to get Akebono to address the problem?
does this come with installation hardware?,Yes
Will this work on a 12VAC snow blower without at full wave rectifier?,"Yes, they are much better replacements than OEM. No issues whatsoever."
Will this fit a 2014 GMC Sierra 1500 Delali? If not please guide me too the set that will work?,"My mechanic said they did. I didn't install them, he did"
Can you turn off the lights on the charger?,Yes they do.
"does it go in behind the wheel or snap on? I have three that fit inside the wheel and that is what I need, it is for a 3/4 ton 1970 gmc pickup.",I would say no cause it's a different body style
would this kit fit nissan frontier 2004 automatic diesel 4wd,"Yes. I have the exact same car (mine is the wagon) and put a set on the front last month with new Meyle Platinum rotors, excellent combo! Good braking, low dust and completely silent."
Does this fit the 2013 LT coupe camaro model?,"Don't know for sure. I used it on my 2002 VW Passat 1.8T. Up to 2005, the whole car was looking same. So i assume it will fit. I still have that pad and tons of life left. Seems i will never have to replace it in the life of the car. Also my BMW Z3 have the same brand. Working good."

I used them on a 2007 ford fusion and they worked well.  You can rent them from auto stores but honestly I liked these better because of the retainer pins.  They will save you a ton of money in the end.  Since you are getting this I would also recommend replacing the bump stops and the bearings.  Yes struts have bearings in them.  The need to be able to rotate a little.  One side of mine was seized up.  Just remember you should replace things in pairs.  You should probably get an alignment once done.  Because of this and the price of the parts you might as well do all four wheels.For safety I highly recommend having someone else around to keep an eye on you from a distance.  This is the most dangerous repair you can do on a car.  It is not bad if you use common sense, but the results of failure can be, well....deadly.  Take your time and do it right.

Thanks. I want to buy 2 packs. If they are shipped by USPS how much would be the shipping?,"Mine was a 2000 Volvo XC. Trucks shouldn't make any diff though unless, your springs are longer than the length of the compressor. If so you may have to buy another length. The compressor is set up to not be at a 90 degree from the spring. Tap the clamps just after they get tight to be sure that they lay flat on the spring  where the threaded nut meets the ball. If not, a couple cranks later when tightening the nuts will want to slide to that location."
"this is eligible for amazon prime, is shipping free?","Well I imagine that if somebody took their head off with a strut spring they wouldn't be on amazon to write about it :-).  That said I have used it a few times on different vehicles and it seems to be good quality, I wouldn't hesitate to use it on an F150.  Just make sure to keep the threads lubbed!"

Will this fit an Acura TL for the year 2000,"It should work on any automotive strut as the basic design is pretty much the same on all vehicles with struts.  It simply compresses the spring from each side and holds the spring so you can unbolt the top of the strut plate to swap the springs to a new strut.  If you aren't comfortable with this, there are some companies that have complete strut replacements including springs all pre-assembled so its similar to swapping out a shock absorber.  Monroe has some depending on the vehicle."

i nid rear wiper for toyota 4 runner 2001 it is work or not? pliese give to me answer thenks,Possible. It depends on the spring. It would be better if it was sold in 3's. 2 clamps allows the spring to twist once you get the strut out. I would say if there are a lot of turns on the coil and if it does not have a lot of preload on the spring it would be easy. In my case there are only 3 turns on the spring and when not bolted to the strut the spring is about twice the height so there is a lot of preload on mine (05 altima) making it near impossible with just 2 compressors

Should the battery make any noise while being charged?  The one I just got makes bubbling/boiling sounds while charging.,"Mine were installed on a 1999 F250 SuperDuty, V10.  If the frame is the same there should be no problem. Ask  your FORD dealer about the frame, then go for it.They are working great but I also want to install taller overload spring bumpers to reduce sway."
Does this have any kind of security feature like a padlock device or anything to keep people from stealing it?,"I put a set on a 1996 F150. Worked nicely. Caution: If you have dual gas tanks look on the inside of the frame BEFORE drilling! There can be gas lines, brake lines, etc., hiding back there. The Ford frames haven't changed a lot in 20+ years so I would imagine these would fit. Again...Look before you drill. Also, DO NOT run these bags without some air in them! Five to ten PSI is good. And, secure the air line twice as much as you think it needs. The tail pipe gets hot enough to melt the plastic lines. And you're going to hate drilling a couple of the holes, unless you're ambidextrous. Assemble everything, SNUG the hardware down.....DO NOT tighten all the way first time around. Make sure it all fits and clears. Put wheels back on.....yes, they need to come off. Look very closely, make sure everything clears everything else under there. Then crank the hardware down. And torque it all good. These bags are great.....but not ""plug-n-play""!

I'm wondering if anyone has tried to remove the decals/labels?  They'd be exposed and look ugly on my 1980 BMW R100/T  motorcycle.,"Unknown. I installed them on a Ford F150. The install went fairly easy. The only 'bad thing' was a small note about looking at the inside of the frame for things like the brake lines. And they were. Be very cautious about the other things, such as fuel lines and wiring, etc., before drilling any holes. But, the air bags worked quite nicely."

However, if your leaf spring pack is about the same width as the kit, and frame mounting position is clear, you may be able to use it. Some fabrication and drilling may be required. If you haul larger loads you will love these bags. The other answers you recieved contain great info as well. Good luck"

"The size of this mirror is different in the ""Product Description"" and the ""Technical Details.""  Which one is correct?

how does it fasten on,I have used this tailgate seal on 2 different males of truck and yes the tailgate can close harder. But the seal does work very well. I would say its normal to experience what you have experienced.
will this fit the existing thetford toilet in my 2012 Jayco Pinnacle? thanks.,My Chevy Colorado had rather large gaps to begin with and with the tailgate seal installed it feels just a little firmer closing than without the seal. I set my bottom seal flush with the bottom of the bed with the tailgate off. After reinstalling the tailgate the seal is also flush with the tailgate. I had more difficulty with aligning the sides the way the Colorado bed is made.
"Is this toilet a ""direct replacement"" for a SeaLand ""Traveler""?","I installed on a 2008 Chev Silverado 1500. There is some additional resistance in the last few inches of closure, but no more than expected for an effective seal. If your tailgate has increased resistance throughout it's travel, you should investigate for binding resulting from improper installation."
Is the mounting kit included in the cost? Thanks in advance,"I experienced it being harder for the first few days only, I'm real pleased the amount of dust that no longer gets in. Silverado 1500"
"What is the difference between bondo 422, 420 and 431 repair kits?","I could see where that could happen on some vehicles but the more you close it, the more it will compress, making the tailgate easier to close. If that doesn't happen, then you might need a thinner seal."

is oil drain plug m14x1.25? if it is I need 30.,"My Silverado has a spray-on Rhinoliner, and the seal works fine. Unlike my Chevy, which has a very irregular surface where you need to attach the seal - the Dodge trucks that I've seen have a nice, flat surface perpendicular to the bed floor where the bottom of the tailgate ""meets"" the bed. Your spray-on liner is probably not applied there, you should have an ideal clean, flat surface for the seal's adhesive tape to adhere. The lower portion of the tailgate that meets the seal can have the spray-on liner - the seal will crush against it, and there shouldn't be any significant infiltration along that surface. You WILL have some infiltration at the corners - spray-on liner or not. I get a slight amount of dust, but no water. I do not drive dirt or gravel roads.

Show Less",you will probably not find suspension bumpers that are specific to your vehicle and it is probably not worthwhile to try and find them.  why?  because this type of part is very generic and you have to decide for yourself if you think they will work on your truck.  even though they are a different shape than the stock ones on my 99 gmc yukon they worked perfect.  these are the proper part for your suspension its simply a matter of finding a pair of inexpensive ones that fit and provide a solid bump stop.

Does the set include the front or is it just the back,"Probably not, but it will depend on whether your truck is lifted.  It does the job for me on my lift with a lowered Chevelle.  My Truck is not lifted and it got it up high enough to put some jack stands on the axle. With the truck I used a 6 X 6 block of wood to get it up high enough.."

will it work on 46 ford pos. ground as a boost pump-- will it have flow thru it when not powered,No
Will this fit a 2013 Tacoma Prerunner?,I would not recommend these for anything that can move such as a trailer.  This works best on a very stationary lift.  Otherwise it can easily flip out from under what it is holding with terrible consequences. I've seen that happen twice already with mine.  You'd think we would learn.  This is a powerful jack and works great when used very carefully and under the right circumstances.  Lifting a vehicle or trailer would be a very bad idea!!

Good morning I wonder if the pair comes? I mean the driver's side and passenger,"Well Travel Trailer scissor jacks and not meant to ""Lift"" the RV.  They are just to stabilize it.  This is a basic bottle jack with 6 ton capacity.  Technically it can lift 12,000 pounds.  If you want to lift corners of your TT for leveling you would need to use some kind of block from your frame to your jack.  You do NOT put a jack like this under your scissor jacks.  On a TT side to side leveling is done by using some form of blocking under the tire (I keep some short 1x6 boards on hand for this).  Front to back leveling is done with the front tongue jack.  Once you RV is level you then lower your scissor jack to stabilize it.

If you want to lift corners of your TT for leveling you would need to use some kind of block from your frame to your jack.  You do NOT put a jack like this under your scissor jacks.  On a TT side to side leveling is done by using some form of blocking under the tire (I keep some short 1x6 boards on hand for this).  Front to back leveling is done with the front tongue jack.  Once you RV is level you then lower your scissor jack to stabilize it.

"some reviews say it does NOT slide around in back of suv, some say it does. I have an '09 ford escape with a plastic cargo liner in back. Is this going to slide around on me or not? This is very important to me. I had a plastic milk crate for storage but it slid all around so I took it out. I need something to stay put but have not found anything I would trust. I don't want to waste money and be disapointed.

"Will it work on a crack that extends to the interior? (small ding, with a very small crack  - 1 cm - on the interior glass)",Yes you can store on side.  If it leaks there is something wrong with the product.
Will it fit a 1991 Honda CRX-SI?,"I would think so, but just in case, I would put it in a large freezer zip-lock bag.  Actually, I would do that anyway even if it was standing up."
Can these pins be used as the sole hood latch mechanism on a carbon fiber hood? I would retain the original emergency catch on the hood..,"It's rated at 6 ton and I doubt that your Xterra weighs more than 1 1/2 ton at best.  So if you had a way to get under it and lift all 4 wheels at once, this jack should handle it.  Not that anyone would want to do that.  I have an '85 Chevy 3/4 ton 4x4 and it lifts the whole front end with  no problem at all."
how wide is it?,"I have a 2005 Xterra.  It weighs 5,200 lbs.  That is under 3 tons and would you not be lifting the whole SUV at once.  Mine works great."
There are pictures of two different styles.  Which one is it?,The jack is 10 inches depressed. My answer would be no.
does it have a filter?,8.5in
Few pieces included in the kit....?,"It's probably not more than 9 or  10 inches.  I can't get out to measure it tonight, but it's smaller than it appears in the photo.  The ram depresses almost to the height of the cylinder."
will they fit a mustang GT 2006,About 11 inches tall.
will it work on 95 buick roadmaster lt1,Open the valve and push it down
Can I use it on small screws and knives??,"Provided weight is on the jack it will rest by turning the fluid knob counter -clockwise.  It will drop fast.  Pumping is only needed to raise the weight.  However if you are looking for a spring back based upon a button push without weight, its not designed that way."
What are the dimensions of the lights?,"It will go down pretty quick, but you have to push it back down, it won't go back to the original(zero) placement without pressure"
"will it work for only newly installed led blinkers, not brakes etc?","Don't quote me but off top of my head I'd say 8-10"" not very much I know and no carrying case just came in a cardboard box"
"What are the parts included in the box? Mine only has the hitch and the ball mount. No bolts, clips, or anything else. There was an empty box and bag.","No it does not come with  a carryng case the  with the piston all the way up is 6"" and with the extension is 9"" the jack is 8"" tall hope this answers your doubts"
Would these fit recaro seats too?,No plastic case and I'm not sure exactly how high it goes but would guess that fully extended the jack is close to 2ft tall
Is this a 210 unit,sorry can't help you. Bought it as a gift.
I'm rust proofing my 1947 Willys jeep frame.  Is there enough prep solution and paint to do the job?,Yes they come with the foam rubber bump stop.

I would like to know if the brush bristles are hard enough to be used to clean hard to reach places of my car. (ex. between center console and seats),One
Would this work as a truck bed liner?,"The price is for 1 (one), as are most of the strut accompanying parts.  Because I wanted to do a complete job, I found it helpful to go the KYB site to insure all the correct & necessary parts for the Front & Rear."
can you use this for filling ac systems,one
How is the Sway Control device attached to the tow vehicle?,Pair
Will an SZ343 work on a 2013 or 14 Jeep Compass?,"The boot is sized to the specific KYB strut/shock for the application. Many (most?) times there is a different strut for all four corners of your vehicle, and two corresponding boots that are different for the front and rear of the car. The factory application is likely to use a similar boot. If I were to replace my struts again, I might use an aftermarket, universal fit boot rather than the KYB part. Check the KYB website for your specific application and also for rebates. I found an unexpected $40 rebate after the fact.  Also, be careful when you search for deals using the KYB part numbers as many unscrupulous manufacturers or dealers use the KYB part numbers as to confuse you into buying their parts.  No biggy for boots, but a BIG deal for shocks/struts. Good luck!

will this fit for a 2002 mercedes benz c240?,"On the Subaru, the boot slid over the piston shaft to protect it from damage. You'll have to look at your original installation, just remember to use new boots."
will this fit my 2002 f250 ford 7.3 engine,rear
Do you recamend its use in no maintenes boat hubs,This is a strut boot / dust cover so it fits over the front strut. See this diagram for clarification: http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/automotive/detail-page/B005GY8WV4.PT01.jpg
do theses come in a set or do I have to order a second one seperate?,"On our Subaru, there were boots on both the front and rear. Use new boots, they are cheap, I found a torn boot on one of the originals. They are going to protect the shaft from dirt and damage."
Is their a warranty for the product??,"welll   if  you  do not  use it--- dust, oil,  water , will render  your strut  useless in  about  1  year  or less  ,,    for  $$$$$  real    keep  shopping around   kyb  quality is  good  for strut boots  so  is  much cheaper  standard auto other brand names"
"Will this fit on a 2008 Tundra , auto transmission?",Yeah you need them with out um you'll blow the struts in no time because they'll be open to the dirt this scratching the rod enough to blow the seals
Are the gauges in fahrenheit?,"My 1997 & 2000 Ford Taurus (17 & 14 years respectively) utilize plastic strut boots/bellows. I recently replaced the entire quickstrut assemblies because the shocks were dead, however the plastic was still in good shape. The OEM's use plastic/polymer because it will not deteriorate like rubber. My 2005 Dodge Magnum (9 years) also uses plastic boots. I think all of these easily validate plastic boots as a quality material.  Installation method, then compression and tension extremes, such as off road use, will play a part in longevity regardless of material type."
how many inches high are these,plastic
will this fit my 1969 ss 396 chevy chevelle,plastic type material. should last longer than rubber.

"Is the pin hole size 1/2"" or 5/8""?",These were supposed to be for the rear on my 2002 civic ex sedan..... Although I have no idea how the would have ever fit.... The rear strut mount has the dust boot incorporated into it ( it's all one metal piece that protects the shaft of the strut!  I ended up not using them and just went with the stock setup.  The SB103's worked like a champ on the fronts though!!
"I assume since it can be used on a swimming pool, that outside temperature in the winter does not affect it.? I live in Rhode Island.","If you have a computer, just go to KYB.com and search the catalog. It fits front and rear depending on the model and year of your car. I put mine on the front struts of a 2000 Honda CRV, but probably didn't need it, because the CRV has ""metal"" boots which will last much longer than the plastic ones. (Unless you live in the rust belt.) I didn't want to send them back, so I just used them. If I remember correctly, the OEM strut washer under the metal boot gets tossed. If used the KYB boot will sit too high on the strut rod, and the top nut will not have enough threads to grip."

Give me a phone number please?,"It whistles at a very low sound... it's not the main cause of whistling, whistles more with air filter upgrades, even with a k and n panel filter in your air box. The noise isn't loud, and it's not a major cause of whistling. Hopefully this helps"
are both catalytic converters included with the Y pipe?,"Yes, mine came with gaskets. Hope this helps."
Will this work with watchdog sump pump backup battery? Thanks.,"Yes, it comes with everything you need."
My j-hook does not have a square hole at the end to click.  How do I secure the wiper?   I installed it but it comes out when it moves around.,I installed it and a Spectre cold air intake kitat the same time and the combination made a noticeable difference in power and sound tone.

The documentation (that comes with the product) lists the Splash Guard models (there are four) that fit each vehicle.

Can this be installed on a 2004 Dodge high output engine...5.9 diesel?,"Correction!!!  I went out and measured.  The inside diameter is 2 5/8"" the outside diameter is 3"".  You will still need 7"" of straight pipe or the extension may extend beyond the back bumper."

Will these fit my 2011 BMW 528i series?,"If you can't get an answer from someone who tried this on your exact model, then you are going to need to do your own engineering.  Look to be sure you have several inches of straight pipe at the end of your exhaust.  Then be prepared to make small modifications to the brackets or buy slightly different length bolts and find the right combination to get it where you want it.  This unit will fit a lot of applications, if you can tinker with it.  An exact fit model will be expensive, though should bolt right on.  I have mine on a 07 Highlander 4 cyl.  That took tinkering."

Pad set means both front and back?,I would clean the rust first by using a wire brush or sandpaper then wipe the surface.  Then apply Plasti-Kote.  Let it dry as it turns black.  Then you can paint over it.  Sand prior to painting if desired.
Are these front or rear wheel bearing? Does these come with the abs sensor?,No - simply paint over it.  I used a primer and then top coat.
Is this jack corrosion resistant?,"You could sand it off and then treat it again, to be xtra sure.  But yeah once it turns black just paint over it."
is this for one seat or two,You could sand it down but then you're taking the coating back off. What I was covering didn't need to be smooth so I just primered and used a hammer-coat.
Is this compatible for Acura TL 2007?,We scuff we red scotch brite pad. Level with filler if finish is very important prime and paint.
my current power mirror is not heated that i know of.  i damaged mine and am looking to replace.  will i be able to use this one?,I am not sure ..depends on surface. I used it on underside of my truck rocker panel s and inside of door ridge where it isn't seen. I then painted right over it with spray bed liner paint.  It did stop the rust where it soaked in good. I like the results so far.

I plan to use it this weekend and I will let you know how it goes.
Question cancelled. Item deemed unsuitable for intended purpose.,It really does work. I used for my iron staircase that is outside and all the rusty disappeared even without paint. I really love this product. I use it now on any item that is rusty.
will these fit a 2002 Camry,"Hey Fred, as I mentioned in my review I only recently used the product for the first time. It generally takes a while for  painted-over rust to start bleeding through, so I cannot vouch for the permanency of the application.  But the job turned out beautifully, and it was a good bet for me, because installing a new door would have been many times the cost of the Plasti-Kote. There are a few users who have uploaded to YouTube their Plasti-Kote jobs; perhaps you could reference one of them."
just ordered hitch today for my 1990 yj how is the install?I plan to put the bumperettes on as well,"Worked for me and i didn't even sand. Just scraped of the rust scales with a wood chisel, brushed it on let it dry, and painted over. Hoping my swamp cooler will go one more summer. 2 month along no rust showed up yet. Buy u won't be sorry."
Can you tell me what kind of hardware is required? I don't have the original or Best stop hardware. I believe the original softtop is a Rampage brand.,yes it work pretty good. You need to brush it before using but you don't have to put too much work in to it.
is this a matte finish? i'm not looking for glossy,You'll have to paint over that spot. Because plastic who turns everything black
Will this install over a non-OEM bumper?,It won't cause any paint damage.
Do you have to do any drilling? if so just to mount the actual filter?,"The directions on bottle say to ""avoid painted surfaces.""  However I did a bit of overlapping on my job onto a painted surface and no harm seemed to be done. The stuff is painted on with a brush, so Iused an small artist type brush for close areas.  I did the job last April and the door still looks like new. I suggest you try a small amount on to a painted surface you don't care much about to see for yourself."
What rating does this switch carry for inductive loads?,as said before... will turn whatever.. Black. Do not believe it will hurt it at all.
Does product fit the 1985 BWM 325e?,No it doesn't harm paint.
how many cup holders are there?,"Yes, this is what we use it for in our shop! It stops rust from spreading any further and can be painted, an alternative to cutting out."
Are these vinyl cling type decals?,Absolutely.  I believe it's used for that purpose more than any other.
"I already have the shocks, and am keeping facotry springs, just needed to be sure I did not need longer than stock to run this lift kit, confirmation?","This worked great on my car bumper.  I removed as much of the rust that I could with wire brush and sand paper.  Cleaned off the remaining rust dust with tack cloth.  Used the Plasti-Kote, waited for it to dry and then used primer, paint and clear coat.  No rust has yet appeared.  I am very pleased."
Does it come with a power cord?,"Although it's not required, it's highly recommended that users apply 2 coats of a good quality, oil-based paint over the rust converter; especially if the surface is exposed to outdoor elements."
Is it USA Made?,"I would not say it's ""necessary"" but it's recommended on the bottle. If it's a an item, you'd want to keep for awhile (such as my car), I would definitely buy the recommended primer and follow the instructions. I've used just the Plasti-Kote on my windshield wiper arm rather than Plasti-Kote + primer, and thus far, it's okay. BUT, it's Chicago in the summertime right now so there's relatively little chance for the arm to rust again. The true test will be what happens in the winter."
do people use these on their airplane.,"Technically, I think you would be OK. This stuff not only converts the rust to an inert material, but it produces a thick, hard black coating on the 'non-rusty' parts. However, if the goal is to preserve the metal as long as possible, I would still prime and paint with a high quality enamel paint. I am using ift to refurbish an old BBQ and it is working very well."
I have  2008 tundra double cab will this fit?,"I'm compulsive, so I would probably at least sand the edges of the paint.  When I used the product, I followed the directions on the can faithfully, and so far the stuff seems amazing. It turned the rust black and I could not tell that rust had been there before."

how long is the power cord?,"It comes with 3 or 4 different plastic inserts that are not threaded. They are just plastic cylinders that are 8mm in diameter to like 12mm in diameter. This product is not worth the money in my opinion. Bc it is tight at first then loosens over time and when you keep tightening it it eventually will strip out the threads and just be loose never tightening again. Anyways if you searched ""2007 Pontiac solstice shift knob"" (or something like that) and this popped up in the selection then yes it will as long as it's a standard."

Obviously, electrical systems vary, sometimes dramatically, from one vehicle to another, so I'm assuming that the instructions that came with my POD would be different from, say, your Tundra. You might be able to get wiring info from the vehicle manufacturer or from Reese (They are a product of Cequent Performance Products - http://www.reeseprod.com/content/contactus.aspx). They were very helpful when I contacted them with a question. Once you obtain the wire coloring schematic, installation should be fairly easy.

You probably could order and adapter plug for the Tundra but running the wires yourself will save money. The  Hopkins 47185 Multi-Tow Adapter $20.27 has all the wire connections for the rear already prewired. You will need to run 2 12 guage wires from the connector in the rear, one to the controler (Blue) for the Brakes and one to the battery for 12 Volt power to connector if you think you need it back there (RED). Also a 12 guage wire from the battery to the controler (RED). The controler has 4 wires coming from it. 12V Power (RED), Ground (WHITE), Brake wire (BLUE) and a wire (BLACK) that connects under the dash to the stoplite switch at the brake pedal. The ground wire may be long enough, but the rest need to be extended. Use the proper guage wires. The multi tow adapter has all the wires you need to hook up the Tail and Right and Left turn signals, but they to are in a 4 pin plug that is of no use. Cut it off and extend the wires you need to the tail lights. You will need Hopkins 48615 Mounting Bracket $4.98 also.

Can this be used to empty a hot tub and is it battery operated? Problem solved. Thanks for all the answers!,"No. Should be pre-set. However, you really should check gap on all plugs you install into an engine. It is good practice, and you can note it as a reference for performance. You may wish to vary the gap based on your requirements for performance, power of engine, and the load you place on it. If you don't know, or have a stock engine, just make sure all the gaps are the same. Use the factory recommend gap, which as we said, should be pre-set.  Don't reset it unless you happen to hit the head when installing, requiring a re-check."
What bulb size do these use?,"It is generally understood that iridium plugs can very easily be damaged, even by just checking the gap.

You need a large micron pre filter ( 30 micron is great) and a 10 to 20 micron between pump and rail. Keep the inlet side 3/8 to keep from restricting pump.

are the hand grips comfortable?,"It would be fine to store this in a cold car, as long as you keep it fully charged. It may self-discharge a little faster in cold weather, so check the charge once a week. Inside it is an Advanced Glass Mat (AGM) lead-acid battery, like an Optima battery."

Clore JNC300XL 'Jump-N-Carry' 900 Peak Amp Ultraportable 12-Volt Jump Starter with Light.  I know it is more expensive but it lasts longer and it's smaller.

Is this plastic or is this a steel/wire mesh,"mA=milliamp. Yes, as long as the connector is the right polarity and size. More mA is fine, not enough is a problem. You should be able to get the original adapter from Black & Decker: 1-800-618-5178"

The bushing corresponds to the upper or lower arm?,Not a slow charger. It is a portable booster and works very well.
How bright is the reverse LEDs? is it brighter than stock reverse lights?,I could figure out how to change it.
Can you charge this unit using your car lighter?,This unit does not charge batteries. It is a 'jump-starter' that you connect to a weak battery to assist that weak battery in starting a car. It's like having a second battery with 'jumper cables.'
Do you have a set that will fit a 2012 chevy colorado?,I had no luck when I tried it.

I got a RCA AH3 AC Power Supply Charger Adapter from Radio Shack. It has settings from from 1.5 V to 12V and has 6 plug adapters. You can charge everything.
do these seat belts include the floor mounts and everything to install?,"Radio Shack or most other stores/websites that have a good electronics section. The AC adapter that came with mine doesn't even say Black and Decker on it. I used a label-maker to label it ""booster"". The input is 120 volt, 60Hz AC of course, the output is 12 volts, 500mA, center pin positive. It's vital that you the polarity (center pin positive) and amperage (500 mA or more) is correct on the power adapter, or damage could occur! I measured it with a micrometer, the outer diameter of the plug is 5.5mm, the inner diameter is 2.5mm. So, the Radioshack catalog #273-357 paired with the Adaptaplug N (catalog #273-345) should work. With the adaptaplug, you flip the tip around to change polarity.

When batteries are charging, they produce a tiny amount of hydrogen gas, which is explosive. Modern batteries are low/no maintenance however, and vent very little hydrogen, so there isn't much risk, unless you are charging for hours. If you use a charger, leave the hood fully open to vent gas, and choose the slowest charging speed that works for the situation. Engines generally have lifting hooks attached to them. If this hook is not painted, and the battery terminals are clean this is usually a good place to attach to. Otherwise, look for a cable going from the negative battery post to the frame/engine.

Does this rack fit on a 4-dr 2005 Toyota Camry?,"i didn't see that you had to dilute this stuff so i used it right out of the bottel, didn't do jack for what i wanted it to do. gave it to the wife for grease spots didn't do any good there either. won't buy anymore of this dkljgod."
What are the dimensions of this item?,It doesn't work.  Don't bother.
What is the power consumption  and how may lumens do they put out?,"didn't try it on that, just on cement for transmission fluid and it didn't work..."
I am comparing this product against the Chemical Guys Instawax and Carnuba.  Has anyone compared and what would you recommend?,I DON'T KNOW! But when i need a gentle but effective degreaser i now use DAWN DISH SOAP it's gentle enough for oil spill damaged waterfowl it probably won't damage wood and it cuts grease on dishes really well
is this the drivers or passengers side,I do think a diluted mix would work.   It is really powerful stuff.   I would follow directions on bottle and try a Small corner first but I think it would work
I have a 17 year old washing machine.  The trunnion is rusted solid to the shaft.  Will this product penetrate severely rusted parts?,I ve never tried but if it has a greasy consistency I would assume it would.  Truly amazing stuff and good to have around in case of emergency
r these hi beam & low beam combined?,I only used it for cleaning oil off the driveway. But the way it worked I feel it may remove just about anything you spray it on. Might be worth a try.
how many mount kit is in this order i saw a installation video on youtube that says that we need 6 of them?,Yes
how thick is it?,Yes
Will this product set off the check engine light?,Yes
what are the demensions,"No, I have not. I used it for concrete, and it did not work. My best option to date has been vinegar. It will take grease out of almost anything."
Will this  fit the new 500 Fiat ?,you have to use  diluted solution immediately to get oil or stain out
Tire Does the tire come with the rim as in the photo?,"HI --I use it for everything.--it is the best all-around cleaner for everything I can find-.   Some people dilute the liquid for laundry---I don't,  I spray right on the stain--or stains.  No need to leave it on for a bit-like oxy .  You will find your niche. but it is a GREAT  cleaner for everything---J"
Is this a 4 ply tire,"I have never used it for this purpose, but upon re-reading the bottle I would presume it would be like using any presoak treatment.  I have used for removing dirt and great from metal, plastic, etc. and it's great.  Hope this helps!"
dimensions,I'm not guaranteeing anything..but I did get really old stains off...Not completely but way better than before...
"2028C would not fit my 275-60-20 tires,  what is the next size larger chain??",Not sure on some that old. But it works well and I think it is worth the try. Mine was on cement so asphalt could be a problem.
what size is this helmet,"Not sure. I used it on concrete, and it did not work to remove grease stains, so I went with good ole vinegar. It ate the grease right off, and is safe for my family."
Does this fit the right hand driver Australia built VW Passat Wagon MY13.5?,I used it on my 95 Honda civic engine.  It broke up the grime and grease and didn't harm anything.  It worked pretty good.
will  this fit a wagon,"Works great on our boat, everything in my food cart. Stuff is amazing. I think give it a try. If it turns out not right for boat engine its got 1000 other uses. I just cleaned a horrid grease caked vernt hood with it in minutes"
will tow ready 118491 t-one work on a 2013 honda pilot without any extra wiring,Yes
Do these struts work on a 1999 Toyota Camry LE (4cylinder engine)?,"Yes, 1/2"" all three."
"What size are the two balls, 1 7/8","The female port is called the common port and is labelled with a ""C"".  If your intended use is to divert from one port to either of the other two, the intended application, then you must use the female as the inlet.  However, the valve could be used in a reverse application where both male ports are used as inlets, and the female becomes the outlet. For example one male could be connected to a cold water supply, and the other male could be connected to a hot water supply.  Handle in one position sends cold to the female port, while in the other position it sends hot.  It would not be a good mixer valve since one male is nearly closed before the other starts to open.  The common port is never closed.  Each of the male ports are alternately closed depending on handle position.

Is it possible to talk without press the PTT? like a headset with VOX?,Female in. Male out.
how does it fit on the lifts that have a center post?,yellow brass body. We just closed our trailer for season  and it was the easiest ever with these valves
Does it come with all 4 pieces?,"I would say it's brass. Or brass like. What it really is, I am not sure."
Is the decal too large to fit on the lid of my 3ds (not xl)?,I would say Yellow Brass.
How do you install this item?,"OD of the male parts is approximately 0.80 in. Female part is 1 in on the ""square"" side and 1.12 in on the chamfer (but I don't think you care about those)."
Does it provide Transmission fluid temperature reading?,i installed it last winter. if my memory is corect its half inch pipe thread. on the female end as well as both male ends.
Will these fit a BMW 335i Coupe 2007?,sorry i cant help you with what the internal specks are. but it works great to by pass the hot water tank in my camper.
Was this bumper glossy black or matte black? Can't tell from pic. Is it textured? Thanks,"I'm guessing brass.  Just an open close valve, doesn't seem complicated to me."
"what size should I get for 10 yr old daughter, her head measures 22""?",It could be used as a mixing valve but I am not sure you will get full flow.
can I install this windshield with my existing quick removable brackets to a HD 2002 Dyna Low Rider ?,"No one to either other one but not both at same time. a simple ""T"" would do what you want"
Is this one headlight or a pair?,"No, that would just be a T fitting.  A bypass valve is to allow the selection of which outlet pipe the input flows to."
will these fit the 2000 lancer model?,"no, ball valve bypass.only 1 at a time"
Are these for trucks that are 4 by 4?,"The purpose is to flow each male separately to female depending on valve handle position.  If you are wanting to use it as a manual mixing valve then half way on the handle will cause both males to flow to the female at the same time, but the flow rate from either male is much reduced.  The combined flow may be significantly less than either one by itself.  One male is not quite shut off before the other opens."
Do they fit and are they brighter than oem on 2005 Honda Accord?,"It's one or the other. You could move it just partly open to get some water from both, but then both inlets would then be very restricted."

Does this fit a 2013 rogue?,It will only drain one way at a time. You must manually turn to drain whichever line you want
Will this fit on a 2014 Civic Si Coupe?,"Hi Deborah,  The rest of the RV plumbing will work just as before switching to bypass.  You will need to drain the water tank after making sure that you have turned off your electrical element by turning off the switch or tripping the Water Heater circuit breaker. The low point drains should work just as before and you need to open your hot and cold valves on all of your faucets until all the water has drained out of the low point drains.  Once the water is all out of the low point drains and your water heater. close the low point drains, close all the faucets, and charge the system with RV antifreeze opening one faucet (including the commode) at a time until you see the pink  liquid then close the valve.  Dump the excess antifreeze into each sink and the toilet after all the outlets of the sinks, outside shower, inside shower have been charged with antifreeze.  Use the RV's water pump inlet to suck the antifreeze from the container to charge the lines.  Most RV's will need three gallons or less.

Can this fit into my 2004 range rover please,"Hi, the description just says ""intermotor horn"" we are not professionals so we do not know where it would go.  But I would think it replaces your actual horn for the sound. Thank you!"
we bought a wrench cap but it did not FIT in order for this to be REMOVED!!!!!! what Wrench tool are you using to REMOVE this filter??,I was able to find this information online.  You may want to double-check with either your mechanic or your dealer.The horn fuse and the horn relay are in the left front under hood fuse/relay box.This is a location diagram and the inside of the box. Sorry about the size of the diagrams. They don't allow us much space here. The fuse and relay should be marked in the fuse box lid.Here is a wiring diagram just in case you need it.
wILL THIS FIT ON THE REAR TIRE OF MY 2013 NINJA 636?,"I took a small flathead screwdriver and carefully pried the socket from the wiring clip. It popped right out, and the new one pushed on easily. You can see how it matches up. Just be careful to do it gently so you don't break it off. Mine was a perfect fit, so you shouldn't have any problem."
can it be used on a fiberglass tub/shower?,"It was easy. just take the bulb out then there are 2 plastic clips holding the socket to the wiring. Unplut the old socket, plug the new one in, replace the bulb."
Will I need 2 purchase any additional small parts that would work with this kit. Or parts that usually go bad on the suspension,There is no trick. Just remove the clip from the wiring and unplug and plug in the new one.I was able to do it with my fingers only. You could use a flat had to assist with the clip
Will it fit 2009 TL with stock wheels?,long needle nose pliers  turn  'clockwise if  I remember right'
"do all 3 of the pins come with this, including the top one and also the pin end connectors",I did it the same way the others did. I just used my fingers. It was pretty easy to remove.
Will this work on a 2001 Xterra?,there is usually a small plastic tab on the wire coming from the car that locks into the new socket. you have to gently pry it back with a screw driver. also it you live in the north and it is cold out be very gentle. they can break off rather easily. also you should use a small amount of dy-electric grease between the bulb and the socket to prevent an electrical arc. which is likely why it burned out in the first place.
iam 5.6 what is the diferents between the krome werks model handlebas 300042 and 300043 will they both fit my 07 roadking with stock cables,"Without knowing for sure, I would most likely answer yes.I would think that this socket was used in several year models."
Does this fit on any steering wheel? I'm a truck driver.  Will this fit on a big steering wheel?,"According to the Amazon part checker it does. Click on the item, top of the screen says make sure it fits, select year and make. It says it does."
Will it fit the 2009 hybrid highlander?,i did a parts search for your 2000 buick regal ls. it shows that it will fit your car. only takes a minute to replace.
Fit 14 Chevy Cruze?,You would need to check which one your car uses specifically. This car is on the list for this socket: 2000 BUICK REGAL V6-3800 3.8L
"hi there  i  would  like to buy this tires , but  not sure  if they will fit  my  truck?",yes it does fit also fits 98 buick century custom
Can this device be programmed by a locksmith,According to information that I found on eBay regarding this exact product .. YES  ..  it should fit.  If you haven't ordered it already you can research it online to confirm further.  Hope this helps you.
Will it work for a 2012 Hyundai Accent?,"This should not be used for automotive tires. It's designed for motorcycle, bicycle tires and is designed small because motorcycles dont have much room.  Your car should not be so crowded that you need a pump this small.  For another 20$ at sams club you can get a self contained battery jump box, pump, light system that is simply impractical for motorcycles."
Would this fit on the 2013 model?,"i use it for my motorcycle tires.  just takes a couple of minutes! works get, always have one with me!"
"what is the class, the size  & the part number of Ball Mount and Draw Bar ? i prefer to buy it from amazon",I take it my car in case of emergency

Will my 5 inch gps fit in the big widow pocket?,"No, but it does come with a separate pressure gauge."

will these fit 2013 Harley dyna switchback?,nothing you have to carry a pressure tester for the air pressure in the tire no big deal
"Does this bulb have a swivel base? (i.e. once the base is plugged into the socket, can the LED still rotate 360-degrees, independently of the base?)",No. Even if it did most inflators are very inaccurate. No substitute for a good tire gauge. This inflator is bottom of the barrel junk.
does it come with a wiring harness and switch?,the CFM for this product is .850 CFM and sombody asked about the amps and it is 15 amps power rating.
does this blower have a plug attached to it?,I don't know what the spec is but it will trip a 10 amp circuit on a BMW motorcycle equipped with the Canbus. It will run for a few seconds and then kick off. I had to wire a plug to the battery for this and other accessories.
will it fit a 2007 ford mustang?,"This pump requires a 15 AMP circuit on your motorcycle.  It surges to 15amp when you turn it on, then drops back to 5amp.  If you plug it into a 5amp circuit, it will immediately blow the fuse."
Can this be used with a six speed manual,It runs on my Harley Canbus fine.   Straight out of the cigar lighter port.  Never had a problem airing tires on the many road trips I take.  Loaned it to my friend with a gold wing and it worked great.
Will these fit a 2012 Chevrolet Equinox?,Not exactry sure but rated at 15 amps on the box.

does this fit the 2015 honda Fit?,Absolutely. Best little compressor I have ever had and have had many.
"Won't this actually reduce the little space that is under the rear floor, by adding a layer of carpet? So I am  trading space for nonskid/padding?","It will work for bicycle tires.  I don't think it will work on anything without a Schrader valve like a car, motorcycle, or bicycle.  There is no needle adapter.   I always used a hand pump for atheLetic eq."
Will this product and it's software operate on an Apple Macbook Pro computer?,Absolutely 100%. I have had it for just about a year and I love it.
will these fit 2014 S500,Yes
"Will these fit in my Bull Bar? The bull bar states will accomodate 6"" lights but will not fit, per manufacturer.",Yes. The hose is too short. Not a good quality inflator.
Does the carrier come with the straps or do you have to buy them separately?,"I'm not sure about typical ATV storage. My ATV only has a narrow tube big enough for some wrenches and screw drivers. I find 4x4 models to have more storage options. Product Dimensions: 2.6 x 6.6 x 6.8 inches; 8 ounces. I Cary mine in this small backpack.....it's actually a camelbak with a couple of small pouches on it. I can't really think of anything comparable in size.

I want to a painless install on my 2007 f150 xlt will this work?,"There should be no reason it would not fit, all though I don't own a grizzly. I wired my own standard power outlet on my KLR650 and it's the same as a car cigarette lighter. The only power outlets I know of that need a special plug/adaptor are on BMWs."

Are these the 4 cabs or how many?,"No, it does not."
do i need front spools for my r6 when using these stand ?,no
how much tint will i need for  a 4 door 2007 chrysler sebring,Yes. The pump itself uses that type of connector so you will not need anything else.  Its a nice kit because it comes with an adaptor for a cigarette lighter and clip style connectors which would work directly to a battery. The pump is nice for maintaining tire pressure and I don't think it would be practical for flat tires because the unit needs to cool off for 25 minutes after 8 minutes of use. I'm going to get some CO2 cartridges in case I get a flat. I can then use this pump to dial in the proper pressure.
Does it work ok with iPhone 5,yes.  The only problem is the cord is only  a foot or two long so I got an extender that I keep with it.  I got it long enough to reach another bike or car if I needed it.

will they fit 97 gt convertible?,"yes however you may have to go to a hardware store to get a metric conversion fitting. I have used these on everything you can imagine by drilling and tapping a hole in the thermostat housing or any place you can get access to the radiator water flow. I have even used a piece of pipe the size that will fit in the radiator hose, drilling and tapping threads into the pipe and then cutting the hose and installing the pipe with two good hose clamps. Hope this helps."
Will this fit 2014 harley road king?,Yes as long as you have a manifold port for it to screw into.
Is there a strap to hold the bag in one place?,"The gauge is electronic and should work on any vehicle with a temperature sensor on the motor close to the intake, the power wires have to be hooked up properly but the temp sensing wire must go on the motor usually on the intake where coolant flows by it to get an accurate reading."
Will it fit the 2014 CRV EXl?,"Mine is red, never seen a purple one."
Does this product work for power mirrors?,"The needle is redish orange.    If looks are a concern, be forwarned the needle itself doesnt actually illuminate at night, like the needles on your car dash board typically do.  The light that shines through the numbers at night is the o ly thing that illuinates where the needle is, and for that reason I was dissatisfied with this guage and purchased a different one."

These are genuine Motorcraft dg511?,One eighth inch NPT
Does this slide fit a 2013 chevy silverado?,Yes You just need to hook the sensor to a part of your motor that gets hot so it can read the temperature. I hooked this up to the the intake manifold on a carbed cadillac 500 big block motor in a 76 sedan deville
Do I need to buy a charger for this battery if I currently have the blue peg perego battery and charger for the John Deere Gator?,"Unfortunately I can't.  I got the gage for a boat, have not installed it yet..."

Where is it made?,"As far as the owners manual and a tech at Equus told me, it will work for 1-12 cyl, including a V-10.  I bought it for my 3 cyl and have yet to install it, but according to them it's good to go.  Hope this helps."
Once cured is this safe around(direct or indirect contact) food?,It has a setting to change # of cylinders.  I actually installed it on my boat with a 4 cyl 2-stroke engine.  It comes with wiring to connect into a tach signal from the motor and alternate wiring to connect a coil pickup directly on the plug wiring.  This should give you flexibility to get it working.
is this antenna 24 inches or shorter,"Though my application is for an 8 cylinder, I do remember seeing in the instructions there are settings for 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 cylinder engines, which are reached by a ""cylinder setting"" button on the back of the tach."

Is the touch up paint like a brush or a ballpoint pen?,We used on a Honda.   Check manufacturer website

does it work on vw's,It needs a plug wire to connect onto. So depends if your coils mount directly on top of the plugs.
"i have a 2015 honda civic si coupe, will these fit my car? if not, which ones will?",I don't think so..contact equus
Where can I get a charger for this bat?,it comes with multiple color sleeves to change background color
"Is this the same as P215/55R17 93V? I see there is no ""P"" on this.",It has a led bulb inside that is clear/white the tach includes little rubbers that you can put over the led bulb to change its color. Colours included are red blue and green. if your not happy with the color I haven't tried but I'm sure you can get a piece of colored tissue paper and stuff that inside to change to any other color you want.
"Would it fit Mercedes ML 2003 with a u-hook? Amazon suggests yes, but I can see it from the picture.",This is a 3 3/8 hole mount there ia a ring on the back that screws on
will these seat covers fit in an lexus IS 300?,cut a 3 and 3 eights hole and it fits exact. you can have a little extra but not to much. I just did mine
I have a 97 Chevy Blazer. I show this will fit. Does it have Tilt Steering?,Yes the hole mount would be that diameter if you cut into your dash.  I have a round steering column.  I looped it onto the steering column with a hose clamp and tightened it down on it. It works great and does not move.  It has a slot the hose clamp can pass through if you decide to mount it the way I did.
Do you have one for the 2014 Tundra SR5?,"It can definitely be mounted flush in a hole, or on top of a surface using the bracket. I have it flush mounted but I don't remember exactly what size the hole is...... sorry.It comes with a big white nut that you screw on from the backside to hold it in the panel you mount it in."
will this fit a 2014 f150 4 door  5.5 bed,"I did mine a .3"" hole and then files edges a bit.  To make sure it was a snug fit so it won't. Wiggle loose in the future too big. Or just right of a hole.  Was my biggest fear."
Can this be used with bushwacker chevy OE bed caps,i am not sure....i have had a poor experience with this tach and the company that supplies it...i recommend that you not buy this tach.....mike
Is this Jack ANSI rated ?,It does have a spark plug wire clamp and you would have to hook up the positive and negative wires so it should work. I put one on my 91 Chevy and it works fine. I thought it was an easy hook up.
.,negative
What length of bungees cords do i need?,"Yes, in the instructions is how you do to set it in 1 cylinder engine"
Will this work for a 2002 Ford Taurus? It looks like the one we have.,"Yes, have it mounted on top of a dashmat on my plastic dash, setting up against the a-pillar. Very stable, doesn't move and doesn't get in the way of your view. Much too big for the steering column, would have blocked the view of the gauges. Great tach, very stable needle and no issues after 3 months. Love it!"
Does this comewith the headlight and bumper light?,Mine came with a big plastic nut that threads onto the back side. You can use it to mount it into a hole if you want to. The hole will have to be the same size as the body of the tack.These tachs work pretty well for the money.
"Is everything included in this item.  Power cords, helmet attachments and usual accessories",The mount is designed to both flat mount and will work in the column. I can't remember if there is a hole in the bracket to put a screw through. You may have to drill a hole. It is compatible with 4 to 8 cylinder engines.It comes with both spark plug and distributor pickups.
cnt tighten lock nuts when rail is on evn wth allen key and wrench on nut? cnt do bfr bc then brckts dont move to meet rail holes???,Yes.
Will this work if you are not on a race track.  I want to time bus driver rotation routes.,"Yes, but it may or may not come with a mounting ring that screws onto the back of the tach body. For that you need to purchase from Equus directly. It took over 3 mo. for them to send to me. Good luck!"
will this fit a 2011 sonata?,Yes it can real easy
"Does this come with the ball bearing, or do I have to buy that separate?",4-Jan
Does the water pump come with new threaded studs for the water pump pulley?,1/4 inch flare. Commonly found on central air conditioners.
Will it fit a 2012 GTI?,"1/4"". Commonly used with R12 and R22 systems(not limited to R12)."
Is this ok to use on the windshield or windows?,1/4 pipe flare
Will it fit a 2009 Subaru forester,R12 flare fitting.you can buy 134 adapters
Can you verify this will fit on my 2012 Polaris EV LSV model?,I'm not sure I have been using mine all winter here in Kentucky. Been in the teens while using the hoses. Only problems at that I seen the hoses wasn't as plyable.
Will these fit Suzuki quad racer 250?? Can u supply rims for tires??,"It can withstand temperatures ranging from -65 to +450 degrees F, A appliance Repair Co. of Michigan"
Will it fit for 2011 Hyundai Sonata?,R410A is a HFC refridgerant and has an ODP (ozone depletion potential) of zero and is not regulataed by the EPA.
well this header fit my civic 05 dx,"I would say 800 psi with a 4000 psi burst would be plenty good since head pressures on a 410a system shouldn't go above 550-600 psi without the compressor kicking out either with a high pressure switch and or the thermal protection devise. As for a official ruling from the epa, I am not sure. Since 410a isn't hazardous to the ozone, I wouldn't think the epa cares. But for safety reasons, never be too careful with a higher pressure rated hose set."
can you use it for snowthrower chuts and blades,I believe you are correct
do you guys have any other led lights similar to this ones but without the small bump on the sides? i need them for a 2013 Chevy Tahoe LS,"Information I have found on the web indicates that you are correct on this. I would also check that the manifold and gauges are certified for these pressures. I found manifolds that have R410A, R22 and R404A scales on the gauges. The high side on all the sets I found have scales to 800#, so for safety, be sure to buy the right hose. Also, if you are doing any work other than on your own unit, you could well be in violation of local/state codes if not using properly rated hoses."
Does this product fit too a leaf delivred in Norway whit a 6.6Kw charger installed inside the car ?,"If your question is, ""Will these hoses work on R134 Automotive A/C"", The answer is NO not without an adaptor set to make the connection to the car but the will fit to any standard 1/4"" flair Manifold Gauge set for all types of refrigerants and oils.  Hope this helps!"
"Have you left this unit plugged in for long periods of time - and if so, does it drain the battery of your car?",there are r12 flare fittings.  will not fit a 134a manifold.
is this abs or metal?,probably but the no burn schreider fittings failed under the higher pressure of 410A
i have a 2013 VW GTI will this fit,you would also need 134 snap fitting for 134a/c outlets  on auto if auto has been converted or was equip ed with 134 fittings.
Has anyone used these in the rain? How waterproof/weather resistant are they?,No they are not. But they are heavy duty
Do they come in a set of 4?,"No, they are not."
I am interested in these H11 for my 2010 Dodge Ram Sport. will these fit my vehicle I am curious as to the clearance behind the headlight assemble.,"I don't know about r22. but this won't work on r410a, you will need a adapter"
"I live in the Washington, DC area.  If I use #3 on a leather Kattee bag would I still need to use #1 to nourish the leather?  Or would #3 do both?","No, R410a hoses should be rated for 800 psi working pressure. These are only rated for 500 psi working pressure."
Will these Fit Scion Fr-s Monogram 2014?,They work excellent. I strongly recommend them to you I have been using them and I have not seen anything wrong with them.
"I have a Honda sh 150 with a 16"" Wheel , will this work?","Yes, it absolutely will."
Will this fit a 2009?,Do not know
Where is it made?,Yes they will.
l wii these bulbs fit myvehicle 05 ford f 150 LXT,yes
can this work with a Nikon d40 and 300,Yes they will.  I bought them for r22 but they will also work for r410a.
Can this be installed with the pocket locks if I have a bed liner?,Yes you can
Will these fit a 2002 Chevy 1500 truck?,"Based on goodmarts website it said its rated for R-410A, so it would be fine for both R-22 and R-410A"
Is this compatible with the 2014 Corvette Stingray? Can it be plugged into the port in the trunk?,"yes, I'm currently using it to run led fog lights as running lights."
"Is the $369.94 price on Amazon for a pair of mirrors, or only for one side?","I think you should be able to. Instead of connecting the wire for the headlights to the headlights, you would connect to your led lights. If you connect the rest of the wires as instructed, the leds would turn off when you turn on the park lights or the headlights. I though of doing it this way myself."
What is the distance that they will illuminate? Is there a flood and a spot light set on this light?,"I concur with the previous answers, I also used LED bulbs in the fog lights to use as DRL's."
Do you know if it fits to Mazda Demio 2001? Maybe you have part number or serial number?,I don't see why not.  It is just a wiring harness that allows your head lights to be on when you ignition is on and it is keyed to the parking light circuit so that when your parking lights and you headlights are on it doesn't direct any extra power to the headlights.  Some folks even run it t o the fog lights or aftermarket LED running lights with no problem.
will this fit in 2010 toyota 4 runner ?,"I had mine on a Scion xB, todays cars are so computerized, who knows? I would say yes but it's a guess. DRL's are required in Canada, it may be worth it to find out how it's done up north of the border. The van is probably set up for them just a matter of finding out how."
"What are the 7 pieces exactly? what do they include? Is it the 4 wheels, steering wheel, hood, and trunk? Please confirm. Also, what are the emblems made of? what material?","Without seeing the car my answer would be yes. The head light hookup is pretty much generic. The one thing that you have to locate, which varies with every model of car is a ignition key operated power source. With a little time and hot wire probe (meter or light) which you also need to find low beam wires, it is not hard. Probably an hour or two job depending on your skills. Good luck, Rich."
Anyone know if these goggles have UV protection?,If it is negative ground it should work
"Will these emblems fit on any other model from Kia? You offer a ""Soul"" pack but I have no need for 7 pieces. Thanks!",yes it can.
what differents will i notice between 60 or 50 hertzs when working this tool ?,"Yes, it should."
Will this tank bag fit a klr 650 ?,"This unit would work on a John Deere Tractor if the tractor has lights.  It designed for a 12V DC operating system so, if that is what your Kia has, it'll work..."
"Hello, I have a Chevrolet Sonic Hatchback, and I wanted to know if this wheel cover will fit on my wheel?",Yes you can.
Will these fit a 2011 Tiguan with a 2.OL 14 FSI engine,Specific vehicle I don't know but I would venture that it could be hooked up to any vehicles lights as it just taps into existing wiring.
How do you get them to change from flash mode A to flash mode B?,"I don't see why not. It just hooks up to the lights you want on, park lights, and a battery connection. Should work on any vehicle."
what is the amp rating?,I would assume they would work on any car as long as the headlights are not HID.  The complex circuitry and power required on HIDs might not be compatible.
how many light bulb come up for $12.99,Yes you can
Do these roof racks say Volvo on them?,I no longer have the car that it was installed on and it was three or four years ago when installed. Unfortunately I don't know to answer your question. If I remember correctly it was a straight forward installation and it did work well.
will it fit my 2004 audi a4 avant ?,I still have the instructions. I can email it to you if that's cool. I must say I haven't installed on my car yet. I'm jist too busy.
How secure is it on leather seats? The last one I had wouldn't stay put and my dogs keep sliding to the floor.,"Yes, the wiring diagram is available from Grote. I did that before I purchased the unit."
How many psi is the air compressor?,"I purchased mine as a spare and have not installed it yet. I looked at the hookup before buying, if not a link via the Amazon site, it may have been on the Grote site. Is very simple, but you do have to locate a hot wire that is ignition switched to turn the power on and off. Rich"
will this fit on a 2003 ford explorer v8?,installation instructions are easy to follow.I could not see the instructions before buying.
Will this item fix a 2014 fx cruiser HO?  Is the part # the same as the 2013?,"My 2009 Ford F-150 did not have the option for daytime running lights. My purchase of the Grote 44040 Daytime Running Light Module and since I am no whiz at auto electronics, I found it best to bring it to an Audio Electronics shop and have them install them professionally. Well done and no hassles. More installation instructions and tips can be  read at: Autohttp://tl.acurazine.com/forums/showthread.php?p=14271689"
hi I want to know if this item fit in my honda shadow aero 2006 750cc,A 2011 fx35 is factory equipped with drl lights. But otherwise it should work. May be more difficult to use with that harness and the factory hids. Not a recommendation from my point of view
does this fit 2007 suburban LTZ,should be able to use on any 12 volt vehicle.
Can this cycle the abs pump (so that you can purge air out of it)?,"Frankly, I purchased the Daytime Running Lights from J.C. Whitley, who matched up my Ford F-150 for the proper unit. I had it installed by an AudioMotive shop. Suggest you run it through JCW to see if it is an exact fit for your vehicle."
"If the button is pushed in will it stop the flow, and if it's out it will work normaly?","As far as I can tell, there isn't a reason that it shouldn't work. If the factory daytime running lights are not working, this would be a cheap fix for them. I would make sure the fuse for the DRL is removed, or the module or wiring disconnected so they don't both try to activate the DRL at the same time."
Does this fit the 2014 Titanium version? It looks like it has a black plastic piece behind the mirror that goes half way down the windshield.,"Sorry, I don't know if this will work on your Infiniti"
can this item mount to a flat window?,"Don't know, sorry"
What are the dimensions of the rack?,"You would have to check with Grote for that, I have no idea what system the Infinity uses."
What is the proper torque to mount this?,Sorry not sure
What  is a type k thermo couple?,"Yes they are removable , about the size am not sure but approximately 52 mm"

Show Less",Yes.. and yes.
Can one use the miter platform on the belt portion of the machine? And ... can the belt platten be removed for slack-belt sanding?,They are easily removable from the housing. I'm not sure the exact measurements. I would have to check that. What measurement are you looking for? The outer dial of the gauge or the diameter of the hole needed to fit the gauge or body of the gauge? Does that make sense? lol
Will this part work on a 2011 GMC sierra 1500?,"The gauges are removable from the housing and the diameter is 2 1/16"".  A threaded fitting on the back of the gauge holds each gauge in the housing and can be removed by hand.  I bought the gauge set."
Does this fit the 2014 Model Ford F-150 Super Crew W/O Subwoofer?,they are removable and they are the standard 52mm guage
how do i get this personalized,It has the line for the oil pressure gauge and line and fitting for the temp gauge
Does the rails interfere with the in-bed trunk opening?,yep
what is the dimension,yes. you have to feed the temp sensor thru the firewall and install into engine block or intake. the line is metal and flexible and can't come apart from sensor to gauge pack. the oil pressure comes with fittings for engine block and compression fittings for small plastic line.
Are these tires radials or bias?,"Yes. I was able to install in my pickup successfully, without having to buy extra parts."
A special screw is required to mount this on Goldwing handlebars. Does this kit include the special screw?,"yes it does, also comes with some pipe thread bushing adapters for them."
I Just Installed And Automaticly the Chack Engine Light Gos Bat next day till today's Day Still and the Smoke Came Back... Why Chevy Astro 2 WD Year 2,Yes they are back lit
does this fit over your existing grill or does it replace it?,"Yes, they are lighted. You just need to hook up a 12v power source for the lights to work."
How is this installed?  I assume it's 3M adhesive tape and no drilling is required?,Yup. lighted with 12v bulb.
does this fit a 2014 rubicon unlimited,yes they are!
Are the ends of the tubes plastic inserts or are they part of the steel tube itself?,yes they are lighted. they have worked fine on my tractor since i put them in
"Will this belt extension fit  a chrysler Pacifica touring 2006- front drivers seat (i don't see a place to add my picture) My seat belt latch is 1"" wide with two openings inside","Yes, each gauge has it's own light. Good gauges, buy them."
I wonder if the caps fit 1998 honda accord EX V6? thank you,"I would say that they could withstand quite a bit of vibration, although the needles would be a little erratic but still readable. As for waterproof, they are not submersible but they certainly could get wet occasionally and still be ok. I think they would be fine to mount on your Harley."
is this gloss finish or semi gloss or matte? thanks,No. Not waterproof exposed back. Its just a plastic housing for the gauges to keep water out . I mount  them nude the dash of trucks. . You'd have to make a custom enclosure to house it in out  what ever your choice material. They have withstood hell for vibration in trucks
What is the maxium width adjustmant for mounting?,"yes, the vibrations should be acceptable however this is not marine rated gauge set."
"Does this light come with switches, resistors if required and all of the wiring needed?",Besides the fact that it would look horrible. No I don't feel that it would withstand either of those.
How easy does the old glass pop out and the new glass go in? What tool did you use?,i mounted these on my tractor. i would say they vibrate about as much as they would on your bike. the tractor sits under a roof however i do work it in the rain. they have given me no problems in the couple years in use. very happy with bang for the buck
"I was thinking of putting this on my old body style chevy tahoe but I am worried about the bulb life, can you replace these bulbs with LEDs?","Hi ,Nylon tubing is 1/8"" and 72"" long .Brass reducer bushing adaptor is 1/4""Hope this helps Chris"
"The description says ""The carrier secures the kayak on its side,.""... Shouldn't it secure kayaks hull down (ie:rightside up)?.",1/8 to 3/16 in dia.I don't know if they have copper tubing that size they give you a lot of the plastic tubing you just have to make sure you keep it away from your exhaust manifold or anywhere else it may melt
does this come with the wiring harness,"Josh, we sell the CP7584 1/8"" x 6 Ft copper tubing kit to mate with this all our gauge sets.   thank you for the question"
will it fit a 2012 chrysler town and country?,"O.D. is 1/8"" of an inch"
how do they mount to the truck?,Sunpro copper tubing installation kit for pressure gauges. Part # CP7584. Available at most local auto parts stores.
Will this work for the upstream air/fuel sensor on a 2002 sienna?,i have done a lot of mechanic work in the past so this was a breeze to install. depends on your mechanic skills

2010 sel + sho style sopiler .. is it ok? or have to take other ? (from korea),No problems at all with the install.
"hi! are these arms for the window or the gate? i am not sure, they are for a 1998 chevrolet blazer 4 door. thank you! good night!","I have not used any scientific measures to determine the accuracy of the gauges, but it seems to be fine. IMO, It gives you an idea of what is happening with your coolant temp. Certainly better than just a trouble light. Airflow shouldn't be an issue because the sensor is immersed in coolant and not exposed to air. Besides, it goes in place of the the stock sensor which is where the manufacturer placed it for accuracy. Just follow the instructions and it should go well. BEST WISHES."
i have a 07 ezgo txt golf cart will this plug into it,It works great SunPro has been around for 50 years.
is it one or two?,"It is plenty accurate. You can get a better set but, for the money, these are very good."
how much should i use on a typical small car?,Long as you hook it up correctly... it will read correctly... sunpro  is made by Snap on tool company. More quality then what people think. I have abused them an still going strong
Does this have holes to mount foot pegs,"Fairly accurate, have not checked it with anything else. The airflow will not effect the sensor as it is in the coolant."
will it fit a 97 Mitsubishi Diamante?,the heat gauge is fairly accurate and the sensor is in the intake manifold reading the temperature of the coolant and transferring the reading to the gauge inside the car or truck so the air flow would make very little difference in the reading I have a 1967 Camaro  327 and the gauge is giving me a good reading
Are they bright enough to be seen in full sunlight?,Temp. gauge works perfectly on my son's Classic Mini . ( +/- 180° when car is running and +/- 195° when car is stopped )
will these fit a 2013 titan,"gauges are junk.only 1 out of three worked for one week....price low,but"
will these hubcaps fit my 2012 honda civic dx coupe?,I am not familiar with Honda. If your Prelude uses pipe thread for for the fluid ports. This kit does contain pipe thread adapters to tap into.
why won't they fit a 2012 Roadglide?,Yes it will work. Yes it has all the parts for your Honda.
Are these LED's dimmable?,It comes with sensors and fittings to be hooked up to engine.  Works great in my jeep.
Will this fit 1999 F250 Super Duty?,I'm not sure. I used them on an Oldsmobile.
